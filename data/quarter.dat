+1	This book is such a life saver.  It has been so helpful to be able to go back to track trends, answer pediatrician questions, or communicate with each other when you are up at different times of the night with a newborn.  I think it is one of those things that everyone should be required to have before they leave the hospital.  We went through all the pages of the newborn version, then moved to the infant version, and will finish up the second infant book (third total) right as our baby turns 1.  See other things that are must haves for baby at [...]
+1	I bought this a few times for my older son and have bought it again for my newborn. This is super easy to use and helps me keep track of his daily routine. When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work, it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go. When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated. The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk, etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work. Excellent for dads to keep track as my husband can quickly forget what time he fed our son. LOL
+1	This is great for basics, but I wish the space to write things in was bigger. A lot times I need struggle trying to read what the caretaker wrote in because the spaces go together.
+1	This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.
+1	During your postpartum stay at the hospital the nurses will ask you to keep a log of your baby's feedings, urination and bowel movements. However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in. The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for. In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk. For a while I wasn't sure what was giving him horrible gas, so I started to track what I ate in case it was a food allergy (we have a peanut allergy in the family). We even write notes about his first smile, who came to visit, ect to keep in his memory box.
+1	This book is a great way for keeping track of daily changing and feedings.  My only wish is that it was in a 24 hour format.  But other than that it is great.
+1	Easy to use, simple! I got this when my baby was 2 months old and love it. It makes it easy to track things and write down developmental notes in an organized way. I know moms who create spreadsheets of their baby's nap times, etc. But I'm not one of those people! This book is practical and great!
+1	This item was extremely helpful, especially with 3 adults sharing baby care responsibilities. My husband of mom didn't have to wake me up to ask when the baby had eaten or been changed. It helped me keep a written record to take to Dr appts so I had all the information they ask you for on hand already, and even helped me note and analyze baby's sleep patterns once he got a little older. Definitely a useful item to have.
+1	Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!
+1	I didn't think I would really use this and I was wrong.In the hospital they were constantly asking &#34;when was her last diaper?&#34;, &#34;when did she eat and for how long?&#34; - ummmm I was on pain killers for a c-section and a mass of hormones. I finally got this out and started keeping track using this.Yes, you could just use regular paper, but I liked the layout of the pages and it was just what we needed a we slowly lst our minds for the first 6 weeks.I an on giving this as a shower gift to the next first time mom :)
+1	I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks.
+1	We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the "Notes" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps "Dad" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!
+1	I have been using this baby tracker for three months and it has been very useful.  My little one had feeding issues and it was necessary to explain his habits and behavior to the pediatrician and several lactation consultants.  His feeding issues also contributed to sleep issues, which I was also able to track in the journal.  After weeks of sleep deprivation, the Dark Period, I could easily respond to the pediatrician's questions by referring to entries in the baby tracker.It's nice to look back at the Dark Period and see how far we've come.
+1	Love this book! Just finished our first one and am starting a second one.  It makes life much easier knowing my child's meal and nap times. Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well. I recommend this to all new moms! Especially during those first few weeks/months when growth spurts are common and you can't remember anything because you haven't slept much!
+1	I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old. I was having problems remembering how much she was eating, whether she was sleeping better or not. This helped me keep track of those things and more. I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she's older. I kept notes about her moods, what she did during the day. It even became a good tool to use with my nanny once I went back to work.
+1	Easy to track feeding, playtime, changes, naps etc.  Very helpful when nursing and even when you move on to a bottle. I work F/T so it's great to come home and peruse his day (feeding schedule, play time)  as a secondary account after talking to nanny. Would highly recommend for those Type-A personas.
+1	The layout of the hours are a little tricky but it does the job.  The print on each page is a light grey, so trying to journal diapers, bottles, meds in the middle of the night is a challenge.  It is detailed in slots to make notes and I would prefer a journal that does not take space for breast-feeding if one chooses formula only.  I could use the space to make more notes and comment on something cute that day.
+1	Please, please take this to the hospital with you- you'll thank me later. We did, but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO &#34;out of it&#34; dealing with my c-section,, etc. We  had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby's feedings and diaper output (so crucial those first few days). We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns. Can't recommend enough!
+1	This has been my go to for my scheduling of my twins. They are four months old now and I have their care givers fill this in when they can. That way I have an idea of the schedule they are developing. I highly recommend this!
+1	While I love the app on my phone (Baby ESP) for my husband and I-- it's not realistic for someone filling in to download the app. Our parents, who frequently watch our baby, have yet to embrace the app world.So, we use this on days when we have help. It keeps track of everything the doctor will ask you. (How many poop diapers, how many pee diapers, how often are you feeding, how often is he sleeping, what's his schedule like). We usually end up entering the data when we get home so our app can tabulate everything for us in easy to read charts.I kind of like this too because it helps us to review what was going on during the day while we weren't at home.
+1	The Daycare workers were offended by the book at first but after explaining its usefulness they realized how handy it is becoming.
+1	This product is awesome. It was so helpful to keep track of feedings and diaper changes in those early, sleep-deprived days. Would definitely recommend and will likely purchase again for our next baby.
+1	This was a lifesaver especially during the first couple of months.  Being a new mom (and dad) we were exhausted and I can't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed, changed, etc. without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day.  It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need.  It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent (or whoever).  Once this ran out I bought another type of journal and am wishing I had just bought this one again.
+1	I loved this tracker so much, I bought several more and used for the entire first year. It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms.
+1	I really like these and so do my kids.  They like to roll them around as well as nesting them.  The only thing that could be improved is for there to be 5 cars.  4 is just kind of a random number to teach a young child to count to.
+1	These are such nice cars to teach little ones numbers and the stacking value.  Ours have been scooted across the floor, cat's tail, into walls, you name it and they've always come back for more.  It's just a nice change from the nesting blocks and it's fun to hear all the vehicle sounds that children make with these guys.  I'd buy them again for sure!
+1	These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.
+1	We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!
+1	I was looking for something different than your typical stacking cups for my sons birthday.  His aunt got him these.  What a hit! My son can't quite stack them himself, but he knows how to nest them and sure does love knocking them down when I stack them.  They also have the function of just being play cars, which is nice.  I am amazed at how long my son will play with these!
+1	This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.
+1	This book keeps my 2-year-old entertained for a decent amount of time, and I like that it's washable.  It has a good number/variety of activities in it, especially as compared to other similar types of books.There are some activities for babies, but I think toddlers/pre-schoolers will get the most use out of it.  My daughter has a hard time getting the snaps on/off (they require a little extra &#34;elbow grease&#34; and/or for you to hold down the fabric on the page).  There are also some &#34;older&#34; activities, like the clock, or tying a shoe.Overall, good purchase.
+1	my 3 and 4 year old love this book. we take it to church to entertain them and each week they are excited to get it out
+1	I bought this book for my almost 2 year old daughter hoping it would be a nice activity on a plane trip. It is well constructed and attractive (though I must say not as nice as the quiet book my mother sewed for me as a toddler).The activities are:Page 1: Shape matching, different colored shapes match to same shaped outlines with velcro attachments. The velcro spots are a little small and flimsy.Page 2: Clock - the hands move freely, well constructed (my daughter isn't ready to learn the time but likes moving the arrows and talking about numbers)Page 3: Buttoning flowers to same colored buttons (this is too hard for my daughter to accomplish but I have her tell me where to button it by matching colors)Page 4: Tie the shoe - wish the string were a little longer which would make the task easierPage 5: Zip up the dress - my little one likes zippers - wish it had the ability to zip completely open so she could practice matching up the ends of the zipperPage 6: Buckle the pants buckle - this one is tricky!Page 7: Snap balloons on to color matched strings - the plastic snaps take a decent amount of pressure to apply and are a little hard to accomplishPage 8: 4 different texture and color swatchesOverall I think this book will last a long time and my daughter will be able to appreciate it more as she grows older.
+1	My son loves to chew on things and is still awaiting his first tooth. His older brother had the strawberry vibrating teether but I prefer this one because it doesn't look so feminine and it is also less expensive.
+1	While I sort of wish I could change the batteries in these things instead of buying a new one when it dies (my little guy HAS to have it vibrate), this was a life saver for me when both my kids (one 4 years and one 6 months) were/are teething. And for my youngest, it's just about the only thing that works.
+1	My daughter likes this one. She especially loves the rattle at the end and the vibrating motion. I believe this is for babies that are a little more older. I gave this to her when she was 4 months since she keeps on sticking items in her mouth.
+1	Our teething little five month old girl can't really make it vibrate, but the eight month boy grandchild does.  He likes it OK.
+1	Great teething ring and toy.My 6 mth loves it, its so much fun.he loves the vibration, the little color wheel to the other end he loves to spin.something fun to bite on for his aching gum.I recommend it!
+1	The teether just arrived for my ten month old who seems to be cutting his second tooth.He's already figured out how to activate the vibration.  It is soft, yet has some ridges and bumps that he is pulling with his teeth and gums.  I think baby gives it 5 stars!!!There were contradictory reviews on whether the batteries were replaceable or not- the packing says they are NOT.  So unless whoever said they were replaceable is just handier than the rest of us, they do not appear to be replaceable.
+1	I am so glad we invested in this product....at the time the baby was teething like a feind and this was a life saver!!!
+1	A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don't really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!
-1	This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he's teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.
+1	I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy.
+1	The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.
+1	I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it's a smart packaging extra to have the 'free ring' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes.
+1	It is somewhat difficult for my daughter to get it to vibrate, but when I help she seems to get one relief.  Cute toy snd she seems to like it even when it isn't in her mouth.
+1	Both my daughters loved this teether. It made them happier than any other product on the market, including a certain rubber giraffe.
+1	Initially, my baby was not able to cause it to vibrate on his own because he just wasn't chomping down hard enough. But now, he can do it. Now, he's able to see the cause and effect of using this. I like that. Plus, I think it feels good on his gums.
+1	At first my 7 month old could not initiate the vibrating on her own. However after only a day or two she figured it out and seems to enjoy it but still seems to prefer Sophie over anything else. Actually her favorite thing to chew on (she's just now getting her first tooth) is my little coach wallet- I guess she likes the leather or something but she is quite obsessed with it! This massaging teether does keep her busy in the car seat though.
+1	At first he was unsure about it, but now he likes to use it. I would say it's more a fun toy to chew on and not actually providing teething relief
-1	I thought this would be great for my teething baby, but the vibration freaks him out.  He wants nothing to do with it.  =(  It might be a wonderful product for other babies, though!  It appears to be well-made.
+1	Both of my kids have loved this during the teething stage.  The one complaint I have is that they have to really bite down hard to get it to vibrate so I often found myself squeezing it for them as they pulled it to their mouths
+1	Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.
+1	My son really likes this teether.He likes the bottom as well as the vibrating side.My only issue is that it is a bit large and a bit heavy,and he tends to slam it a lot (often on my hand or leg)when I am holding him. Overall, a winner
+1	We bought multiples of these, just so we'd have them.  It vibrates while our little 9-month-old bites on it!  He never took a pacifier, but this toy is the closest thing--sometimes when he's screaming, this toy is the only thing that'll calm him down.  So glad we found it.  Definitely worth the money.
+1	This is one of my twin sons favorite teethers, but they are only six months old and right now it is too heavy for them to hold by themselves, so we have to sit and hold it in their mouths for them.  This is not a huge deal, and I'm sure in another month or so they will be able to manage, but I just wanted to let other parents know that this is not something you can just hand your baby.  Having said that, when we do hold it for them, they love it and want to gnaw on it for at least 15 minutes or so.  Also, it is different from other teethers in that when they are done using it, they don't seem like they are still in pain and need to go gnaw on something else.  They actually seem like they feel better, so we are able to give them less ibuprofen which I feel is really a good thing.
+1	Our teething baby absolutely loved loved this product and would seek it out to sooth his sore gums.  Its lasted a year now with no issue or wear and tear.
+1	A favorite in our house!
-1	I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, "safety tested" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear "BPA free" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn't the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I'm sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I'm still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.
+1	My daughter is 6 mo and loves these. No funky smell, bpa free. Just dont kneel in them! The star has rounded edges. So far so good.
+1	My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time.  It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well.
-1	This would have been an ok teething necklace if it weren't for the Star bead. As another reviewer pointed out, if your child chews on the pointy edge of the star it can be very painful. I have thrown this necklace out after having to pull off the road last week when my child screamed suddenly in the back of the car and was then crying hysterically.
+1	I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes.
+1	My son loves this.  He likes the &quot;kangaroo&quot; position best. He was actually crying the first time we put him in it this way, and stopped immediately.  DEFINITELY make sure the one you buy comes with the video, though.  At our Babies R Us many were just in plastic bags (returns?) without the book and video.  They are a must.  The usual type carriers which have baby putting all their weight on their pelvic bone aren't good for their developing bones.  Slings keep the baby in more natural positions.
+1	fitted co-sleeper sheet, exactly like the one that came with the original bed. no shrinking in wash. shipped fast. will again in other colors.
+1	The color is a close match. It is a good quality sheet. I would recommend to anyone who purchased the co-sleeper so you can change the sheet after spit ups
+1	it's bright and colorful, and is great for babies who are starting to reach for things. i don't think it was worth $15 though. it's not the most durable stroller toy i've seen, but it's cute.
+1	my daughter loves this for the past four months (she is 9 months now).  Still will play with it.  only reason i didn't give it a five star was that the food cup in the bug comes off way too easily.
-1	I received this as a gift, unforutnately it didn't fit on our stroller (pretty standard Graco Travel System) or on our carseat (either our Grace or our Marathon) and so it was pretty useless.
+1	This is a fantastic product. It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy.
+1	Turned out to be a total stink bomb. Read my new review.  It absolutely reeks after 16 months.  Amazon will not let me alter the star rating or it would be only one starDo NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  It WILL STINK TERRIBLY in a little over a year because they put a foam and cloth gasket (porous) to keep the stink in.  Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.  That smell can bowl you over.*3) Easy enough for visitors to use- too difficult for them to play with.  Many of the "grown-ups" in my world can't help but tinker with whatever new items are placed before them.  I'm thrilled they can't figure out how to open the DC.  As it emits a powerful odor when the lid is opened, I'm happy they can't figure it out.  I think this lid will confound any toddler, but it's really simple for parents once you get the concept down.I just wish it could empty its own "payload."  I'll definitely be first in line for the Diaper Champ robot.
+1	I love the Diaper Champ!  I have no problems with odor at all.  And you don't have to buy or use special, expensive bags!  Any trash bag will work and it's great.  I like the odor shield bags and they work like a charm.  Easy to use one handed!!  Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed.
-1	I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags, we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail, and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.  Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.  Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell!  Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid, something I could have bought for cheaper.
+1	Diaper Champ is great.  But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.  So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
+1	It makes so much more sense to just use regular kitchen trash bags, more cost effective. It is easier to use. There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well "hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers". Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable. I highly recommend it to anyone!
+1	I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).  I love this diaper pail! My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).  My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.  The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.  Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!
+1	Works great! NO smells and holds lot of diapers. Uses standard kitchen bags! What a great product!
+1	We've used this diaper pail for 16 months now and smell never escapes from it (except when we open it to change the bag). We use plastic trash bags from Target, we pay I think $4 for 100 bags. It's a deal and works great. I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.
+1	I love these pails so much that we have two of them doing diaper duty!! It's odorless, effortless, and holds many diapers!  I also like the fact that you do not have to buy special bags for it and can use ordinary trash bags. A great invention!!
+1	I have three children.  For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky. I would not recommend buying that one.  My second child I didn't get any.  Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.  I have to say that I am very happy with it so far. I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it. I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.  It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.  I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.
+1	This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!
+1	I highly recommend this product for several reasons:1) You do not have to buy bag refills.  You can use regular trash bags which cuts down on additional spending.  The trash bag is also very easy to take out and to put in.2) Traps in stinky diaper odor.  We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.  You just put the diaper into the slot and turn the handle, the plunger pushes the diaper into the bag.
+1	At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it's been great so far.  (We'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It's so easy to use and you don't have to buy the special bags.  We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!
+1	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag. No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise! I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
+1	I had checked into all of the pails before I had my little girl.  I heard great things about all of them, but wanted what would be most cost effective for us.  When we decided on the diaper champ, we won!1.  No refills to every buy.  you can use a standard trash bag and you don't have to spend the extra money for those refills.2.  I empty mine once a week on trash day and it is full.  However, there is never a smell eminating from my champ.3.  No stinky smells in my home.  Even though my daughter is only 2 months old, she has some of THE stinkiest diapers I have ever smelt!  But, there has never been any leakage of smell and it does not stink when I open it to change it.4.  I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.  Since those stinky diapers camp out in there for a week, it needs to be freshened up every now and then.Verdict:Get the champ....it will save you tons in the long run!!!
+1	you can use any ol' bag with this. go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags. they fit it perfectly. you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop. byebye poopy diaper! it can hold quite a few. we only need to change the bag once a week. it really does hide the smell. the diaper champ is the best!
+1	The diaper champ is such a great product.  I keep it in my baby's bedroom in a corner and it has never produced any foul odors.  I love that I can use regular trash bags with it.  I only have to empty the bag once every 2 weeks (since most of the diaper changes happen downstairs).  But, even going that long, it does not smell.  I would never use one that required refills, what is the sense in that when this one works perfectly?!
+1	I love my Diaper Champ. My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it. It's simple to use and is cost efficient. The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want. As far as some people saying it smells, I haven't had a problem. Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away. I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!
+1	I love this product.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I use cloth diapers and diaper covers, and it doesn't have a whole lot of room for this type of diapers.  It lasts me about 2 days.... 3 if I really stretch it.It has no odor, other than when you open it, but that is inevitable.Infact, the Babies R Us in my area uses this product in their &quot;mother's room&quot;.  That seems to say alot!And the best part is that its cheapest over the long run... no special bags to buy... what a pain that seems to me.  I use plain old garbage bags... or even very large shopping bags.Great product.
+1	I agree it's better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It's very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.
+1	I used to live in an apartment basement with NO WINDOWS and this 'stroke of genius' diaper champ did not smell at all! I ended up not even having to wash out the inside until 4mnths later! Sounds gross I know but that's how awesome it really is! AND it's super easy to use and you don't have to buy bag refills. Need I say more?
+1	What I liked:  Contained the smell.  Ease of use.  Takes regular garbage bags (saves money!).  Great capacity (empty it out once in 7 days or so). Sturdy. Easy to clean - I wipe it down with Clorox wipes.What I didn't like: Not especially good-looking and at times the lid gets stuck in a certain position (could just be a problem with mine) hence the four stars.Would buy again though and do recommend it. (I have used the Diaper Genie at a friend's place - didn't like it).
+1	We orignially registered for and received the Diaper Genie and had problems with it from the day our son came home from the hospital.  When he was three days old my husband took it back to the the store and announced that he was coming home with the Diaper Champ.  We LOVE it!!!  The fact that it uses regular garbage bags is a huge advantage and we have never had any problems with the smell. . .impressive considering some of the dirty diapers I have seen my son produce.  He is now six months old and the Champ works as well as it did when we purchased it.  In addition, it's very easy to use.  Just flip the handle and the diapers fall through to the bag.  Couldn't be simpler.  We love this product so much that when I see people at the store looking at the Diaper Genie vs. the Champ I will go up to them and tell them to select the Diaper Champ.
+1	It holds odors pretty well. Its great to be able to use any kind of trash bag you want with it. I do admit, older children's diapers are a bit too stinky in the diaper champ, but I never said this product was a miracle worker. I'm really happy with it and would recommend it to all of my friends and family.
+1	Diaper Champ works great! You can use your regular garbarge bags with it. No need to buy re-fills.
+1	I love this diaper pail...you can use any trash bags...I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch! It's so easy to use. I didn't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months. Once she started eating more "real" foods, her diapers became much smellier. She's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ. We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers, but I think it's a great product!
+1	It is so easy to use. You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag. I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.
+1	Easy to use, easy to clean, cheaper to use, not bad-looking either. Any plastic shopping bag will work in this diaper pail. The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it. But it will certainly be an even greater challenge for your child to open!
+1	This is a fine product and I am happy with it.  I clean it weekly and since my daughter is on formula now, I never put poop diapers in it and therefore it never smells bad.  My favorite thing is that you can use any plastic sack store bag.  My only complain is that the part that you hook the bags to doesn't connect to anything to hold it up when cleaning.
+1	OK - my husband used to leave restaraunts when a couple with a baby in a diaper came in, but he doesn't even mind emptying the Diaper Champ at all.  (I know that's mostly because he's responsibile for those diapers now, but it's still a great product!)  We have NEVER noticed a diaper odor anywhere, not even while replacing the bag.Every time one of my husband's friends' wives gets pregnant, my husband buys the guy the Diaper Champ, AND THEY ALL LOVE IT!We have much less diaper odor than my firends with same-age babies have with Diaper Genie.  Also, they say that when you change bags in Diaper Genie, the stench is unbearable.  There isn't a bag-changing smell with Diaper Champ, because the diapers do get some air when the top is flipped to add a diaper.  Aerobic decomposition smells better than anaerobic decomposition, and whatever is going on in there, you smell it when you change bags.We do empty it twice a week (it gets full that often, anyway).It did get stuck a couple of times when it was WAY TOO FULL.  Letting it get too full and leaving it too long may contribute to odor issues, too.Not having to buy special bags saves us lots of time, hassle, and money.I do have one friend who "retired" hers to the back porch because of odor.  Her daughter was nearly two years old by then, and the contents of her diapers are a lot different from the contents of an infant's diapers.
+1	This product was silly to me until my husband insisted me to put on up on my baby registry. I thought it would be silly to just throw away dirty diapers in there where I could just throw it in the trash can to save money. Then again, it was very useful since I have it next to the changing table. One, its holds seal tight of no smell in the baby bedroom. Two, no mess. Three, its very easy to use (all you need is to roll the handle back to dump the diaper and there it goes with a section for your next diaper). Well, my husband and I are very happy to get this in the mail.EDITED: 1/9/06At first I said it was great. But now I'm saying it stinks. It smells after about 3 months if you dont clean the champ itself. Such a hastle right? I think so, so I am going to recomment this item from great diaper champ to NOT SO GREAT DIAPER CHAMP. It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS! if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room. I still think old fashion trash can with a lid do much better cause one you know its full, you will throw the trash away. Im giving this a 1 start out of 5 stars.
+1	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended. The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment. The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight. I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it. That would be my only complaint.
+1	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag. The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are. I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
+1	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills. The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
+1	This diaper pail is great and even better that you don't have to worry about running out of bags. You can use just regular trash bags which is awesome. I have three complaints, the first is that you can only use about half the trash bag because of the way it dumps them in there which is kinda a waste. The second is that it doesn't twist shut like the genie does so when you open up the pail you smell all the lovely smells. The last is that it's top heavy when you open it up to put in the bag so you have to manuever it to put the bag in so it doesn't fall over but it can be done. That's the only time it smells though. My baby is breast fed so the smell isn't as bad as formula fed babies but our room smells fresh and clean. These minor details wouldn't make me change my mind. I like not having to buy expensive bags especially with all the other costs a baby brings, and it does keep the smell out which is what it's supposed to do.
+1	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.  It works easily with one hand, which is important.  Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.  While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
+1	My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it's sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!
+1	This one is the best and a must have! Don't waste your time or money on the other ones.  The Diaper Genie is way too complicated.  It's a trash can so it should be simple.  I shouldn't have to read directions on how to use it!  This one is great because it is so easy to use, I never smell any odor, and it uses normal trash bags!  Why spend money on special trash bags?  I like the cheap roll of scented trash bags for like $2.00.  They work great and they are small so you can keep them in the nursery for quick and easy trash changes.
+1	Diaper Champ works well for me. It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags.  I use tall kitchen trash bags. I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it's nothing that I cannot handle.  I just use that as a sign to empty it, spray with Lysol and replace the bag.
+1	This is a good product.  It allows for quick and easy disposal of diapers, wipes, etc. and does not require any special bags.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not had any problems with it getting stuck. It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!! If you change the bag regularly, you should not have any problem with odor.
+1	I spent a lot of time researching diaper pails before I actually bought one. I spoke to other parents to see what they used and most said that the Diaper Champ was leaps and bounds better than the alternatives. Now, owning one myself, I agree. I don't have any problems with oders (uless I'm changing out the bag) and I don't have to spend tons of money on the refill bags. You will be suprised how many diapers you change and how quickly the cost of those refills add up! My son is now 3 months old and we are still on our first box of kitchen sized trash bags....I have two very small complaints which is why I didn't give the Diaper Champ 5 stars. First, I think that it could have been made a little larger so you wouldn't have to change the bags as often. Second, you have to be VERY careful when changing out the bags. The lid is heavy and if it falls on your fingers you won't be really happy. It probably happens to everyone at least once. Overall this is an excellent product and I recommend it over all others out there.
+1	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.  It works great.  I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).  I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.  It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.  The reviews were definitely right.
+1	This is a great product! It is excellent since you can use your own trash bags in it and don't have to buy special ones. You can also put the diaper in it using only 1 hand! I gave it 4 stars only since 'once in a while' if the bag is very full, I may notice a slight smell.  But it is truly worth buying! I love mine!
+1	I initially planned to get a Diaper Genie.  I opted not to because of the expensive refill bags.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.  We live in an apartment and have the Champ set up in his bedroom.  I don't smell any odors unless I open the Champ up to change the bag....which is expected when you have a bag filled with wet and soiled diapers.  We use scented Glad bags to help mask the odor, which helps.  I don't know how it will perform when I switch my son to formula and when he starts solids, so I give the Champ 4 stars.  I'll probably just put the wet diapers in it and take the soiled ones out to the garbage can.  I would definately recommend this diaper pail to my friends.
+1	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.  We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail...one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.Here's what we love about this pail...*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!! (we wrap them nice and tight)*we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!!*holds the odor in nicely! (every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol)*easy one-hand use*impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pailEvery now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.  Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.  We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.
+1	Yes, it does develop a smell after a while. However if you keep up with the maintance that problem is easily solved.Problem:  SmellAnswer:  Baking soda & regular maintanceThe great thing about the diaper champ is you can use regular bags, and it does keep the smell out. After some time with the Diaper Genie there was no way to stop the odor.Another thing, when the Champ starts stinking it is usaully past time to empty it. Empty the champ at least twice a week, if not more. We keep an air purifier in front of the diaper champ and that solves any strong smells when we don't empty it out on a regular basis.If you don't want to spend the money on the diaper champ, try a regular diaper pail with a lid. You would more than likely end up emptying the pail daily and that will keep the smell out(plus regulare maintance), and it is less expensive than the Diaper Champ.There are three diaper pails out that are cheaper:Safety 1st Diaper Pail: 8 gallons it's  a bit small$9.99 at Target & Babies R UsOdorless Diaper Pail: 13 gallons bags @ Target $16.99Easy Saver Daiper Pail: 8 gallons $14.99 @ Babies R UsI have not tried any of these so I can't honestly review them. These are if you are looking for cheaper alternative. I would buy one of these over the Diaper Genie or Diaper Dekor.I still give it 4 stars. It does it job and a lot better than the Diaper Genie or Diapre Dekor, no expensive refills. Everyone has kitchen trash bags that can be used with the Champ or regular grocery bags could be put to use. The good thing about using grocery bags is you will be emptying the diaper champ on a dialy basis therefore elimating build up on odor.I have the older diaper champ and opening the lid to empty the pail was a bit of a hassle. It is enough of a detterent. You get the hang of it.
+1	I LOOOVE this diaper pail!  Its the easiest to use!  after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.  I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!  No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!  And it holds alot more! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.  This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!  I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.  Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!  And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.  It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!  I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!!
+1	I like the fact that you don't have to purchase brand-name insert for this product, but can use any garbage bag.  I have to say, though, that after my daughter started solids, the odor control has not been great unless the bag is changed frequently.
+1	I hate the Diaper Genie so I was excited to try this Diaper Champ out and I have to say I love it. I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they're nuts! (no offense)My son is now 5 1/2 months old and is nursing but also eats most solids including table foods when were out at a restaurant. His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ.Usually we change the bag about once a week, every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week. I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me. They've got to be doing something wrong.Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned...if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do, and you get poop on the pail, it does need to be wiped off. A good wiping out with some antibacterial wipe, every week or two doesn't hurt either.
+1	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.  At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!  It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.  I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.  The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
+1	I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  MY HUSBAND AND I CHOSE TO USE CLOTH DIAPERS ON OUR SON AND THIS WORKS GREAT FOR HOLDING THEM UNTIL THEY GET WASHED.  WE NEVER NOTICE A SMELL COMING FROM IT.  WE ALSO LOVE THAT IT USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS RATHER THAN NEEDING SPECIAL BAGS.  IT HAS BEEN A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT FOR US AND WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS CLOTH DIAPERING THEIR BABY.
+1	THis is the only one I have ever used, and i have to say I LIKE IT! It is easy to use, i just put in a white trash bag and dumped the diaper down the shute. It holds a ton of daipers, and the smell is not bad at all. I did notice now that my daughter is 15 months her poop is stonger and i dont put those in there, due to the smell. But diapers with pee only do not smell at all. The only bad thing is you need to ensure you dont get #2 on the shute or if you do it will stick there. It is really easy to use, and doesn't take up a lot of space.
+1	The Diaper Champ came easy to assemble- only took 2 minutes to put together!  The design is simple, yet brilliant, and the odors are sealed inside the Diaper Champ until the bag needs to be changed.  Our baby's room never smells!  We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.  We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!
+1	We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.  We hated that thing!  The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!  The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.  And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.  We decided we had to have something so we started researching.  The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!  We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.  There is also no trick to it.  No spinning it or anyhting!  Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!  We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!  It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
-1	Ok, so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome--it is very easy to use--that's why I gave it 1 star. However...the thing REALLY stinks!! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it. However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago. I thought..."Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won't have to purchase any liners"...Well that was a HUGE mistake!! I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor! After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop! I couldn't stand it! In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times. Is that really saving money?? I don't think so! Plus her room really smelled bad. I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!
+1	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!  I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.  It was such a pain to use.  We all hated it.  The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.  And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.  It takes regular trash bags.  I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.  And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!  If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
+1	This is a great pail except for the heavy lid. Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand. The seal did come out, but it does not affect the odor. This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days. I wish it was a little bigger.I do recommend this pail!!!
+1	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!  Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.  Only problem...it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.  The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
+1	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all. This one is really great. I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did. I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted. Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!! We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month. The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome! We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great. We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!! We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems. Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!
+1	I love the Diaper Champ!  Everyone I knew had the Diaper Genie but had to buy expensive refills and did not like all the twisting involved.  After reading reviews of the Diaper Champ, I put it on my baby registry and I am glad I did.  It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.  Also, be sure the tabs on soiled diapers are secured to the diaper or they will get stuck up under the cylinder on the way down.
+1	The champ is great because you don't have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.  This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!  Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!
+1	This diaper pail is a wonderful investment. While other diaper pails require the use of thier own bags this pail uses any bag...including old shopping bags. This save alot of money. When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps. I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.
+1	Love it, love it, love it!  I love that you can use regular plastic bags and don't need to buy refills for it.  Once in a great while it will stink a bit but only when I used too big of a bag and have a LOT of diapers in there.  Wipes up nice and clean with antibacterial wipes.  My daughter is starting potty training and I'm still using it.  Great buy!
+1	I thought the idea of keeping dirty diapers in the house was just gross, so I decided to make 20 trips a day to the trash.  Boy, was I misguided in my thinking,because this diaper champ is a Godsend!  You really do not smell a thing! I heard the diaper genie was a huge mess, so I did not even attempt to buy it.  Get this and limit those trips out to the trash!
-1	After reading the glowing reviews here and receiving a positive one from a friend, we decided to replace a broken Diaper Genie (lid broke off) with the Champ.  What a disappointment!  Here are the big two complaints:1.  It's unsanitary.  Putting diapers and messy wipes into the slot and dumping them in the bucket leaves the slot a germy mess.  Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work!  And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2.  The smell.  It's probably not as bad with an infant, but let me tell you, opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience!  Yikes, what a smell after just a couple days.  We used the odor prevention garbage bags, but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid.  Since nothing seals off the individual diapers, it's just a sea of messy diapers in there.  Yuck.On the plus side, it's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags, not the expensive ones the Genie requires.  And it's certainly easy to use.  But I'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year, we'll be going back to the Diaper Genie.  It's not perfect, but it's much cleaner and there's less odor involved (the reason to get one of these products in the first place).  And the new version of the Genie is much easier to operate than the earlier model, so we'll just cross our fingers the lid stays attached next time.
+1	I love this product!  With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.  Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.  No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
+1	I thought about getting the diaper genie at first but then did some research. This is the best for your money! Not only was it less expensive than most other diaper pails, it also works the best. The only time smell escapes from it is then you open it to take out the bag. I really love how you don't have to buy bags for it, and that it takes perfectly good trash bags. That will save you a bundle of money alone! It works really great for us and we wouldn't use anything else. I wish it would hold more diapers but I really can't complain. Don't buy anything else!
+1	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!!!! The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags...ANY Garbage bags will fit. The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend...This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers....FANTASTIC!
+1	The Diaper Champ is excellent.  I have experienced no issues with odor, in fact I keep this in my baby's closet.  No special bags are needed ... what a savings!  Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy!  Great value for an excellent product.
-1	When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills. While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags, that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired. My son's room smelled very badly, even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience. Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine. Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around.
+1	Unlike the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers. We have two of them since we mostly use cloth, but occasionally need to use a disposable. It's great, and very easy to use, but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers. It's so easy to use, my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun. She's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail.
+1	I chose to register for the Diaper Champ for convenience.  You can use a plain ole garbage bag instead of purchasing something separate.  What busy mom has time to run out to get special bags?  In 5 months I've had one instance of a terrible smell and it was just a really bad diaper - we all know those.  :)  It's very easy to clean and so easy to use.
+1	I like the Diaper Champ because it doesn't use specific bags.  I don't like how easily it gets backed up though.  I have to frequently push down the center to get it to rotate, much before it needs to be changed.
+1	I've used the genie in the past and much prefer the Diaper Champ. I'm all about practicality when it comes to baby products and the Diaper Champ is right in line with my views.Very easy to use,(my senior citizen parents figured it out...lol), controls odor well and USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS...woohoo! Who wants to spend money all the time for "fancy" trash bags. Buy the diaper champ and save the money for something fun for baby.
+1	I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.
+1	The best thing about this product is you don't have to purchase their bags.  It does certainly reduce the odor but the bag still needs to be replaced regularly otherwise the odor will sneak up on you.
+1	I love this! I was hesitant to buy too since the "sheet" is expensive and hardly a "sheet" at all. But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof. If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet. You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats. We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it. This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!
+1	It's kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet (and never having to change the crib sheet), but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight.  Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this, it got a bit easier.  It's not super fast to unsnap and snap on, but better than replacing the crib sheet (esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out).I have 3 of these so I don't have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough.  Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric, unfortunately.
+1	I have been using these sheets for 6 months.  I have two Ultimate Crib Sheets, and when my 6 month old has diaper leaks or blowouts while sleeping, I can easily switch to the new ultimate sheet.  They are machine washable and dryer safe, which I LOVE, considering I am doing baby laundry multiple times a week.  Putting regular sheets on crib mattresses is a huge hassle, so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is a huge help for middle of the night diaper leaks.  It takes me much less time to switch these out than to change the whole sheet.  I leave baby's cute sheets on the mattress and use this on top.Size: Both of mine shrank a tiny bit in the dryer, but it is not a problem at all.  They fit flat on top of a regular crib-size mattress.Material:  The top side is a breathable, soft cotton layer.  The bottom side has a soft, waterproof plastic feel.
-1	I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth. Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort: it's made of  lightweight foam. As a result, changing her sheets is also super easy. I just have to lift the mattress, and it takes two seconds. On the other hand, snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus, the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash, which means snap on crib, unsnap, snap again before wash, unsnap, snap on crib...) So, if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room, I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners. If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room, then by all means, try the ultimate crib sheet...
+1	My mom said to get enough crib sheets because it was something you had to change constantly.... I now have a drawer full of crib sheets that have never been used!  This is the best thing ever!  we put one on, and have the other one for an emergency.  It is soft, the cotton is excellent quality and the work of crib changing at 3 in the morning it just went from 10 minutes to 1 minute! nothing can bit 9 minutes of extra sleep in the middle of the night
+1	Really they should hand these out at the hospital. Ever tried to change a crib sheet in the middle of the night while your kids has either puked or peed on it. No one is happy, everyone is crying. This simplifies all of that and still lets you have and see your adorable sheet set you overpaid for. The snaps are so much easier to deal with and the sheet is super absorbent. We have two so if there is an accident - one gets replaced while the dirty one is washed.
+1	I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.
+1	I really like this sheet!  It keeps the rest of my son's crib sheets dry, so easy to take off and clean. I have two so I just wash one and use the other.  Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed!
+1	I recently attended a baby shower and gave this as a gift.  The mother had requested a couple of these.  Since then she has given birth and this sheet has been working well for her.  Great idea for a baby shower gift.
+1	I absolutely love this sheet! Changing my babies sheet is effortless, thanks to this great invention. Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient, especially for those middle of the night changes! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time, but it's no big deal, and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby!
-1	The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven't used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary.
+1	These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib. I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress, and I've never taken it off. I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets. I have three; I would recommend that number. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets...this is just SO EASY snap, snap, snap and you're done!I never dry mine in the dryer. I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours. I want mine to last, and using the dryer tends to wear them out. I've never not had one on hand, with 3 total.
+1	We have something similar to this leftover from when my daughter was a baby and I wanted another, I wasn't ablt to find exactly the same pad but this is doing the job.
+1	I love this sheet!  I have 4 of them (2 for each child). It is super absorbent and stays in place! They are great for potty training accidents and for one unfortunate night with the stomach flu.  I used to wrestle with matress when changing the sheets but not anymore.  I have the pretty sheet that matches the bedding on the bottom and the crib sheet on top.  Now if there is a middle-of-the-night accident I just unsnap the cirb sheet, pull it off, and put a clean one in its place.  This is one a the gifts that I give at all baby showers because I think no Mom should be without at least 2 of these (you need a spare!)
+1	They are so easy to put on (or change when you're half asleep) and really protect the baby's sheets. I have three of them right now! You need to be careful with them in the washer and dryer (the washer sometimes ripped the backings on them and the dryer sometimes broke off the snaps) but they are so worth it!
-1	The reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old (2002-2004 isn). Recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft. Somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product. I wouldn't sleep on this so will not use it for my son's crib. As far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says...but I'll never know since I'm returning it.
+1	This is the BEST crib sheet out there! It can be simply used by itself by just fastening the straps to the sides of the crib or can be used with a more decorative sheet simply placed snugly in place over it.My daughter is now 6 months and has leaked out of her diaper on occassion, the mattress that she sleeps on cost around $120.00, so thanks to this sheet the mattress still looks the same as it did when we brougt it home.
+1	Reality is...you don't have to have this, but it really helps simplify your life if you do.  You don't have to take off the crib bumper and lift the mattress to take off this crib sheet.  Instead, you just unsnap and place a clean one on top of the mattress.  I have a regular crib sheet under the Ultimate Crib Sheet for decorative purposes and in case he needs to be placed on it if my spare is dirty.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's annoying to have to snap all of the straps prior to washing it and also because there is some shrinking that occurs after it's washed (Make sure you put it on the low setting in your dryer).  Also, they are expensive.  I have two of them and it's worked out just fine.
-1	The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this.
+1	So easy to use, it's the only one I ever used!
-1	Seemed like a good idea, but I didn't care for it. I returned it because it wasn't soft. Actual crib sheets are much nicer to look at too.
+1	This is a great product!  Buy two and put them both in the crib.  When your little one leaks in the night, just unsnap and toss the dirty one aside, and you'll have a clean one underneath.  As far as the snaps falling off, my son had pyloric stenosis (severe vomiting requiring surgery) and I washed these 3 or 4 times a day for weeks.  Never once did I have any of the permanent snaps fall (there are two completely detachable snaps on the ends that I don't even use).  I even washed and dried on the normal cycle (not gentle) in warm water (not cold, as is recommended).
-1	I thought I would love this to help do quick crib changes for when a child is sick, or has an accident/leak... however it is really annoying for me to weave the elastic around the crib slats to fasten the buttons-- really doesnt save time, and since our mattress cover is waterproof I dont really need another waterproof layer.
+1	I ordered two pack. One of them was an open item but the sheet looks fine and doesn't seem like have been used. I'm okay with that because i bought them for less than $4!
-1	This is supposed to save time instead of changing out the sheet, but I found it took just as long to change this as it does to change the actual sheet.  You have to reach all around the crib to do (or undo) all the snaps, which is aggravating and somewhat difficult depending on the placement of your crib.  Compared to just lifting up the mattress and quickly pulling off the sheet and putting a new one on, I think this might actually take longer.
+1	I have never changed the sheet on my daughter's crib.  Instead, I have 2 ultimate crib sheets that I alternate between.  I can't tell you how awesome it's been.  In general, they're easier to change than regular crib sheets.  In a pinch (ie, diaper explosion or sick baby in the middle of the night), they make life SO much easier.  Just fold the sheet up to contain the mess, take it to the laundry room, snap the new one on, and you're good to go.I've read reviews that said they didn't like this sheet, but I love it.  You don't need any other mattress pad with it, either.
-1	I've had 2 of the ultimate crib sheets and been using them for 7 months now and I do not like them. I don't hate them, but I don't like them and will never purchase them again. The idea is wonderful, but parts of the product are too cheaply made. Within the first washing, some of the snaps were pulled off the sheet (with following the directions to re-snap the sheet before washing). That was disappointing. Thankfully, it was only 2 snaps and I was still able to make the sheet function. However, it does take some time to snap the sheet on securely and it isn't very soft or cozy for baby. It has kept accidents from leaking through and it did work well in that area, but as far as adding coziness or comfort or ease of use...it failed miserably. I bought mine through Babies R Us instead of Amazon but wanted to contribute a review regarding the product because I shop through Amazon much more often. I wish I had been better informed, I would have gotten the quick zip sheets instead. The attachments for the snaps are not well made and I would not recommend this product to new moms. Go for a different crib pad that will protect and add some softness/coziness to the crib. This sheet also does not retain warmth well - even after throwing in the dryer and then putting on crib, it cools quickly and remains cool which may be nice in the summer but not during a winter in South Dakota...One more additional note, it does take a very long time for these sheets to dry - an extra dry cycle in the dryer. Not handy or helpful.
+1	These only work if you crib slats are a certain size.  Our slats are too wide and the sheet would not snap around them.  We had to jerryrig the crib by adding plastic hooks that the snaps could fit around.  This won't work for us as baby gets older.  I do like that the sheets are easy to change, clean well and allow you to keep the crib safe without having to add a lot of bedding.  This product works well with the Halo Sleep Sacks.
+1	Love this. I dont' have to keep washing the crib sheet. This makes it easier to keep my baby's bed clean.
+1	The Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet is a very useful product.  It protects the sheet, eliminating the need to change the crib sheet if there is diaper leakage or spitting up.  It goes on and off in seconds - so helpful to a Mom, especially in the middle of the night. It is large enough to cover the whole crib surface.  It seems to be waterproof and yet doesn't make the baby sweaty.My only concern would be that since it attaches to the crib rails, there is an outside chance a baby could loosen/undo a strap.I think it would be handy to have two of these to rotate them out.  I like it and would recommend it.
+1	Did not know about these initially when I registered for my first baby.  Had one during her first year.  Now having a second baby and ordered three more!  They have made nights when the baby got sick so much easier!  Our first one did pill on the cloth side but baby doesn't mind and it still serves it's purpose.
-1	I tried this out on my baby's standard size crib, and it fit horribly. The little loops that hold it down, don't seem safe at all!!! And they don't keep the sheet secure to the mattress. I don't know how they're allowed to sell these. They seem like a major safety hazard to me!!! Total waste of money!!!
+1	Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer.  We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner.  The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners.  No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side.  So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn't appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue.  If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn't seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions.  We'll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs.
+1	This pad has worked well for my son. He is 3.5 years old and we are trying to potty train him through the night. It's nice not to have to wash an entire sheet and mattress pad every time he has a small accident. It has never leaked and it's been washed many times and still retains its waterproof quality. The only reason I took off one star is because it's a little stiff and he was resistant to having it on his bed at first. He got used to it and now it is working fine.
+1	Accidents happen with little kids, this is a really easy way to make sure the bed is kept clean and dry especially if you have a loft or bunk bed you don't want to climb up to, to tear apart.
+1	For a Training pad these are super easy to use, wash and make acceptable with your kid. Have 5 of them now as we braved no diapers at night early on.
+1	This is an excellent mattress pad to use during potty training.  It's also good for the time before that just in case there are leaks.  It's very absorptive and easy to put on and take off.
+1	I absolutely LOVE the Handy's Plus Pad.  I purchased 5 of the full-size pads for my son over a year and a half ago and I think they are GREAT.  My 4-year old has slept in a full-size bed since he turned 2.  These pads really work (no leaks!), are comfortable and wash-up well.  I only have 2 complaints ... 1. the side-flaps aren't quite long enough to fully tuck under if you have a pillow-top mattress (although you can make it work if one side of the bed is against the wall and you pull the opposite side really tight)  AND  2. the top and bottom of the pad tend to "curl up" after several washings.  Despite these complaints, I have not been able to find a pad that is even near the quality and comfort of this one.  The reason that I own 5 of these is that, if you truly want "full" coverage on the bed for a child that rolls all over while sleeping, you need to use 2 with some slight overlap (so, 2 to use and 2 for back-up).  I also use one (full-size) on the Spinmaster Flip-Open Sofa to keep spills and accidents from staining the sofa.  The full-size fully covers the full-length of the sofa.  I think this is a "must have" product for parents of toddlers that don't want to be constantly changing bed sheets or trying to "wash" a children's sofa that really isn't meant to be washed.(fyi ... If you like Basic Comfort's Ultimate Crib Sheet, then you'll also like their Handy's Plus Pad.  The Handy's Plus Pad is basically the Ultimate Crib Sheet with side flaps and without the snaps.  In fact, the pad portion of the Handy's Plus Pad - Full size is almost the same size as the Ultimate Crib Sheet.)
-1	This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money. It doesn't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change. I don't even try any more to 'twist' the bag, I just take the lid off. It is very easy to open and I wonder about my son getting in it as he gets older. If this is all you can afford, it's not that bad.
-1	My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags. That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail. The springs have been popping off since about the first month. My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke, which completely gets rid of the supposed &quot;odor-free&quot; feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either).  Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can.
+1	We have used this pail for 3 years, and 2 kids.  The advantage is that this pail doesn't require any special bags. We change out the bag twice a week.  You save a lot of money if you get sheap bags at Dollar Tree or Big Lots (works out to about 10-cents a bag).  It does get stinky sometimes, but all garbage pails do and every child has an extra stinky diaper occasionally.  Roll with it and save money when and where you can.
+1	Purchased this unit to hold adult size large briefs and have been pleasantly surprised.  Holds approximately 8 soiled briefs with virtually no smell emitted (except when adding more to pail).  I wish it held more but I'm so happy to have something that helps with this &quot;unmentionable&quot; problem that I really am not concerned by the small-ish volume.  I'm having trouble finding replacement deodorizer disks though and may have to use a stick-on unit or something when a new one is required.
+1	Bought this to keep my toddler from unplugging some important plugs (ie: tv, chest freezer, etc) It works very well and is extremely secure. I actually have a very tough time getting into this. The narrowness makes this not work for adapters or thick cords. And the two small openings at the bottom of the unit are for thinner or normal sized cords only. I had a hard time getting my thicker cords through (the surge protector and chest freezer cord). I actually broke the bottom section that separates for two cords off so the larger cords would go in more easily. When I did this I was actually only able to put one cord per cover. Recommend this just for thin plugs, no adapters. Good buy for the price.
+1	I bought these to help baby proof my house.  My son gets into everything!!  These covers are fantastic.  They are sort of hard to get open when installing them.  There is no way my son will be able to open them....he's tried! haha.  Only problem is, it doesn't prevent him from pulling on the wires.  So you still need to be vigilant :)
-1	There are two pieces to the outlet cover: back part replaces the outlet cover (and needs to be screwed on) and the front cover, which is released from the back cover by squeezing the two plastic pieces on the sides. The plastic side pieces are part of the back part, made of stiff plastic and extremely difficult to squeeze. This outlet cover also did not fit one of my outlets (it would not stay flush to the wall).
+1	This things install quickly and easily if you're running standard cords (for lamps, etc.) though the holes.  If you want to run something thicker (like the wire on one of my power strips) I found I had to do a bit of modification to make it fit.  I ended up trimming the gap so it was larger on the backside plate and that did the trick.I think the ones I got are more than difficult enough to keep my son from opening them.  I'd consider them on the fence for an outlet that I'd want access to all the time, and someone with arthritis would probably want to stay away.
-1	I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover.#1: The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover. They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me, I need to go purchase a handful of screws.#2: Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic, small, two-prong plugs. So what won't fit? Our laptops, our phone charger (Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall), iPod chargers, computer charger, power strip plug, light dimming plug attached to lamp, DSLR charger, baby sound machine, Verizon Fios plugs. Well crap... what appliance plugs DID fit, you ask? A lamp. Just one lamp. Oh, and the electric toothbrushes.Useless, sending them back. The Safety 1st units are square (not pyramid shaped) and hold various plugs.
-1	The slots for the cords on the bottom of the cover are too small.  I wanted to be able to thread the powerstrip's cord up into that--but this is meant for thin wires like a lamp or something-- not a thick wire.  Also, it wouldn't cover the box of the cell phone charger, either.  This is for very basic wires and plugs.
+1	These are designed to cover plugs you leave plugged in, such as lamps or alarm clocks, so keep kids from pulling on the plugs/cords and damaging them or injuring themselves.  And that's exactly what they do.  We use several in our home and have had no problems.  They're also very easy to install with a simple screwdriver.Many of the negative reviews here complain either it is too hard to open (which is completely the point) or that it only holds "small" (aka standard) plugs, which should be obvious from the description and picture, so they're not really being fair.
+1	I have 18 month old twins, and an older child with cerebral palsey, she has a hospital bed downstairs where we all get together during the day and evening and the babies are always getting into the cords, pulling them out of the wall, came on amazon (found this) and it goes over even the thick cords for the hospital bed (3 prong) so it is well worth the money as the babies have now completely given up on the cords :)
-1	These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them.  My mom and I each held a side and pulled, but nothing.  I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart.  Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off, I had to leave the latches pushed in, defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off.  Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture.  It's too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in.  I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up.
+1	I gave this product 4/5 stars for a couple reasons:Pros - mostly keeps fingers away from the plugs and sockets but only because they can't reach the sockets with little fingers, durable, hard for a child to take apart, completely kept our first son away.Cons - harder for an adult to quickly put together and take apart, doesn't keep little extremely curious fingers out of the top hole area (though they can't reach the part that would shock them), and doesn't stop our son from unplugging the cord since there is space for the cord to be pulled upward so that the plug comes out of the socket.  The plug won't come out of the box easily, but it can still be unplugged, and since it's harder for an adult to get fingers in the top part to plug it back in, it has to be taken apart to be plugged back in.Overall, it's done the job very well, but it is big and isn't perfect (though I doubt anything is).
+1	I love this thing. It fit our large power strip easily. Also very easy to use. I would highly recommend.
-1	The only other cover I could find wouldn't fit my power strip so I ordered this one. It seems sturdy and does fit fine, but the opening is way too big. My 8 month old could definatly fit at least a few fingers all the way in and touch the plug in no problem because I could. I decided to keep it and put clear packing tape around the opening.
-1	I returned this product due to the several reasons:-  It is too bulky- I ended up pinching my finger while installing it ( do not want my child to do it since he will be trying to figure out how to open it)
+1	I love this product it keeps my son safe. I enjoy how I can reach my skinny fingers into it unplug one thing and still leave it in the power strip cover but my son can still not get into it at all. It has been great to have especially now for all the Christmas lights we have going on.
+1	This cover was alright, the hole does seem a bit large and it wasn't quite long enough for our biggest power strip, but I have yet to find a cover that is, so I can't dock any stars for that
+1	This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.
+1	So far, my 2 year old has been able to pull the cords out, but hasn't been able to get his little fingers down near the outlet, which is really the important part. One nice plus is it actually neatens the look of the power strip, instead of making it look tackier.
-1	Really? How could this possibly be useful? I saw somebody else post that the baby's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating. Really, I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier. The baby's whole hand fits through the giant gap. Plus the thing is huge. Like almost as big as a shoe box. And really ugly. I don't know what we'll replace it with since the others don't sound better, but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show. There's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room, so I might as well just leave the cords as is.
+1	We used this behind the tv for all the connects and cords. It works well and keeps all the cords from being pulled.
+1	This is the best power strip cover I have found.  We tried the Mommy's Helper cover but it doesn't shut very securely and doesn't fit some larger plugs.
+1	Nothing special...it does the job of covering what it is suppose to. Unfortunately it still draws the attention of a 9 month old baby....but nothing gets past them anyway!It is safer to just have no wires/plugs anywhere that babies can see them but if you cant this at least makes it impossible to get to outlets.
-1	It's funny how many people have positively reviewed this. Yes, it's very convenient, easy to use, and fits well. What it doesn't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs! It's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening. In fact, I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover. If I can fit my hand in there, so can a child. And it doesn't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there. This product is, in a word, worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets, or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip. But please don't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks.
+1	I bought and returned the other popular brand of power strip cover because it doesn't fit iPhone/iMac chargers.  This one does.  And it adjusts lengthwise so you can make it pretty long if you need it to.  Some other reviews mention the size of the opening on the top - it's true, it's surprisingly wide, I can usually reach in enough to pull out a plug when I need to, rather than opening the whole thing.  So could your kid conceivably pull one of your plugs out when you don't want him/her to?  Sure, but the cover is also tall enough that it would be pretty darn hard for them to stick their fingers down into the open sockets.  Bottom line: treat this as a deterrent and not a substitute for knowing when your kid's playing with power cords.
+1	Easy to use!
+1	Great option for covering your outlets from little fingers. Easy to use and store away. Adjust to different lengths by pressing the buttons.
-1	Seriously, I just got this, and this product is not worth a single penny. It is too bulky and gets in the way. Even when it is on its smallest setting! Not just that, but there is a large opening at the top for the cords to fit through, but the gap is so big, my kids can still unplug the cords and play with them.
+1	This power strip easily keeps my breast-pump plug secure. It also covered as well as the other plugs :) Easy to use and sturdy.
+1	I believe that this product would prevent a child from tampering with a power strip, but the plastic is quite thin and I was worried as I used it that it would break. As I was installing it I tried to be very careful as it seemed as though the plastic was quite thin.
+1	This works pretty well to keep little hands from grabbing power strips. It also has the option of hanging it on the wall which I really like. The things I was not happy about was the quality of the plastic seems flimsy and also if you have to hook it on the last hole due to the size of your power strip it barely stays together. For our longest strip we had to duct tape around the entire device to make sure it stays together. Other than that it's a decent little contraption that does its job.
+1	Although unfortunately for only medium sized power strips? I couldn't get this to cover my living room power strip for my electronics because it wasn't quite long enough. Great for a smaller/medium sized power strip though.
+1	Essential if you are in the process of baby-proofing the living daylights out of your apartment/house, as I am. This product not only makes the powerstip safe for kids, but it also allow your chords to be in a neat casing and not all over the floor.
-1	This powerstrip cover is pointless.  Any child can get their hand in it and get shocked.
+1	My little one looooves plug ins.  This product prevents her from unplugging my electronic devices, from trying to plug things into the power strip, and from flipping the power strip into the off position.  It keeps my child and my electronics safe!My only critique of this item is that it seems a bit flimsy when fully extended.  The power strip for my entertainment center is a pretty standard length and size and fits in this strip cover with the cover extended fully.  When extended, the cover can wiggle, and if wiggled enough, little hands could possibly figure out how to separate the two pieces, thus gaining access to the power strip.  In an effort to avoid this scenario, I have placed the product placed far enough under my entertainment center that my child would really have to reach to get to it, so the level of concentration that it would take her to both reach for the power strip and open the cover is beyond what she is capable of doing.I am still satsified with this product despite its weakness when fully extended, however, because when I placed the bare power strip in the exact same location, my daughter had no problem both reaching for the power strip and flicking it into the off position.  Furthermore, seeing all those cords, outlets, and plugs motivated her to move the power strip to where she could reach it better and within a matter of moments, she would happily turning it on and off, unplugging things, and trying to "plug" foreign objects into it.  So another thing this product succeeds in doing is making the power strip less attractive for her by covering up all the things she likes most about them- buttons, plug ins, and outlets.If this device were more readily accessible (ie: out in the open) I think my daughter would have no problem figuring out how to open it and thus rendering it useless.  It might not have the same problem with a smaller power strip because the product wouldn't need to be fully extended.
-1	Many kids have been able to remove safety devices in less than 30 seconds.  It takes less than 5 minutes for a parent to leave the room to get something and return to find their child hanging from the cords...DEAD!!!  It is safer to spend the money and go CORDLESS!!!  But if you must keep your corded blinds, get the Fashion Wand (approved by PFWBS).  Go to Parents for Window Blind Safety (PFWBS) website and read all the testimonials of kids who died or were severely injured by blind cords.  Watch the videos they have of kids bypassing or breaking safety devices on cords in less than 30 seconds.  And then decide if you want to install a safety kit or remove the danger altogether.
+1	There is no perfect solution to window blind cords, but I think these do well. I actually used this kind years ago for pets. I do usually have to open and close them to unwind, but that is okay. What is important is that they put the cord high above a child's reach. I just ordered many more for the rest of the windows. However, for the kid's room we have the kind that is screwed into to the wall and wraps the cord around, so there is no chance of these plastic parts falling.
-1	This product is useless. After installed, I could still open the oven door with my pinky finger. The directions were also unclear and the picture doesn't match the product.
+1	This device keeps the oven shut despite my toddler hanging off the oven handle (fortunately, phew!).  I tried a different lock prior to this one, which I returned as the lock kept flopping down inside the oven whenever open.  This one does NOT have that problem.  It is easy to install, and works in areas with tight clearance too.
+1	It's pretty hard to find a great oven lock.  This one had terrible reviews, but was the kind we needed for our new oven (a side lock).  We've been using it for 9 months, and my toddler (who is now almost 2) seems quite safe.  She's pulled on the handle of the oven a few times (and we've told her "no", which she seems to accept most of the time) and the lock has stayed put.  She's tried to operate the lock a few times, and has not been successful at that either.  I can see a toddler who is very interested in the lock being able to figure it out, but she has been easily diverted from it.It's held up great, and I don't find it too cumbersome to lock/unlock it whenever I use the oven (which is pretty often - I cook a lot). I have no complaints.
+1	Does what it is supposed to.  Basic and easy too use and little ones can't figure it out.
-1	My 15 month old daughter was able to pull this thing apart with little effort. I would not recommend it.
+1	These locks took some time to install, however when you follow the instructions it goes very smoothly.  The time now was well worth the ease in the future.  Plus, after my daughter has outgrown the need for cabinet locks I can put them in their inactive mode.  This is great because when we have future company we can reactivate them and the home is childproof again.  Just be careful on cheap cabinets because you can drill through the entire door!  Definitely a wonderful investment.
+1	These locks just cannot be beat.  They were featured on HGTV to baby-proof your house which is how I found out about them in the first place.  They cannot be opened at ALL by the child, unlike many of the other items out there.  You have to not only have the key to open the door, you have to know how to manipulate it to open.  If you have chemicals that you have store within a child's reach, there is no other better way than this lock to make SURE that child is safe.  I feel very blessed that I found out these locks exist because my little one is extremely curious and figures out EVERYTHING! Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  Regarding the installation, my husband is not a handyman - he's a musician and if he can figure it out, so can just about anyone else.  Buy them!
+1	I read the directions twice then installed taking less than 15 minutes and I am pretty clueless with putting things together. One thing that should be changed is it says on the outside that a drill should be used but the directions says not to use a drill. The screws are small so a drill would be pointless. I like that it comes with paper guides so you only screww once and it is where it needs to be the first time instead of trial and error making many holes in cabinet.
+1	We have these locks installed on our cabinets in our home. I've tried other brands without success.. my kids always figure a way to get in. With this system, they can try all they want but they cannot get in. Sometimes the doors require pressing to open, but after I figured it out.. I never have an issue opening the doors. This will be the system of choice in any additional homes we buy later on... I don't think I'd ever want to change after having such a positive experience. I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member, without hesitation!
+1	As with everything about being a parent, locks are more complicated than you'd have thought (or would like!):SCREW-MOUNTED MAGNETIC LOCKS:  The Safety 1st Tot-Lok Locks can be difficult to install, especially on drawers, but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure.  Still, most people may want to try the adhesive locks (see below) first, to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly.Pros:+ Very nice & secure once installed, especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed.+ Works vertically or horizontally ... that is, on the side of a door or the top.+ Can easily be switched to hold the lock open, for when no children are aroundCons:- Complicated to install, especially in some situations.  So you might not get around to installing them, given all the other demands on your time.- Requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part, plus some small holes to attach- May require some new tools - a collar lock, to keep from drilling through the door; and a right angle chuck for tight spacesIf you plan to be in your home for a while, and want a finished, secure set of locks, the Tot Loks may be a good choice.One note, if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs.ADHESIVE MOUNT MAGNETIC LOCKS: The KidCo Adhesive Mount Magnet Locks will only work in some spots, but it's still a good lock to try first, for a lot of people, because it works well (in the right situations) and is easy to install.  Buy some and see how they work on your cabinets.  Once you've tried a few, it's a lot easier to see where'll they'll work or won't work.Pros:+ Quick to install, after a few minutes of figuring it out+ No drilling required, so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetsCons:- Only installs horizontally (along the top edge of a door or drawer), given the way they use gravity to lock.We just use the adhesive mount, no additional screws, for some furniture we didn't want to drill holes into.  They seem to be strong enough so far, especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while - if it won't open, they lose interest.  I don't know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling.HOOK LOCKS:  The advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type (like theMommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock) is that the hooks have a lot more play (they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock). So a child can bang them back and forth - they might not open the door or drawer, but they will make a racket.  Maybe OK in some situations, but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors.SLIDE LOCKS:  Slide locks (such as theAmerican Red Cross Cabinet Safety Slide Lock) are very quick and easy to install, if they fit.  But they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock, so if they are within reach they aren't much of a barrier to older kids.  And even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors.  However, they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel.FLEX LOCKS:  Flex locks (like the Safety First Cabinet Flex-Lock (see reviews) orCabinet Flex-Lock 2-Pack) are strong and easy to install, and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure (unlike the magnetic locks, which are designed to be out of sight).  So you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink; or use them when you travel.  And as a bonus, they are so secure that even some adults can't open them! ;-)  (They do take two hands to open.)  Not attractive, but they do the job if you keep them tightened.
+1	This product is great.  It's not super easy to install (each lock requires 6 screws plus one hole in the door).  If you take your time, ready the instructions, plan it out, and execute; it works great.  You have to be patient.  Each door took me 5 to 10 minutes.  In less than 1 hour I was able to unpack, read instructions, plan, get my tools, and have it done in 4 doors.  I think it won't work with hollow doors or maybe doors that are too thick but mine were pretty standard.I love how it's hidden and pretty sturdy due to having a bunch of screws holding it.  The adhesive ones are easy to install but I bet my son would open them in no time.
+1	After many years of fighting traditional cheap plastic child safety locks (we have a cat that likes to get into things too) and seeing our son still manage to pinch his fingers in doors (better than getting at chemicals or whatever, but still!), our pediatrician recommended these to us.  They were easy to install, and he can't get the doors open at all, so no pinched fingers or getting at something he shouldn't.  They also have a mechanism to keep the lock in the open position, like if you need to get in a cabinet a lot, or the kids are older and you don't need them anymore.  I would however recommend keeping an extra key around in case one gets lost, or locked in a cabinet by accident.
+1	These locks are fantastic, but wow, what a pain to install.  The directions are all but useless, so it was kind of trial and error.  My husband had to drill and redrill a couple of times to get the lock in the right place so that it would work.I would recommend these locks only for cabinets/drawers where there are dangerous/harmful goods inside.  It's worth it for those.
-1	This product is a great concept, BUT it has a critical flaw for me.  The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter.  I mean, why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers?  Hello?  Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed.  What about those holes?  It is cute that the manual says "do not drill through the door," hugh?  Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors?  Also, what happens if say the door cracks while I drill?  Who pays for that?  I know the answer to that one -> ME!  Soooo....product is going back.  Non-starter
+1	I am opening a home daycare and these are some of the only locks that are approved by the state of Washington. I really like the fact that they can be unlocked for long periods of time, so when I am working in the kitchen I can leave them unlocked and then quickly lock them again. They are really not hard to install, I watched a video on You Tube that showed how to install them and then went and did it.I am going to recommend these to people I know. I really think they would be great for grandparents or anyone who has young kids visiting often because you can turn them off when the kids are not there, most other child locks do not have that feature.
+1	I am sure we will use these in the future, but I wanted to post saying that our doctor recommended an emery board to avoid the risk of cutting the skin of a newborn because their nails are so close to it. Just wanted to let new moms know what I have learned.
-1	On the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off.  If I was not in a well lit room and paying close attention, my 7 week old could have gotten seriously hurt.  To add salt to the wound,  I tried to return the item and I got two separate emails from the seller.  The first email asked me to describe the defect.  I responded to the email. After which, I received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item; SERIOUSLY!  1. Do you think I am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it?  2.  If I described the defect as a sliver of metal, the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item, as a sliver denotes a very small piece, so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like.  3.  If the seller needed a picture, this should have been requested in the first email, not in a second email.  I shop online because I have limited time.  I do not have time to respond to an email trail for a $3 nail clip.  However, I am so irritated with the product and the seller's response that I decided to write this review.  In addition, my request to return the item was closed before the return approval process was completed!
+1	Ordered before baby was born. Now started to cut the nails already. Nice clippers, easy to hold in the hand.
+1	These aren't bad. A little awkward to use the clipper lever - it is very small even for my small hands and tends to slip. But I'm guessing this is just the case with all baby clippers. It's fairly easy to see what you're about to clip and you don't need to press very hard to cut the nail. My handle was green, unlike the white in the photo.
+1	Very nice it's was exactly what I expected. I will defiantly recommend it. I will be buying more in the future.
+1	So the baby nail clippers are TINY! and hard to hold, but this is great, it fits into the palm of my hand and I get my newborn son's nails clipped much easier. If I could, I would change the material on the grip to a rubbery texture so it wouldn't slide around in my hand at all. My hands are always very dry and it slides around a bit, but nothing like how those tiny ones fall out of my hand. I would recommend this product.
+1	I know they make these with a huge bulb on them now, but I still use the pairs of these I had from 10.5 years ago when my son was born.  I clip my 10 and 4 year olds' nails with these and they are steady and perfect and still clip fine.  Just bought a pair for a new mom-to-be friend, and have gifted them in the past.  These are all you need! And maybe some reading glasses and good light!
+1	These are comfortable to hold and make it easy to cut my baby's nails without cutting them too short or struggling to hold onto the tiny clippers.
+1	Honestly, I don't just use these for babies.  In fact, it's the nail clipper of choice in the house for all 9 of my kids.  They won't touch the metal ones, but these work really easy even for them to clip their own nails.  The only thing I would add to them is some type of metal file to clean under the nails... but you can't beat the ease of clipping with these things!
+1	This is baby nail clipper #4 that we've tried, and our search is finally over.  It's sharp enough to cut nails on the first try and the white bulb is pretty comfortable to hold.  What more do you need in a pair of baby nail clippers?The losers:- Safety 1st model 49539 (has the holder for emery boards) - the grip is comfortable but the clippers are blunt and therefore useless.  The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper (the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring) - has the safety guard so you don't catch the baby's skin in the clippers, but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail.  Plus, it's not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness, but something about the way it's designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby's nails.Search ends here, thank goodness!
+1	It is always difficult getting a reading from a thermometer for a sick infant. With this product, given that the infant would be used to a pacifer, works wonders. For all of my friends expecting a little one, this is a must.
-1	this thermometer is pretty consistent, but the nipple is too large for young babies. after my 2 month old gagged on this twice he started refusing his other pacifiers!
-1	My baby is two years old now and he loves his pacifiers. I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things... this was one of them. No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his (her) pacifier that he (she) loves and always uses. Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately, its too heavy. Especially if the baby is not feeling well. Don't buy this. Get a real thermometer.
+1	My Grandmother got this tub for my 3 month old son to use while visiting. It isn't as spacious as the tub we use at home, which is a little smaller than most tubs, but it folds up nicely, and it feels very safe and sturdy-not flimsy at all. I use both tubs in the big bathtub, so leaking isn't a problem for me. My son seems comfortable, but he prefers to have more water to splash in than this one holds. This tub is great for grandma's house, or if space is tight.
-1	I am sorry I bought this tub.  It is very uncomfortable for my daughter.  Used it since she was about 3 weeks old.  I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it's uncomfortable.  Also, there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain!  It's way too small.  She's now 4.5 mos and I'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it.  And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug -  it's an enormous effort to plug it each time.I've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger, nicer, more comfortable, and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes.
-1	I bought this tub before my son was born, thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink.  I do like that I can use it in the sink, but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds!  It doesn't hold much water, either.  I wish I had read reviews before I bought it, because now, after only 2 months, I'm just going to replace it and throw it away.  What a waste!
+1	I like this tub, it fits in my sink well, it folds up nicely. My daughter is 4 months old and still fits in it.
+1	I bought another tub initially - a friend told me about this one.  I will stick with this until my daughter outgrows it.  A must have.
+1	MY HUSBAND AND I LIKED THIS TUB BECAUSE WE COULD FOLD IT UP AND PUT IT AWAY IN THE LINEN CLOSET.  IT DOES TEND TO LEAK AT THE HINGES THOUGH CAUSING THE WATER TO GET COOL VERY QUICK.  WE USED TO KEEP THE WATER RUNNING INTO THE TUB THE ENTIRE TIME WE WERE BATHING OUR SON AND THIS WORKED OUT GREAT.  THE WATER WAS ALWAYS THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE AND OUR SON LOVED THE SPLASHING FROM THE FAUCET.  I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WITH LIMITED SPACE FOR AN INFANT TUB.
+1	I used this tub after borrowing from a friend because our Four Stage Bath System was so bad it was cutting up my baby's legs.  This was okay - soft all over, no problems like we had with the four stage, however because it folds the hinges tend to leak.  Also, you can't fill it to the level you would want because of the way its reclined.  The back is still very slippery despite the nonslip matt.  We only used for a few weeks before just bringing her in the tub with Mom and washing her that way.
+1	My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born.  We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she's 4 months old.  I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily.  It does leak at the hinges.  My daughter is very comfortable in it.  Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm.  It does fit in the kitchen sink though.  I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub.  It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher.  She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room. It is a great tub, and a great price!
-1	I got this as a shower gift. The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub. She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again. I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption. I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here. I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone. Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year.....
+1	I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year.  Living in an apartment, this tub is great for small spaces.  I use it in the big tub and when I am done, I just rinse it and leave it to dry.  When dried, I fold it and put it in the cabinet.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping.  But considering it folds for storage, that was not a big issue.  It's a great tub otherwise.
+1	I haven't had problems with this tub.... I used another tub for my son for the first 3 months, and that tub became too small, so I purchased this one.  I'm so glad I did.At 3 months, my son was large for his age, but unable to sit up yet, so this tub was perfect.I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with the other comments that it is not easily collapsible to store, and it is bulky, but we simply let it dry in the bathroom overnight and store it under his crib during the day - so space turned out to not be so much of a problem.I have had no issues with the tub leaking though.  Once it is completely extended, there is a good seal and it does not leak.I have and will continue to recommend this tub to all my friends.It's accomodating for longer than any tub out there.well worth the money.
-1	I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet. Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby. Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.
-1	I hate this tub!!! It leaks everywhere. I do not recommend buying this item
-1	I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it. I followed all the directions, I was very careful and patient with this tub, I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom. The design idea was good but it just isn't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly. The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring isn't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub. No matter how hard I work it's impossible to keep this tub clean.
-1	I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use.  My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue.  It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good, either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it.  I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead.  I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born.  It is very easy to put over my sink.  The green net comes with the tub is easy to use.
+1	Unfortunately, I am not able to find this bathtub anywhere (( My son used to have it 6-7 years ago). It is great! It is the only one bathtub where a baby does not slip forward and doesn't go under water. This blue gear is awesome. I do not understand why it is discontinued. I do not care if it is leaking. I did not notice that because it was used in adult bathtub. IF SOMEBODY HAS IT, PLEASE, I WILL BUY FROM YOU.
+1	I registered for this bath tub and recieved it as a shower gift. Everything on the tub works well. My son does slide down the sling and I do have to put him back. But I don't think it's possible for that not to happen because he's so actively moving the whole time. I've never had a problem with it leaking. The suction cups do get stuck on very hard and I really have to pull to get it up so much that I pulled one suction cup off last time(It went back on very easily). But theres a reason they stick so much to keep my son safe. So I am glad to have this tub and would recommend it over all the others.
-1	70% of the time, the tub doesn't leak. The 30% that it does leak, however, is a fiasco. Here's how it happens: Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are "clicked" into place (and yes, we did read the instructions) we fill the tub. Once we finish bathing her, we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain. It is at this point that by moving the tub, the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub, it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks....all over the hardwood floors. And let me tell you, it isn't easy to remedy this while holding a wet, squirmy baby. Mothers (and fathers) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess. My husband, an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal. Look at it! Meanwhile, we're shopping for a different type of tub. We cuss too much using this one.
-1	I registered for this and got it home and put it together. It didnt seem to fit together right. I took it back and bought a basic tub and a foam bear pad to lay her on. Much better. less $$ and easy to use.
-1	this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it, which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up.  couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily -  i gave myself more than one bruise (due to pinched skin) when trying to open and close it.  also, by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months, she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub, but rec'd this.  preferred the euortub by far!
-1	My son is now 11 months old and I have been using this tub since he was 5 weeks old.  In the beginning, we used the infant sling, but my baby would constantly slip down into the water.  We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping, but we still had to readjust him quite frequently.  When he learned to sit on his own, we tried using the bath seat feature.  He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring, thus painfully squishing his private parts.  We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him, but we managed.  Now he twists and turns and won't stay put in the tub.  I have thought about buying a better tub, but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub, I don't want to spend the money.  Please consider buying something different for your baby.  I will not be using this tub for my next child.
+1	Great product for our little one.  We put the baby tub in the big bath tub and our little one loves to take baths.  The first time we used it I had a hard time locking it but once I got it locked there were no problems.  I like the whole set up especially teh suction cups so it doesnt slide around, the sling to keep the baby laying on an incline is great too the perfect height to keep the baby happy.  It also has a removable bath ring, that she will be using when she can sit on her own.
-1	I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that's what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle "locking" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it's worth!
-1	I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great, BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock.  I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby doesn't have far to slide down.  Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we don't need the hammock.
+1	i was surprised to read all those negative reviews regarding this tub.  i had two different tubs before, and i got this one when my daughter was 5 months old, she's now one year old and still uses it.  granted, i never tried to fold it since those few inches don't seem to make much of a difference storagewise, so i don't know if its difficult to do.  i've had absolutetly no leaks with this tub, and the suction cups still work great.  the bathring works great, and can be moved out of the way when baby is old enough to sit alone.  although i still use the bathring so my daughter cant stand up all the time.  it's been 7  months with this tub, and nothing ever broke, or got worn.  i think this tub is great!!!
-1	DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS TUB. IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.MY BABY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS TUB, YOU ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE FREE HAND TO WASH THE BABY . IT ALSO LEAKS FROM THE BOTTOM
-1	This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used. It is impossible to get folded and unfolded. When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling. My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water. She is now to big for the sling, but to small to sit up in the ring. I gave it a fair try, but I had to go out and buy another bath. It seems like a great concept, but it is really just a waste of [money].
-1	this is the worst bath tub i've bought. i returned this item right away. it leaks. once i pulled it out to be longer but, no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together, it just wouldn't click. when i pressed it to lock the extension, i couldn't tell whether it locked or not, so then i put water to test the lock system. the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.now, i bought the Euro bath. it does a good job.
+1	We bought 2 of these, and used them to block off the computer desk from the rest of the family room, and to block off the 7' wide archway between the kitchen and the rest of the house. We soon found that while these are very sturdy and adaptable, they are tall enough that they are a hassle to step over. At least once a week, my husband or I will catch a toe or scrape a shin stepping over. So if you intend to use this fence as a corral, either indoors or out, this is a Great Buy. If you are planning to use it as a fence to block off a wide opening, pay the extra money for the metal version with the gate. you (and your toes) will be much happier.
+1	We bought this play area to keep our 15 month old daughter safe while we worked outside.  She loves it and plays well.  It is easy to set up and tear down and takes a matter of seconds.  Best of all, is that it is very light and easy to carry, as well as having an excellent carry strap.
+1	This product is a godsend!  I use it on a carpeted area for our 7 month old infant, so she can crawl around to her hearts content and be safe from wall outlets, small objects, etc.  I am also planning on getting an extension, to make her play area even bigger.  The 'Superyard XT' is also great for puppies, and more humane than crating them for hours.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the gate that opens (so you can get in the 'Superyard') is awkward and somewhat difficult to work.  There should be an easier swing open type gate on this thing, so that mommy or daddy can quickly enter and leave the play area.
+1	I recently purchased this yard when my twins ((now nearly 8 months old)) started to become mobile.I have yet to baby-gate my entire house, but I have super-yard'ed the family room! I have it shaped as a square, and have those alphabet puzzle peice foam squares inside, to protect my carpet. The boys enjoy being able to actually see through the holes, and be able to play with many of their toys ((rather than being confined in a pack n play)). It is pretty sturdy if used properly, I mean if I or any other adult were to fall on it, obviously it would collapse. It DOES fold, but not at all compactly, and I would say that it would most-likely take up my entire mini-van trunk if I were to travel with it... so if you are looking for a compact on-the-go type of play-yard, look else-where. I do like that you can configure it to fit an oddly-shaped play area, or even remove/add panels ((sold separately which we did not buy)) to make it larger or smaller. Also, due to it being plastic ((very well rounded I may add, no sharp edges!)) we will be able to start bringing it outdoors as well now that the weather is improving!I also am planning on purchasing another one to use to "gate off" 2 over-sized entrance ways to my family room. My husband believes if we screw 3 hooks ((with the full hole, not the 1/2 hole) to either side of each door frame, and then attatch those strong zip-ties to the hooks and the holes in the gate, that it will work. Of course, this will do damage to our walls, but it is the only solution I see fit with such a large doorway ((please note that these are NOT meant for stairs, or doorways. They are NOT baby gates... this is just a creative suggestion I thought I would mention)). And, one of my friends owns one, and used it to surround her christmas tree last year, which I thought was an AMAZING idea!I think that once our boys master crawling, and eventually walking that the super-yard will prove even more valuable than it is now!
+1	This is one of only a few products my husband and I would buy again with no hesitation.  We bought it over a year ago (with the extension) and have used it every day since.  When my daughter outgrew the octoganal arrangement, we just opened it up and have used it to block her from the kitchen and other dangerous areas.  She is not a climber yet, so I do NOT recommend using it in this fashion if your child is.  It will tip over, the circular formation is the sturdiest.  We haven't had any problems with pieces breaking off or the plastic being brittle and we adjust it almost daily.  Highly recommended.
+1	We bought 3 sets... family is buying them also.  Great idea for when you have to keep the little ones in a safe space, our twins love being and playing in it
+1	We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. This is our experience. Your mileage may vary.Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! (&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. So far it's not too much of a problem. The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. The major downside is the price. Ack.
+1	We love this thing.  I read the reviews before I bought it and thought it would be tough to &quot;unravel&quot; but it wasn't bad at all.  I expect a new product not to just pop right into position, but it formed a hexagon rather easily.  That's the key---no assembly required!  My daughter is 7 months old and when she pushes herself up on her front arms and tips over onto her back, she occasionally bonks her head on the &quot;wall&quot; of the pen.  She gave herself a nice red spot on her head when she hit the &quot;hinge joint&quot; part of the pen that concerned me, but it wouldn't be very effective if it wasn't sturdy.  The mesh lattice walls seem to have a little give in them.  To remedy it as best as I could, I have placed stuffed animals or larger toys in front of the corners.  I still think that her rare head bonks are a good trade off for other huge catastrophies that would be occuring daily in or house.  She doesn't protest to being put in it because she has a sense of freedom and scoots all around and is still be able to see us.  And we can keep an eye her as well.  It is the perfect size as not to intrude on living room space but big enough to hold her ever-growing little body and a ton of her toys.  We bought a second one for upstairs and we're going to try to connect them together for outdoor occasions.
+1	It did exactly what I purchased it for.  My baby never actually stayed in the enclosed area (absolutely hated it!) but I was able to use it for other purposes which was great, such as enclosing the fireplace.  The floor stickers, or whatever they're called, to keep it in place left sticky residue on my hardwood floors which took some effort to remove though.
+1	My son is getting around pretty good now and I wanted to be able to contain him a little.  I put this with the extension kit around his Laugh and Learning Home by Fisher Price and he is able to play while I get a few chores done.  It is open enough that he does not feel too confined and seems quite content to play in it for a while.  A good purchase that can be used in multiple ways.
+1	Welcome to the toddling/scootching/crawling years, where you can't ever get a break unless you have some way of keeping junior from getting away.The SuperYard is a foldable rigid-plastic fencing system for creating what we called back in the day a play pen. It's designed to be reconfigurable for a given area, so that the enclosure can be made to fit odd spaces. It works for indoor and outdoor areas, and the optional extensions can be used to make rather large enclosures quite easily.We bought this as a replacement for the Pack-N-Play type portable play yard. Our son, at 10 months or so, had clearly outgrown this smaller type yard, and was quite unhappy at the limiting horizons of its opaque blue walls. The SuperYard has been a very good, albeit not completely perfect, solution for providing some portable play space that requires somewhat lighter supervision than a freeplay in an open room. Our son's now closing in on 14 months and this has been useful for that purpose.It's not 100% easy to set up and reconfigure, and there's a reason for that. The extra difficulty with piecing the "end" sections together means it's nearly impossible for a tot to open or close this by their lonesomes. It takes some strength and adult wile to open the sections and bend the connectors at various angles to thus reconfigure the overall shape. There's a slight trick to negotiating the opening mechanism in a panel, but once you "get it", it's easy enough. I suspect many of the comments about difficulty of set-up were written by those who had just set the thing up for the first time or who don't move it around a lot and who have forgotten "the trick". We're on our fourth month of using ours, and it's very easy now to open and close the corral, as we call it (perhaps in part because we do it frequently).One of the big advantages of this type of arrangement is the shape of the enclosure can be changed. I think some of the comments about this being unstable are either from those who are unrealistically expecting a completely rigid structure, or those who may have assembled it in a way that the shape is unstable. If you put a 120 degree angle at each of "joints" and form at least a hexagon (with the basic model) or an octagon (with the model plus one extension), you get an incredibly stable structure. I can demonstrate this by putting my full 200+ lb weight on the edge when it's open, in which case there's considerable flex, versus when it's closed in an octagon shape, in which case it barely gives and I can practically do a push-up on it.Of course the whole thing can slide -- it's made out of plastic and it's not attached to anything! Your little bruiser may be able to push it around a bit, but your average baby isn't going to get very far. If the structure is set up in a way that it's got some sort of limiter (a wall, for instance) keeping it from moving too far, this really ought not be a problem. The idea is for creating a play yard you can set up easily an in a variety of places, and anything that's fixed permanently is not going to serve that purpose. That's your trade-off with this type of yard versus a smaller crib or similar yard.The expectation for this should be as a semi-temporary safe play area. I would recommend it for creating a "safe" play zone in an otherwise unsafe area -- an unchild-proofed room or outside (where we use it from time to time). It is not to create an undersupervised area, except perhaps for  a quick deposit of your tot while you go to the bathroom or answer the door, etcetera.  We use this in the room that has our computer -- despite our attempts to childproof this area, it's pretty impossible given the requirements of computer cabling. The SuperYard has at least made a part of this room safe enough.As for being able to climb over it -- there may be some prodigious children who can scale this using the lattice work as foot-rests, but I strongly suspect they can scale other things as well. Our little guy can pull up on the frame, and it occasionally slips a few inches, but I don't know a lot of toddlers coordinated enough to know how to climb a fence AND who have small enough feet to use the rather small lattice openings. (If you want to be extra sure, just put the kid in some shoes, which will make it impossible to use his toes to grab the lattice holes.)I do recommend getting at least one extension, as the extra two panels nearly double the available surface area options, and if you don't need them you can literally just fold them over without having to detach them.The portability has been excellent -- once you get the knack of how much pressure you need to collapse the sections, it folds up like an accordion, and there's a carrying strap that doubles as a restraining strap to keep the folds together while under transport. Folded up, it takes up about as much space as the smaller Pack N Play but at about half the weight.Where this has been less than ideal has more to do with our kid than the product. He doesn't like being left alone in it, but neither does he like being left alone in any of his other confinements (e.g. crib). The fact that he can see out the SuperYard is a big help; with the old Graco PackNPlay, the opaque sides meant he couldn't see a parent even if quite close. So while he objects to being set down alone, a little distraction with a forgotten toy and the reassurance of being able to see the parent through the "wall" usually suffices to make us both happy.
+1	We bought this play yard when our son was 2 months old and we LOVE it!  It keeps his toys, books, blankets, etc. in a clean space away from our curious doggies.  It's a great, roomy size and not too hard to put together or take down.  It can be configured into different shapes and easily moved.
+1	I recieved this as a shower gift and began using it when my daughter began to crawl.  It was better than any play yard because there is much more room for toys and for baby.  As she grew (and the number of toys as well), I purchased an extension to make the area bigger.  It was great for both indoor and outdoor use.  We also used it to block the large open area between our kitchen and family room that no other gate would be large enough to cover.  Now that winter is here and she is running about, we are using it to block our wood(pellet) stove to prevent any accidents.  We also plan on using it around our Christmas tree again this year. Other reviews have complained that it is not sturdy or difficult to set up.  I have never had a problem and it folds up and stores easily.  Well worth it for it's versatility.
+1	This gate is an indispensable thing in our household. We have twins and it seems to keep our kiddos as well as all their stuff in one place. They can't stay in here for too long, but it's great for when we need to cook and can't have them by our side. This is the best gate!!
+1	I wish there was a volume adjuster because it is a little louder than I imagined and that the music would last a little longer.
+1	Our 11 month old really loves this toy, he loves swatting the sides to make the music turn off/on. Its very sturdy and well made, but the one we received stopped working for no apparent reason after about 2 weeks. Amazon quickly replaced it and so far all is well with the second toy, though we've only had it a few days.
-1	Who is very chatty and outgoing. He's five months old now. It startles him and made him cry a few times. Decided it was a bit too 'manic' for him. Maybe when he's a bit older.
+1	My daughter isn't quite a year old, and she can control this toy.  It's easy to press the buttons, and she loves the music.  I think this is a great buy!
-1	This thing as so loud and piercing. My son doesn't really care for it. It's heavy for a baby to hold and doesn't really do much.
+1	My 15 month old still enjoys this toy after getting it for Christmas when she was near 9 months. She didn't quite get it at first since she was so young, but through the months she's enjoyed pushing the buttons, watching the lights go on and off, hearing the music, and now at 15 months knowing that the different buttons do different things. My only complain is that there are a couple of songs that get old quickly, but I guess that comes with every music making toy! I like that it's colorful and the education it provides with the instruments (mommy and daddy are crazy music lovers) as well as the simplicity of the toy. Hopefully she'll enjoy it for a few more months!
+1	It's a bit on the loud side, yes, but my baby loves this toy.  She smacks it, turns it around, bites the corners.  It has kept her entertained for several minutes at a time, which is a lot for my very squirmy, active little one.  Very happy with it!
+1	I bought this for my 4-month old son. He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it. The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra. The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby's musical skills.Cons: The battery didn't last long. We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!
-1	We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new "upgraded" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The "music" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again.
+1	Bought this as a gift because we love the one we own! By far the least annoying music making baby toy. We received a used one as gift when my daughter was 9 months and it has held up great over the years. Both of my kids love it too.
+1	We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old.  At first, he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music.  But as he got older, he learned how to play with it more.  He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones.  He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear.  I love that he loves this toy!
+1	We like this toy.  The corners are very soft and it is very easy for a baby to turn on and off. He loves moving it around the room.  A few of the sounds could be improved. But I would buy this for a friend.
+1	Has 8 recognizable tunes and easy enough for our 9 month old to figure out. Nice silicone-esque edging makes it easy to grip and keeps from sliding.
+1	I love this toy, and so does my 13 month old son.  He got it for his birthday, and he plays with it every day.  So far, we have had no trouble with it, and the batteries haven't even needed to be changed yet!  At first, he would just roll it to the orchestra side and hit that until it started playing.  Then he  learned that if he hit it again, the song would change.  So now he plays one song after another.  Lately, he has also started experimenting with the different instruments, both alone and together.  He plays with it for hours.  I don't get tired of hearing it either, because there are several different songs, and the sound quality is not irritating.  It's electronic, but much more pleasant than many of his other music toys.  Also, the tones of the instruments fluctuate a little bit, which makes it sound more like real instruments than electronic tones.Long story short, this has stood up to ALOT of play already, and we like it just as much now as we did when we first got it.
+1	I don't know what the "old" magic cube is that some reviews have mentioned, and yes it's true that the instrument sounds are electronic-sounding reproductions not actual instrument sounds.  I hesitated to purchase this after watching a video review on here showing the violin sound.  I have played piano for 26 years and violin for 23 so I might be pickier than some as  far as the sound.  I'm so glad I got it despite the negative reviews and it doesn't bother me that the sounds aren't completely authentic.  (I'd also like to note that the violin is the worst sounding one, the other instruments sound more like the real thing in my opinion.)  I love that you can hear each instrument's part separately and choose which instruments you would like to play together.  My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys, and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he's doing to start another song then go back to playing.  As he gets older it will be neat to show him that while each instrument plays similar but different parts, they all go together to make a pretty song.The toy seems very sturdy, although after several months of play the 'harp' button has to be pushed a little harder than the others for some reason.
-1	The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months, but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same.  How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments?  I guess they don't have actual instruments in China.
+1	I bought this for my 3-year old daughter as one of her Christmas present from Santa Claus, she is not that into it, I think this is best for kids age 6 months to 2 years. I was going to buy it on Amazon, happened to find it elsewhere for just a little over $20.
+1	Hands-down one of the best purchases we made.  My son fell in love with this around age 6 months and still plays with it at 1 1/2.  The music is lovely and it teaches kids cause and effect, and then how to combine melodies.  A really fantastic gift.
+1	My 9 month old son LOVES this toy!  It's not too loud and lights up with pretty colors.  He goes back to it time and time again but never gets tired of it.  I highly recommend it!
+1	The Mozart magic cube is an AWESOME toy for my busy little 15 month old boy.  It's one of the VERY few toys he will stop and play with.  He has always loved music from a young age.  He like to hit the various buttons and it is small enough for him to carry around.  It also can take lots of abuse.  My 4 year old daughter will play with it as well.  Really a classic must have for babies and toddlers.
+1	Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube.Nice music, interesting concept (one instrument per side). Baby (7 months old ) loves it. Good quality.
+1	This toy inspires me. I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound. Now he gets the full functionality of the toy. It lasts for years, offering various entertainments to various ages of kids. Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones, so we love this. Warning, it's very heavy. Don't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma's (we learned this lesson). The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety. We're never giving away this adorable musical toy.
+1	The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend's daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, "GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!"Love it!
+1	This item has been a life saver for me!  Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices.
+1	Our 8 month old loves to &#34;bang&#34; things so this is perfect. He moves it around, bangs on it and lights it up with music. Great buy!
+1	Love, love, love this cube. My 8 month young daughter loves it too. It never gets old and it's so much fun to hit all the different instruments, then listen to them all play in sync. Great buy!!
+1	I must say I'm guilty of purchasing anything that has &#34;Mozart&#34; in the name, since I love classical music and Mozart is my favorite composer. But this is the best toy ever. When I bought it my baby was a newborn, so mostly I played with it. But now my baby is seven months old and absolutely adores it. Whenever he is fussy, I just give him the cube and he forgets his fussiness at once. Best toy ever!
+1	This is a great musical toy.  I think it's very well made and should last a long time.  It's been dropped dozens of times and it keeps on playing like new :o)
+1	My 13 month old son loves playing with this. He enjoys switching up songs.2 complaints, 1)its pretty heavy 2)all the instruments sound very electronic
+1	This is a great toy.  My 7 month old daughter loves it and so do many of my musician friends.  There is one significant flaw in its design; this is that the volume is not adjustable and it is too loud.  If it were 1/2 this loud, I'd let me daughter play with it all the time.  As it is, I usually limit her to playing with it with me, so I can hold it away from her head/ears.Due to the too loud volume, I'm giving it a 4 star review, instead of 5.  Otherwise, it is a great, great product.
-1	My children (an infant and a preschooler) like this toy--but it is WAY too loud. I wish there was a way to turn the volume down. I'd return this if I purchased it at a store, but it's too much of a hassle to return this to amazon. So sad.
+1	My little one loves this toy (and my nephew loved his many years ago too).  It's easy to turn instruments on and off herself, and she loves hearing the different instruments (and combination of instruments) play the same tune.
+1	I bought this for my 19 month old son based upon the reviews of others. Well, the reviews were right -- this is a great toy. The music is great, the sound quality is surprisingly good, and the ability to add/remove instruments from each piece being played is very clever. In addition, it seems to be well made, with rubber bumpers on the corners. My son loves this thing, and becomes very involved when playing with it every time he uses it. Highly recommended.
+1	All the grand kids loved it and do the parents. It's a great gift for years. Durable and practice, a must.
-1	So, first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them (but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes. To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once, which I find annoying. Overall my LO doesn't seem too interested in it just yet.
+1	Santa gave this to our 6 month son for Christmas.  Both he and my 2 year old LOVE it.  It is wonderfully sturdy, and has many music functions.  My 2 yr old will announce each instrument as she adds them into the melody.  My husband is a music educator, and he gives this a big thumbs up!  Thank you Santa!  Would buy again and again.
-1	Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube
+1	This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild.  She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.This is an excellent choice for a baby gift.
+1	I was a little skeptical at first.  But this cube is a lot of fun! There are instruments on each side that can be turned on and off while contributing to the main song.  You can have a piano solo, and then add other instruments on top.  Well built cube, should last a long time!
+1	My daughter loves this toy. She'll sit with her books and press the on the box for the pleasant tunes. My husband and I really enjoy the music. It's ten times better than the average music played by other baby toys.
+1	I think a lot of kids these days have this toy. It's quite popular. All my friends with babies have it.It's a toy providing light entertainment.I'm a trained musician and I disagree with some reviews saying that the quality of the sound is poor. Trust me, for a toy it's totally fine. You can still tell the instruments apart. You can't expect your baby to become a little Mozart just by listening to this cube 5 minutes a day anyway.Everything seems to function well. It's safe. I'm not scared to turn away for 30 seconds. I know that there are no sharp edges and my baby won't hurt herself.I'm not sure this toy carries a lot of educational / developmental value but it's nice.
+1	This toy definitely keeps my 7 month old entertained. The flashing lights are very attractive. Though I have to say, the sound quality is just so-so, but at least there is enough sounds/songs on there that it does not repeat very often and becomes annoying, so that's all that matters. I have to say the toy itself is a bit heavy. My son likes to grab hold of it while rolling around and sometimes he drops it on himself and cry...
+1	My 4 year old son spotted this toy while we were out shopping for my 4 month old daughter. He couldn't help but play with this in the store and I thought that since my baby loves music so much she would probably enjoy this. I was a little put off by the price. (I paid a bit more than it is here) but it was worth it! My daughter was totally fascinated by the flashing lights and music and I even found myself and my son playing with it together! I'm sure as she gets older, she will really enjoy how interactive it is. Such a cool toy. And the best part? Unlike many other toys that make noise, this one is not annoying at all! The instruments sound so realistic that it's enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this and will probably give as a baby gift in the future.
+1	seems simple, but both my 6 month old and 3 year old enjoy playing with this toy. the sounds are also pleasant and not as annoying as most musical kids toys.
+1	My daughter loves it and I love it too.Its a fun fun fun musical toy!!!Well built toy!!! The edges are carefully covered with smooth soft plastic. awesome buy!
+1	This is one of my son's favorite toys. He's been watching/listening to it since he was born. Now that he's 5 months old, he's still very interested in it. Currently likes to kick the buttons with his feet and loves the music (as do I). This is a toy that will provide entertainment for months to come!
+1	I purchased this toy for Christmas for my daughter who was 10 months old at the time and she loved it right away. She happily tapped on the large buttons to hear each instrument and stayed engaged for at least half an hour each time she played with it. Now at almost 16 months old, she has figured out how to play with it more, understanding that she can change the melody to each song and is just starting to realize with true understanding that she can add/remove an instrument to change the song to her liking. I find myself playing with this toy, as do many of my daughter's young playmates and their parents too! Some of her older cousins, who are 7-9yrs old also find enjoyment playing with this toy as well and this just proves the endless possibilities this toy provides as well as many years of extended play. So far, this toy has been dropped quite a bit and it still looks/functions as new as the day I purchased it.I'm also aware that this toy is what many have called a cheaper reproduction of the original that was out many years ago, but the product I received is pretty good too. The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is very engaging and while others have said the music sounds &#34;tinny&#34;, I didn't find that to be the case at all. I'm no music expert, but to my ears, each of the instrumental sounds is clear and pretty to me! I'm sure the original was really great but this one is pretty nice too. I suspect that maybe I received a newer model and the quality has been improved and if that's the case, I HIGHLY recommend the purchase of this toy. The instruments sound lovely, the songs are pleasant and will not annoy you as other toys do, and most of all, this toy is educational because it engages children to think and can be enjoyed for many, many years to come!
+1	My 9 month old has loved this toy for several months. He always grabs it first in a pile of toys and loves the music. It's great for adults too because it's classic tunes, not annoying like some of our other toys. This is in the top 3 toys of all time in our house and that's saying something.
+1	Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months. He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him. He now plays it himself (13 months). I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery. It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around.
+1	I bought this when my baby was less than a year old. He loved it. While it is not the highest quality music, this is a toy that was meant for children and they seem to really enjoy using it. It is easy for their uncoordinated hands to use and interesting enough that they continue to explore it. It has bright lights and different musical instruments to select from or to blend together.
+1	baby got this at 3 monhs and still loves it after a year, so many ways to play with it and the sound is really fine! great buy, andone which travels with baby easily
+1	I really like this magic cube. Our toddler plays and dances to it a lot. The sounds it produces are really sharp and the music is great. We enjoy it.
+1	Our little one loves this toy and plays with it over and over again, starting at 4 months and still now (6.5 months).  I'm sure he doesn't grasp the concept of it yet, but the lights and music hold his interest.
+1	My five month old loves this product. She uses it to support herself while sitting up and explores the buttons with complete concentration. Considering most toys only hold her interest for 5-10 minutes, the 15-20 she gets out of this speaks for itself. The sounds of the instruments is artificial and tinny, but not so much so that I can't stand to hear it. My only complaint is that it is quite loud, I wish it came with the ability to adjust the volume. Recommended.
-1	Borning toy and my son was over it the minute he opened it up. Music is nice but the buttons are hard to press for a child so be ready to sit there doing it for them. Given the age that a kid outgrows this, you won't have much use for this very long.
+1	Based on the myriad of reviews here, I purchased this toy when my triplets were several months old.  To be honest, they did not care for or notice it until they were closer to 8 or 9 months.  At that point, they realized they could start and stop the music by hitting at it.  All of a sudden, they took great interest in it.  It was also excellent when they were just learning to sit unassisted.  They could lean forward and balance on the cube while playing at the same time.Now that they have "figured" it out, the toy is a little less appealing.  I am waiting for the next enjoyment phase to kick in when they start noticing and playing with the different instruments.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that battery life is shorter than I would have expected.  While not bad, it seems to slow down more quickly than our other battery operated toys.
+1	My 8 month old isn't too impressed with it.  It is nice and well made but just not for my kiddo.Personally I like the different instruments that play the songs.  Hopefully when he gets older he will appreciate it more.
+1	bought this as a replacement for my son's first potty seat, this one is much better. not as padded, which means it won't rip open and harbor a bunch of bacteria. my son's old one used to collect urine underneat of it in the plastic part, this one doesn't at all, it's perfect
-1	We have an elongated toilet and I don't know of anyway to hold this seat in place. My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back, the whole seat goes with her. So when she pees, it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess.
+1	Seat comes off the plastic handle-and-holder. Colors are nice and seat is soft and easy to clean. It is light and my 18-month-old can lift and place it (albeit not always with the right fit) on the toilet seat. Guard is useless in my mind since my LO can't climb over it, but otherwise a steal and saved me the trouble of getting a potty.
+1	It fits the toilet seat very well. It doesn't slide from side to side. Easy to use,it's light. Made in USA.
+1	I transitioned my daughter from the potty to the regular toilet.  I wanted something that would draw her attention to make her want to sit on it and this seat did it.  Day1 I thought she would be scared but she said &#34;Dora&#34;!  And sat on it with no fight.  Great seat!
+1	I bought this from the wish list of a homeless shelter where I live. They have a number of children living there and I imagine many of them potty train while they are staying there. I know how much my nieces and nephews love Dora so I thought this would get used more than a plain potty seat.
-1	My daughter liked the seat she had (Primo Ducka) but really wanted a seat with handles for pooping. This little seat seemed to fit the bill and was cheap enough that I didn't mind buying another seat.Yes, it "fits" elongated toilets. But there is nothing to keep it from sliding around on the longer toilet seat underneath it - no clamps, no pegs, no rubber feet, nothing! Every time my daughter tried to sit down, the seat would slide 4 inches backwards - landing her on the pee guard. If I start with the little seat as far back as possible, it's too far for her to get on without help (she's nearly 3!) and once on, her feet don't touch her fairly tall step stool. It needs to be at the front of the toilet seat but it won't stay there. So I have to be with her to hold it in place so she can climb on. Not a problem if you are starting out - you need to be with your child - but this is a problem if your child knows how to use the potty and wants to express her independence and "do it herself".Once she is sitting with the seat in the proper place, the biggest complaint starts. This thing collects pee. The little pee guard is pointless. From what I've seen pee guards are needed by some kids, not by others - regardless of sex. My daughter needs one - a decent one. This one just deflects her pee all over the seat, the floor, her pants, her shoes. In short, a drippy, nasty mess that has to be cleaned every time it is used with extra laundry. I shudder to think of the muck that is accumulating in the foam under the vinyl.She wanted one with handles. Fine. I've added two simple drawer pull knobs to our Primo Ducka potty seat. She's pleased. This piece of junk went in the trash.
-1	Not good quality and didn't fit my toilet. I suppose its ok as a travel one if you need that.
+1	Another child to potty train and anything they are into to get them to go is where I head and this seems to do the trick. It holds up well and she seems to enjoy seeing Dora.
+1	I just started potty training my two year old son and I found the Thomas potty seat to be a great incentive. The seat is cushioned so it's nice and comfortable and it fits nicely on most seats. It's also compact enough to fit in the diaper bag if you want to take it on the go. For boys, it does come with a splash guard. The padded part of the seat lifts up and it gets inserted between the plastic and padding. It stays in place most of the time, but it is easy to misplace. I would have preferred it to be permanently attached, but aside from that I am happy with this purchase.
-1	A sticker on the packaging clearly stated that the potty material includes a known cancer causing agent. I sent it back to Amazon immediately. My daughter was very disappointed because she loves Dora!
+1	What can I say about a potty seat. It fits, his butt fits it, he likes the characters on it, it's easy to clean. Buy it.
+1	I ordered this product because it was advertised to have a built-in splash shield, which many don't. I specifically researched and looked for one with that for my little girl. It says it has one and the picture shows it. However, the actual product does not have one. I opened the package, thinking it might be inside the wrapping,but no, it wasn't. Now, I'm out $15 and still have to look for another one.Two days later: I am adding this note on and raising my rating from one star to four stars. After I wrote the above review, amazon contacted me within 24 hours and offered me a refund, even if I wanted to keep the item. I was so surprised by the generosity of that offer. Amazon once again has proved itself excellent in customer satisfaction and really checked the reviews to see if they could make the situation better. I really appreciate that and love amazon all the more for it. Thank you, amazon.
+1	I know the dimensions are listed, but for some reason I was surprised at how big/long the caterpillar is.  Because it is not like a big stuffed animal (long and thin) it was very easy for my 4 month old to hug and hold.  He can easily pull it to his mouth to bite on it.  He's almost 6 months now and can focus on one area or another...it is still big for him.  So I can see how for the next few months, he'll still be interested because it is big and he can do more and more with it.  my 2 year old niece visited and latched onto it and began imagination play.
+1	My child loves this toy so if it is good for them it is definitely worth 5 stars. On amazon the price is right as well.
+1	This gate was a replacement for the crappy Swing 'N Lock.  This gate is so easy to install.  The only problem was we have baseboards and couldn't use the template.  SO I simply measure 3 inches off the floor and then marked the holes to drill and folded the template to get the upper holes marked.  We did however have a lot of wall damage due to the fact that this was installed on the metal corner protectors under the drywall and a lot of the joint compound fell off due to disturbing it.  I will not fix it now since I'm sure I'll have more to fix later.  I like this gate because it has two point of contact in the locked and closed position.  Both rails the upper and lower fit about 1 1/2 inch into a metal seat.  This makes it so secure.  I don't agree w/ the other reviewers that said the lower rail pops out, I'm sure if it was installed WRONG.  Just make sure to measure properly and make sure things are even, level and line up and there is NO way the rail is going to pop out!  I did pinch myself a few times opening this the first few times.  You have to slide the rail in a bit to swing it and there's a metal piece on the top rail that supports the two gates, ouch.  Will remember not to do that!
+1	This gate could have easily been 5 stars, but there are a few points that need mention, where the gate needs some improvement.  If 'Evenflo' addresses these, this gate will easily merit a top score.  Let me start with the positives.  The gate itself is made of sturdy and aesthetically appealing wood.  It works well and looks great, IF the install goes well, and as EXACTLY specified (included paper template is great).  The mechanical 'lock latch' inspires confidence in that you can actually feel and hear it 'click into place', which gives one peace of mind.  Of course, one hopes that 'Evenflo' has determined this type of latch to be one that is not 'easily defeated' by the age group that it was manufactured/intended for (6 months to 2 years)!  Thankfully, it does seem like it is up to the task.  I also like the fact that the bottom latch receptacle allows for the gate to slide into, thus adding reinforcement to BOTH the top and bottom portions of this gate.  Way to go 'Evenflo'!  The negatives about the gate are as follows. In many typical installations, there will be baseboard molding/trim that may get in the way of installing the bottom-most latch receptacle. It did in my case, even after carefully measuring the proper clearance from the floor, as specified in the assembly directions.  Thus, I wasn't able to get the latch receptacle to clear the molding in order to screw in the bottom screw.  I had to thus cut (with a hacksaw) that portion of the latch receptacle, and 'modify' it for my installation.  I then was only able to use 1 screw (although a larger and longer one than provided), instead of 2, to install the bottom latch receptacle.  Thankfully, even just the modified 1 screw installation was very tight and secure going into the door jam wood.  'Evenflo' should provide the consumer with at least another type of bottom latch receptacle that allows for better clearance of molding near the floor.  Besides, MOST typical homes DO have some kind of baseboard molding, and mine was only 1/1/2" high, hardly anything large.  Lastly, the assembly directions did not make clear which latch receptacle to use on the top, and which on the bottom.  They are NOT the same dimensions, as one is thicker than the other (top latch receptacle is thinner than the thicker bottom one).  Of course, the aforementioned 'latch receptacle' install challenge may not even apply to you for your installation, especially if you don't have floor baseboard molding.  In summation, this gate is STURDY and EXCELLENT, and a good value.  PLEASE, just make sure you do install it correctly (as per the instructions), and NEVER leave your baby alone unsupervised.  These gates are meant to be used WITH proper supervision, and never as a replacement for.
+1	We have this gate at the entry to the hallway, which is at an angle.  It keeps our 100 lb dog out of the cat litter, and it will keep our 6 mo old boy out, too, once he can crawl and walk.  It was easy to install, and it serves it's purpose perfectly!
+1	I have four different gates in my house, and this, by far, is the most secure and stable. Therefore, it's at the top of my stairs... the most important place. I feel like I could even sit on that gate, and it's no going to budge.When we have guests over, they have trouble opening it, because you have to squeeze really hard, but I like that I have to squeeze really hard... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day.
-1	I hate this gate and quality is typical of evenflo. If I had noticed it was evenflo, I wouuld not have wasted my time. It was a pain to install. Total PAIN. Then, when it's unlocked, it slides for adjustment. The thing is, there is no way to stop it so baby sticks his arm through slates as you open and then you have a broken or badly bruised arm. We put a screw into the wood so it would slide just a little to help prevent that. IF we had known about the second risk, we would have just taken it down then. THe next morning, it was kid tested. Yeah, all the kid has to do is push the bottom and it comes out of the bracket causing the gate bend foreward. So far, I have seen my kids push it more than a foot out of position. MAJOR STRANGLATION HAZARD. Not to mention broken bones. The wood is so flimsy it just twist every which way.As far as function goes, when you go to unlock it, sometimes it will not unhook out of the slot. I have had to pratically hang on it to get it open. Also, the gate now leans. When opened, it leans to where a ball would roll for the from to the end of the gate. Not sure how that came about. We have had this gate for a couple of months. My son has been able to push it out since he started crawling. My 2 yrold can almost squeeze out by pushing on it which has lead to her getting stuck when I made a bathroom break. Not a good gate at all. Evenflo just needs to stop. Every product I have had has been crap. I am afraid to buy their carseats. If they can't make a good simple baby gate, I wouldn't trust my child's life to their carseats. We plan to replace within the next couple of paychecks.
+1	We love this gate!  We purchased two, one for the top of the stairs and one for downstairs.  Let me tell you a few reasons why this will be the only baby gate we will buy.1.  You can take the gate part off when not needed, yet it is safe enough for the top of the stairs.2.  Even 5 year olds still cannot open it.  All other baby gates become useless as soon as the kids figure out how it works.3.  You can buy extra sets of hardware to move the gate around depending on the circumstances.4.  It's so cheap!These are just the top few reasons why we love this gate.  Give it a try.
-1	Update: 6-months later - the sliding mechanism has loosened up considerably with use.  It now slides smoothly without pinching our hands.  I've found the gate to be strong and secure - it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it.  So, if you buy it, try rubbing some wax, or something, on it to help in the beginning, because it was pretty dangerous at first.  And also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you're opening it. That will happen with any slotted, sliding gate.  Some further negatives I found is that the latch is loud, and it's also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands.  And with it being difficult for her to do, she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying.  I'm always afraid she's going to wake the kids.  So, if you have your mom at your house a lot, get something easier.  It will save a lot of frustration - for both of you!-----I've had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it.  What happens is when you unlatch it, you first have to slide the gate in, then swing it out.  There are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together, and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract (look at the photo - you'll see what I mean).  The sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do.  I'm sure with use it will loosen, or perhaps I can put some wax on there.  But when you're opening the gate in a rush, as I did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and I needed to run upstairs to shut the windows, I put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide, and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket.  The first time I did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and I wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby.  My hand got pinched under that metal part and I thought to myself that I need to be more careful. But busy parents like us don't have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate.  When we've got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows, the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a SAFETY gate!! I dont' mean to beat a dead horse, but seriously, that's not good.  The pinch I got today was major painful - I've got a blood blister that's almost half an inch long!
+1	Our house is a front to back split. We have a lot of stairs. 5 openings to stairs! These gates have been great for my sanity. At first we bought a big playard gate that we opened up to cover two sets of stairs. I had to climb over that at least 100 times a day! Now we have these walk-through stair gates which are easy to use when holding the baby. Before we also had a gate that just expanded to fit the door way and was attached to walls. I was always concerned my daughter would fall down the steps if the gate gave way because she would pull herself up on it. These gates I know they are locked and they are much sturdier. I like that they slide back and forth; it's easier to get through entries.We used wood that matched our stair case so that we didn't have to drill into the post of our railing. I highly recommend this gate.
+1	I bought these for my 2 yr old for Easter, and he loves this set!  It's a great deal and comes with a ton of dinosaurs (and love that the name of the dinosaur is printed on the belly!).  The &#34;mat&#34; that it comes with is a cheesy piece of plastic and not to scale, and we rarely use it, but a great value just for all the dinos and the storage bin.
+1	So the container they come in is a little hard to open and close for small children but no less the fact that it comes in it's own organizational container is very pleasing.  The bottom of each of the dinosaurs states what dinosaur it is a model of. I use a set of flash cards with information about the dinosaurs in combination with these dinosaurs to teach my son while we play. These are nothing more than dinosaur figures but they are very accurate with no odd color combinations like purple with pink spots or something silly like that. They are made of hard durable plastic. I think they are slightly expensive for what they are you can buy similar products at the dollar store but those products like the educational value of these ones.  Overall, I would recommend these my son finds them fun to play with and they stimulate his imagination.  I only give them 4 stars because they are slightly expensive.
+1	My son loves to play "dino world" just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it.
+1	As I am wtitng this review my 5 year old son just re-discovered this set, since I had it at the top of the closet. He can play hours with this great quality dinosaurs he got for his b-day. He had a few more, big and small ones that he just added to this set, so it is pretty amazing what he does when he's playing with all of them. The quality of the mat is awful, but you really don't need the mat for this set.
+1	No complaints about this one.  Baby loves it.  We love it!
+1	My daughter likes the sounds and interaction with the toy, but gets frustrated that she is "trapped" and can't roll easily on carpet.
+1	My daughter is 12 months today. We have had this walker for 2-3 months. She still loves it. She has snack time in front of the TV in it and I am able to speed clean. OF COURSE, I wouldn't leave her alone in it. She is pretty active - not walking yet - but she loves to climb. I don't think she could ever climb out of it, but I'm not going to chance it.We haven't had any problems with it... safety or otherwise... I started to buy the mini mastreo walker but was turned off by some of the reviews. The main reason I bought this one is, reviews on that one were mostly displeased with how hard it was to turn. This one is very easy to turn. My girl spins in circles, even on the carpet and on our wood deck!Yes, it is bulky, but have you seen a walker that's not? They have to be so that they can't be tipped over! The only problem I have with it is... there is not a volume switch. It is not too loud, but when you've had a rough day and have a nice headache to prove it - keep them away from this toy!
+1	As the mother of six grown children, I realize the importance of a playpen when babies start to explore their environment...we can't watch them every moment. I am now a grandmother who babysits for my daughter. I ordered this to use at my own home, and have had such a good experience with it that I ordered a second one for her to use at her house. The color is vibrant for lots of visual stimulation. The playpen is also a good size. Take it from this grandmother that this is definitely the best. 5 stars*****
+1	Good size (36 x 36), durable, sturdy.  Colorful and the little bugs on the mesh wall are a great interactive addition; that's a plus plus for me and the over riding reason why we got this specific playpen.
+1	I am so happy with this play yard.  When  I put my four month old down inside it he looked around then looked up at me and smiled, I kid you not.  The only complaint I have is that the description here on Amazon says that the play yard is 38x38.  However when the box arrived it indicated that it is only 36X36, still plenty of space though.  I only paid $49.00 because I have the Amazon credit card and get reward certificates to use towards products, so between that and the free shipping I got a GREAT BUY for a GREAT PRODUCT.  Thank you Amazon and Graco!
+1	I bought one for my God child who is 6mths old and she loves it.  I couldn't be happier;
+1	I came across this pack n play in Amazon after searching everywhere for a Pack N Play that would last my baby for at least the first year.Everything I saw at Babies R Us was too small, so I decided to take a chance on this one. I was extremely pleased when I received it.It came already assembled, looks beautiful and is big and very durable. Can't beat that.I hightly recommend it.
+1	I finally had to break down and replace my 9yr old playpen (that has been used by 4 children).  I was happy to find that Graco made a square playpen, not only the smaller rectangular Pack N Play.  It arrived today and my daughter loves the bugs and the soft playmat.  I'm happy that it folds up for travel and storage.  Amazon had the best price as well.
+1	I had a rectangular GRACO before, with all the bells and whistles, which I returned because the changing table couldn't hold the baby's weight. I bought this one and I am very happy. Baby is safe, has a lot of room to rollover and she loves to look at th bugs. It is just harder to find sheets but you can find them here at amazon. Easy to set up. I just wish it had wheels to move around the house.
+1	I love this nice, big playpen.  Lots of room to practice/learn crawling.  Lots of things to look at: primary colors and geometric shapes and things on the side to play with.  Mat wipes clean and doesn't absorb fluids (pee, drool, drinks; you just wipe them up, don't need to wait for mat to dry or anything).  It's very sturdy and easy to put together AND the latches latch very easily.  I think it's rated up to 30lbs (or when the child can climb out, of course).Potential drawbacks:-Takes up lots of floor space (worth it to me for the extra crawling room).-It has built in noise-making toys on walls: a crinkle wing butterfly & a rattle bumblebee. Neither are very loud, but still, they aren't detachable & might bother some people.  It also has a louder squeaky toy built into the ladybug on one side but I don't think a child could squeak it on their own; in fact my preschooler knows how and isn't strong enough to compress it enough to produce a squeak.  It has to be squeezed from both sides--so maybe if the ladybug was up against a wall the child could press the ladybug into the wall and squeak it, but that's easily solved by putting the ladybug facing out.-Mirror is up too high to be seen by a baby until the child can sit up on their own.-Once it's assembled it's not simple to move.  Apart from the four corner feet, there are four support feet (for a total of 8 feet) and no wheels on any of them. (But many of the wheeled playpens are so difficult to navigate that you don't move them much either.)-It's surprising how MUCH it stands out in a regular room--so big and so brightly colorful, it is not going to blend in to most adult decor AT ALL.  I think it also comes in black, though.  The black one may not have the noise-making built-ins, I'm not sure.None of the potential drawbacks bothered me much, but they were a bit of a surprise.  I'm still very happy--it's easy to assemble and is one of the bigger portable playpens available.  As a bonus it comes in a large box AKA "toy" for other youngsters. ;-)UPDATE:  We've been using it for 6 months now and LOVE IT!  We have an always moving one year old baby.  The high walls keep him from climbing out, the extra supporting legs handle it when he jumps, falls or flops down with all his might.  The built in toys on the walls are still in great shape (I'm still the only one who can make the ladybug squeak).  It is just so nice to have a play pen big enough for him to actually PLAY in.
+1	I'm a grandma and this is the shape of playpen that was in use when my children were babies except that they were a bit larger (about 42" square play area vs the current 36" square play area). I find this shape to be less confining than the usual playpens now available that are basically the same thing as putting the baby in a bed.Playpens weren't this cute back then, but every bit as handy. It is not only a perfectly safe and controlled area in which babies can learn to play and quietly make sense of their world, but it provides great peace of mind for parents and grandparents to be able to put the baby down in a safe place while talking on the phone or doing something that does not allow for hands-on and undivided supervision. This unit is well built, stable, portable, and easy to fold (once you get the hang of it, it's not exactly intuitive).How could it be better? I would like the padding to be a little bit thicker, I would like the play area to be a little bit larger (so two babies could play there comfortably, like in the "old" days), and I would like a removable and washable cover to the pad instead of having to make my own.But, this review is based on it being the best that is available now and it living up fully to the product description.
+1	I recently bought this for my 8 month old daughter after researching a lot of playpens online and talking to several of my mommy friends.  This exceeded my expectations for a travel crib.This is the perfect balance between being spacious enough for an active tot without taking up your entire living room.  I like that it is self contained (i.e. has a base that sits above the floor) and that it has some built-in toys.  It also is very easy to fold and unfold.  We bought a Graco Travel Lite portacrib for my daughter when she was three months old for traveling with and while it was great when we could use it as a bassinet, as soon as we put her down in the crib section she HATED it (tough "mattress", very small - but exceptionally light &lt;20 lbs).We usually stay somewhere that has a crib, but if we took a car trip I would definitely bring this with both for sleeping and playing.I agree with the other reviewers that I wish this came with a sheet (or that Graco even made a sheet for this).  That being said, it only took me about 10 minutes to make a fitted sheet for this on my sewing machine (it looks something like a large European pillow case).
+1	Just got this playpen a few days ago. It is awesome! Set it up without instructions in under 2 minutes, and I'm 6 months pregnant which makes some things a challenge. It's a very nice size and fits a good deal of toys, though if the room is small it does take up a lot of space. Baby loves the bug toys on the sides. She's just learning to sit on her own and I was very pleased to see when she fell back she did not cry - the floor pad is thick and soft so it cushioned her head. I like that because she did fall backwards once in her gym (placed on the carpet) and was very upset. With this I know if she falls back she won't get hurt. It's very colorful and she really seems to enjoy her time in it. Great purchase!
+1	Love it!  Baby gets plenty of entertainment and the product is big enough for him to really move around.
+1	Set up takes less than a minute and great as a portable playard. The toys on the sides are a lot of fun for baby. The colors are bright and cheerful. My 6 month old loves it. A little heavy to carry (I'm 5'2") but still highly, highly recommended!
+1	This blanket is wonderful.  I got it for my husband who is a Penn State grad and there is more than an attachment to his alma mater with this one.  The blanket is one of the thickest ones you can get, very durable, super soft, and extraordinarily warm.  I highly recommend it over the other Penn State blankets.  Basically look for the ones in the "stripes series" by Raschel.
+1	We love this playpen. The colors are great and the attached toys are engaging. It folds up and unfolds easily and the case that comes with it is really going to come in handy when we go on vacation. =)
+1	If I ever have to contain a potential bio-hazard, this is what I use.  Quick to set up and easy to put away or take with you, this little baby has enough room to give your baby some play space in the middle of the most hazardous locations.
+1	This is a great for play.  I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However, I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep.  Unfortunately, the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets (must be purchased from company other than Graco) cause the pad to be a little lumpy.  My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it, it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do.  I am happy with it.
-1	We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the  type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child. There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco, so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits (in the owner's manual) as the regular pack-n-play. Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered, the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily, Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back, but we are quite disappointed.
+1	Fantastic product. Our child loves playing in this pack 'n play. Even if we don't put toys inside the walls are moderately entertaining for our child. The sun has a mirror (plastic kind that sort of warps images), the butterfly has crinkly wings (fabric with plastic inside for noise), another side has a bug with wings inside and the final side has a squeaker (which is really hard to use).It's all one piece so no &#34;assembly&#34; ever required. The sides are collapsible with the push of a button on each side. The ground mat that the child sits on servers as the exterior of the case that holds the pole-assembly together when folded up. And there's a light-plastic zipper bag with handle that serves as a carrying case. It packs up into a long rectangle, probably 1x1x8 feet.Pros:- Pack up or unpack in under a minute, no &#34;assembly&#34; required just set it and lock it into place like a collapsible baby stroller.- Sturdy build, child won't be able to tip it over and it would never fold on itself.- Soft but strong mesh walls that child can see through but can't stick fingers or small objects through mesh.Cons:- This is a minor complaint: the squeaker on one of the walls is impossible for a child to squeak - you have to press it from both sides of the wall because it's sewn so tightly- As a side-effect of the sturdiness it's very heavy. On the plus side of that, it is made of sturdy materials.
+1	Really the best product for the kid . Soft and hard enough at the same time. WOnderful colors, great toys ...Love it till every little bit of it.
+1	I was able to pull this out of the box and put it together and less than a minute. It is very colorful and the toys are very cute. I have a 3 month old that is a little to small to play with them, but she like to lay in there and look around at the toys and the colors. The bottom pad is cushioned but not very much. I think it is soft enough for naps and play time though. My 8 month old played in there last night and scooted his bottom around in there and played with the toys for about an hour. This is a larger playpen that would be hard to move from room to room. IT is 3 feet by 3 feet w/ no wheels on the bottom. I have it set up in the corner of the living room where I will keep it. There is noting about this that I do not like. My only change would be to have a cover that was washable for the bottom, but luckily I do not have a baby that spits up.
+1	My grandson thoroughly enjoys it, even though he is still very young.  He is fascinated with the decor, even the butterflies on the bottom.  My son and daughter-in-law are very pleased with its functionality and ease of set up.  A great place for my grandson to learn to exercise his limbs safely.
+1	I love, love, love this play pen, its money will spent, it roomy and colourful, would defin. recommend. it makes noises as well.
+1	why do I love this play pan?  Very simple:1. Great quality material; sturdy and safe2. Large with lots of space (my grandson crawls around).  Can fit two kids!3. Very easy to assemble!3. Very colorful!  Bright beautiful colors.  My grandson looks at it and want to jump from my arms inside of the pan.4. The colorful patches around it are toys!The toys are:a) A beautiful butterfly with wings that when squeezed it make a dried plastic sound (he loves it)b) A lady bug that makes sounds alsoc) A sun with a mirror (safe for babies)d) A bee with playful wings, which also makes soundsI strongly recommend this play pan!  My daughter has another one, not Graco, that is half of the size.  It is nice but not eye catching like this one.It is worth every single penny!
+1	Graco Tot Block with Bugs is a pack and play that features figures of bugs on each of the sides for added fun. Kids enjoy playing with the bugs and each offers something slightly different. The bee has its two wings extended inside of the playpen and the wings make a rattling noise when moved. The butterfly's wings are also extended inside the playpen and they offer the sound of paper being crinkled. The ladybug has a squeak toy inside its body to create its own unique sound and the sun has a mirror for a child's enjoyment. Each offers its own type of stimulation and since they are built in, they are always there. There is no need to worry that the toys will be lost.Besides the toys, the other reason kid's love the Graco Tot Block with Bugs is for its bright colors. Most playpens are dark blue or dark green in color and offer nothing that is visually appealing. This pack and play, however, offers combinations of bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Babies seem more entranced with this playpen than with the plain colored playpens. They like looking at the bright colors and playing with the interactive, built- in toys on the sides of the playpen.Like other pack and plays, Graco Tot Block folds up for easy storage. You need to remove the pad from the inside before you fold the unit because the pad acts as a cover for the rest of the playpen. Once you have the playpen folded, it slips inside of the pad using Velcro straps to secure it in place. Once the pad has been wrapped, the entire unit then slips into a plastic bag with a zipper to keep it shut. This is simple enough, but I have noticed that this pack and play weighs a little more than others and it is also a little more awkward to remove and set up. It helps to have a second person to open it up and prepare it for use. But this is only a minor inconvenience because it can still be set up with little effort.With all of the stimulation offered with this playpen, there is one possible disadvantage: It could keep your child from falling asleep. If your goal for buying this playpen is strictly to have a place for your youngster to play, then the added stimulation will be an asset. But if you want to place your child in the playpen for a quick nap, you might have some difficulty due to the attention- grabbing colors and interactive toys. These toys cannot be removed from the walls of the playpen so they could definitely create a distraction that could prevent some kids from falling asleep.Graco recommends this playpen for smaller kids up to approximately two years of age. If your child is older, then you should not use this playpen because he/she might be able to climb out. Most kids age two or under, however, will be small enough to use this playpen. Also, even though there is no defined limit for the number of kids who can play inside this device, I think it should be limited to two. Any more than two and the kids will begin to get frustrated with the constant bumping into each other.Overall, this is a very good pack and play from Graco and it ranks among my child's favorite playpens. The colors and interactive, built in toys make it a favorite among all kids and while it does weigh a little more than other pack and plays and does require more effort to unpack and set up, it still makes a good choice for parents of small children. The interactive toys can't get lost and the unit's bright colors make it appealing to children and adults alike.
+1	Buy this Pack N Play!!  All pros and no cons on this.  It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags. Only three parts, just the frame, the folding padded floor, and the carrying bag.  It is roomy, has plenty of padding, and has 9 legs for a strong and even base.  It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market.
-1	Be very careful using this play pen. My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on. He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen. Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes. At first I couldn't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting. From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on.
+1	Our family loves this product! We used it from infancy to over age one year. It was very easy to set up and assemble the first time. Directions very easy to follow and took only minutes to assemble. It has very easy to clean fabric. Just wipe it down. Baby loved the toys on each side of the play pen and also the colorful block pattern on the mat. The size and height of this product is just perfect. Large play area inside. This product has held up to alot of use for over a year and still looks new! It came with a reusable bag to store it in and make for easy carry in car. Also, we found no safety issues w/this product. I did alot of research before choosing this product and this one meets our high standards. I highly recommend it.
+1	LOVE this pack n play!! It is very large compared to standard pack n plays and the bright colors are refreshing rather than the normal drab colors.  There are toys built into the mesh walls which provide easy entertainment.  It's very easy to put up and take down.
+1	We love it. Great for the patio or when baby needs to be confined so gma can powder her nose. Keeps the dog and baby apart.
+1	Just like so many other reviews, I highly recommend this Playard.  It is easy to set up and take down.  The bright colors are exciting for little ones.  It is a decent size and the quality seems fine, so it should last awhile.  I bought a sheet made to fit the square playard, so we can use it for resting too.  The bright colors can be a distraction if you intend to use it for napping.  For play time, it's great.
+1	I am very thankful I chose this particular pack-n-play. I've seen the ones my friends have for their babies and I definitely got the best one!!! It also folds up easily and stores nicely. It is a little heavy, but they all are to me. It is sturdy and I think it will last. Sheets that fit this particular model are pricey, though, as it's not the average rectangular shape. Other than that, it is perfect! My daughter loves it and so do I!
+1	This is large enough for a bigger baby which is why I bought it.  My daughter is long so it was perfect. I haven't had her in here during the day but I'm sure she'll love the cartoons printed.  I bought it as a second bed for when she's at her grandma's knowing that she'll be able to fit in it for a while.
+1	This play pen is great in that it is so much more roomy then my childs standard size one. it has the great colors and added toys on it to keep him happy and busy.
+1	This Play Yard is brightly colored which my son loves, it takes a bit of getting use to for breaking it down and putting it up. And i love how the mat in it is easy to clean. When my son spits up its very easy to wipe up off the mat it doesn't soak in. And we love how it has more room than most that are from the stores where we live.
+1	I purchased this square playpen for an 8 month and 18 month old (not at the same time of course).  I have purchased a few pack n plays rectangular and a few of these square playpens.  You would think they are the same, but they are not.  The pack n plays are great for naps, (I would say 18 months and younger), and easy to transport and some come with a bassinet for babies.  I have used those strictly for naps, as they are not that stable or large enough for play.  This square playpen is ideal!!!  It is so sturdy.  Easy to set up, take down.  Perfect for when you need to get something done.  It keeps those walking and crawling confined, but still gives plenty of space for them and a few of their toys.  The 18 month child seems perfectly content playing and falling asleep in it, whereas the pack n play, he hated it.  Couldn't stand up without falling down.Gives you the much needed break so you can get things done.  Since this is for short terms during the day and I give him some toys, he doesn't mind it.  Then I put him in a portable crib for sleeping.  In my honest opinion, the square playpen is much better for him and safer than the portable crib, but foster services states you have to have a crib, not playard for sleeping.  I feel much more comfortable having the child in the playpen than the crib.He also likes the bright colors.  It is a little heavier than the pack n plays rectangular.  It is not something I would take along where I had to carry it very far.  But it does pack up the same as the pack n plays, and you could transport it to a grandparents house, or babysitter, or the park.  Just a little heavier and larger than the pack n plays.  This has been a lifesaver!!  In my opinion, works better than using those portable plastic pens.  I tried that, didn't last long.  Wouldn't go back to that, and have no problems recommending these square playpens.The ones I purchased came with a thick padded mat.  It is very substantial and seems to work fine.  However, I guess you could add padding underneath if you needed to.This is perfect if you wanted something for a grandparents house, it could be used for play or sleeping and then easily stored away taking little room.  These square ones do not have wheels, so if you needed something really portable, you might want the rectangular.  If you are using for both play and sleep, I would suggest limiting the time the child is in the pen, so they see that as more of a rest area than confinement.
+1	I saw this playpen and thought it was adorable, bright colored, and fun. But I already have another pack and play and I read it was big and cost 100 dollars so I placed it on my private wish list. Well, to my lovely surprise, my mother had also independently seen this playpen on Amazon and bought it for my little baby boy. It is truly awesome and my son loves it! What I love about it? Well.......it's so nicely colored, screams cuteness all over, and it's very easy to set up and take down. I also love how spacious it is and I have fun playing peek-a-boo with my little one too! They say mothers know best..... and in my case.... that was true! Buy it, you won't regret it.
+1	this playpen is just way too adorable!  its colorful there lots of stuff to look at and touch, it has a mirror, crinkly, squeaker and a rattle on the inside my daughter loves this great buy!
+1	I LOVE these because they are really convenient and easy to use. We have it by our pool (baby gated) under the overhang so we can enjoy the pool and sun and yet have LO out there playing or asleep at the same time. It is very convenient. I do not like the cleaning issues. It is hard to clean and though it is billed &#34;PACK N PLAY&#34; like it is the &#34;umbrella stroller&#34; of play yards, it is hardly that easy to just fold and run.
+1	I'm an older mom (40+) who did a lot of babysitting as a teen and remembers what big, square playpens used to be like...not the cramped, rectangular things everyone has now. This spacious pack and play is wonderful! Our 10-month-old daughter loves it - we have it in our kitchen so we can set her in it for a few minutes while we use the stove or chop up food (cases where, for obvious reasons, we wouldn't want her underfoot). She can see us, we can talk with her, and she has plenty of room to practice pulling herself up and walking along the edges (and falling on her bum on the padded floor). When she was younger, she loved playing with the attached toys (especially the butterfly with the crinkly wings).It's sturdy, easy to set up and take down, and packs away neatly into its carrying case. An all-around great product!
+1	Amazing, adorable, colorful, safe, and giant!  Folds up easily and not too heavy to carry around if you want to take it.  The ideal playpen.
+1	Love this playpen. We put toys in there and our son love being in there. The toys that are attached to the playpen are great and our babie always tries to touch them. It's pretty spacious compared to typical other playpen
+1	We got this for my baby when she was about 7 months and getting mobile so we needed somewhere to put her if we needed to do something without holding her.  It is the standard length of a traditional playpen, but the width is the same as well which gives babies much more space to crawl around in and play than the typical playard.  It is very simple to put up and take down.  My baby has only slept in it one night and it was fine for her.  It is very sturdy and the bottom mat has tabs that snap into the base of the frame for extra stability. The colors are bright which is good for the baby but doesn't exactly fit into my home decor. The sides each have a toy- a mirror, two rattle butterflies and one squeek lady bug.  The squeek is really hard to press so I often hold my hand on one side of the pen for stability and press on the other side but that is only an extra feature so I'm not really disappointed.  This is the most affordable by far of the larger size playpens and I'm very happy with my choice.
+1	Hard to find a pack & play this large anymore and with the twins coming it will be great to have.
+1	Superb!  It's a "must have".  She is able to play independently and you don't have to worry.
+1	Needed a safe fun place near my home office and this was perfect. Also plan to take it when we travel.Some features our 8 month old granddaughter find entertaining. Easy set up and seems sturdy, well constructed.Love Graco.
+1	I like it for the size and all the colors. Bugs on the sides are somewhat entertaining with rattles and squeaks.
+1	This is a great play space for our son! We have a sizable great room, which is child-proofed and gated off from the rest of the house. But once our son started crawling, we needed a safe place to put him while working in the kitchen. We had a regular pack-n-play, but it seemed cramped. This is perfect! It's roomy enough for him to spread out with a few books or toys, and entertain himself for long enough that we can put away groceries, cook a meal, or do a load of dishes. Everyone's happy!
+1	Fantastic piece of baby gear!  Our 7-month-old loves the toys on the mesh walls, and he has plenty of space to scoot around.  We've found that the Carters jersey knit crib sheets can stretch to fit over the floor in this Pack 'N Play, which gives us the option of having a washable surface.  The bright colors don't exactly blend with our household decor, but we'll live.  So happy we made this purchase, and what a great price from Amazon!
+1	I recently bought this for 7 month old daughter who is just starting to crawl. It the perfect thing to keep her amused for anywhere from 20minutes to an hour! It means I can go to the bathroom in peace and get some chores done knowing she is safe and amused.It is super easy to put together - it literally takes less than a minute - take out of the box - unfold it and it clicks into place. The pictures on the side are of good quality and my daughter likes to pull and play with them.We also have a weekend home - so bought two of these. I would guess this could also double as a crib for the weekend house - ie - for a night or two at a time.Highly recommend for the 7 - 10 month phase of baby's development.
+1	I like that this has more room than the standard rectangular Graco Pack 'N Plays. It's easy to set up and works well.
+1	This was perfect for traveling when my child was under 2. She loved the decorations on it and she was able to play with them. It is larger than an average pack n play, which was nice when she slept.
+1	Bought this play-yard to be both a place for my 7-month old grandson to sleep during his visit as well as a temporary 'holding pen' for putting him down for a moment. He slept comfortably at night, and was fascinated by the butterfly and other adornments on the mesh walls of the play-yard when awake. I recommend this product. Its made well, easy enough to open and close, and definitely worked out well for me.
+1	I was looking for something for my 7 month old daughter to keep her safe when I need to leave the room.  I wanted something large and that I could travel with for her to sleep in. I think for the price this is well made. The pad it comes with is good and the colors and extra toys on the side are fun for her.
+1	After our son discovered yet another non-child-friendly item on the floor of our home and hoarded it in his mouth for hours (unbeknownst to us), my wife and I decided we wanted another prison--I mean "play yard"--for our son to roam around in because apparently we're terrible at the whole concept of baby-proofing.So I found this item on Amazon and, through my sleeplessness, thought the dimensions were 9' x 9'--sounded like a steal for $90.  We ordered this one and I was a bit dismayed when the box showed up and it turned out to be another pack n' play.  Like probably most other parents, we already have the obligatory pack n' play.  It's small and cozy and our son likes it fine.  I told my wife and she was more than a bit dismayed: another pack n' play she did not want.  (She also wondered how I thought the dimensions were 9' by 9', but that's another story.)Well, we could have returned it with the free returns, but after we got it set up and plopped our son it in, we were hooked and so was he.  Here's why it's ten times better than your average pack n' play:1.  The colors are so vibrant--reds, blue, green, yellow--as opposed to the muted colors you often see on a pack n' play.2.  Each wall of the pack n' play has a different feature: for instance, one wall has a ladybug that squeaks; another has a butterfly that moves and rustles; another has a bee that also moves and rustles; and another has a sun with a mirror on it.  Although the mirror is not the fanciest mirror I've ever seen, it keeps our budding narcissist fascinated for minutes at a time.3.  It's sturdier than any pack n' play I've seen, and the walls don't budge when he stands up in it, but it's also squishy enough to withstand falls.  I've seen my son fall plenty of times inside of it, and he hasn't seemed bothered.  Perhaps he caught his reflection on the way down.4.  Though not 9' x 9', it's bigger than any pack n' play I've ever seen.  (Note: I've heard this can cause problems if you're using it for sleep, because it can be harder to find sheets that fit, though apparently you can find people who make special square sheets instead of the standard rectangular sheets.)5.  Our son actually likes going in there, unlike his other pack n' play (or--god forbid--his North States Superyard play yard--you'd think we'd sent him to Guantanamo Bay).Overall, it really just looks like a fun, happy, and bright place to be in, and it's well made and looks like it will last for a while, and perhaps most importantly, our son doesn't fuss when we put him in there, and, to state the obvious, putting him in there keeps him away from the unmentionable hazards on the floors of our home.  So although I don't think you need TWO pack n' plays, I'm not too sad that I made the reading error and ordered this one by mistake, because this particular pack n' play is awesome.To sum it up, if you're going to buy one pack 'n play, buy this one, because it's the clear winner.
+1	I'm gonna start by saying I really love these bottles. They work great for me and my baby. She doesn't get all that gas she used to get with other bottles anymore and she seems very comfortable with the nipples. Plus the disposable liners make cleaning so much easier and faster. I love the way the cap compresses the nipple so you can be sure there will be no accidents while mixing formula, except for the orthodontic nipple which has the little hole on one side, but we don't really use that one, so it doesn't matter to us.That being said, I must warn you IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE EASY-FEED BOTTLE like the description says and that's the main reason I got this set, otherwise I would've gotten the prettier ones. Apparently they don't make the easy feed anymore.I still gave this bottles five stars cuz they're the best we've tried. Helped a lot with our little colicky baby and they are a blessing when it comes to cleaning. We have a zillion nipples and just a few bottles so we only replace the nipples on the nursers and we're good to go.
+1	I like these bottles better than the Premium Nursers. Here's why:1. They don't break as easily when dropped (or thrown!)2. The caps are more streamlined and work for all different types of nipples. The clear domed caps on the Premiums don't work with the orthodontic nipple, and that's all I use.I would have rather received 2 of these sets instead of one of the Premium sets I got.
+1	We used Playtex drop-in bottles and my son loved them. He was able to hold them by himself when he was three months old. We started with the slow flow nipple very early and he had nipple confusion. Later we moved on the Y-cut nipple which is great because it doesn't spill like the medium and fast flow.
+1	since my 1st child to my new grandson, I do not remember ever having a bottle be more easy on the stomach and prevent colic.Even my colicky babydid the very best when I used these. Nothing else has ever done better and these are less hassle in the cleaning area and while you have to keep buying the inserts,they are affordable,I bought the others but they are just ideasMD's helped develop, doesn't mean they work as well, 'cuz they don't!!!I'd go with Playtex every time.
+1	My 6 week old hated bottles until these came in. He had his choice of 5 nipples and likes the latex slow flow the best. Even my husband is able to feed him with ease (breastfed babies are picky!). I love how easily I can store unfinished breast milk. I recommend this to everyone. It would make a great Baby Shower present!
+1	Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles.  Quick cleanup, quick fill up.  Love the nipple variety too.Because of the liners, it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces, etc.Would highly recommend.
+1	My breastfed baby took very easily to these bottles. They're sturdy and durable. The only times I've had difficulties with leaking is when I've failed to properly use thePlaytex Drop-Ins Disposable Bottle Liners, 8 oz, 50 Liners. I wish Playtex wasn't phasing out these bottles because they feel much sturdier than their Premium counterparts.
+1	These are the only bottles I can get my son to take.  He hates the silicone nipples, so these are great alternative.
+1	Great set, but you'll need more nipples. At least 2 out of the 5 are Fast Flow, which I didn't use until my baby was 8-9 months old. The nipples are like $4 for a 2pk, so add that to the cost when comparison shopping.Other than that, I love these bottles! I don't have a single complaint about them. I do not use a bottle warmer. They do leak in the diaper bag when not kept upright, but I store mine upright, so that's a non-issue.
+1	My daughter wasn't drinking out of the bottle. The laytex nipple was the only one shes takes. Its soft and is the most like a breast. But  I  didn't know why she wouldn't drink the bottle until I smelled the milk.  It had gone bad. So I learned that if you heat the milk ( not boil it) right after you pump then store it in good bags the milk stays fresh, and baby eats while i'm at work.  There is no better feeling for you (and grandma whos watching her)  when you know that shes happy while you are at work.
+1	Not a bad price for all of the items included.  I wish they gave more nipples though.  They give several drop-in liners, 4 oz and 8 oz.  But for the price, its worth it.
-1	With all the rave reviews and my love for Playtex VentAir bottles, I was very excited about this bottle. Yet, both me and my baby hated it. First off, the bottle itself is huge, which makes it uncomfortable in many ways. Second, even the slow flow nipple somehow seems too fast and makes my baby choke on his milk. In any case, we used it a couple of times and went right back to VentAir. I would not recommend it.
+1	We got this set at our shower and haven't needed any other bottles. My son started using them at about four weeks old and quickly outgrew the smaller bottles, but the set includes three larger ones, which is great. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that they don't include the medium flow nipples, just fast and slow. My baby was impatient with the slow flow and overwhelmed by the fast, so we had to purchase the medium ones separately. It's also a little irritating to have to keep buying the drop-in inserts, but it does cut down on the dishes.
+1	Several weeks ago I left a 2 star review for these bottles due to the cost of always having to buy liners with twins...as you can see I have since changed my mind and deleted that review. Why? To avoid buying more liners and since my girls are now 13 months old, we bought some other bottles that don't use a liner. After having used ONLY Playtex Drop Ins for the 1st year and then using other types of bottles for around a month I am realizing how much not only myself but my girls LOVED the Playtex Drop Ins.The Playtex Nipples are definately what my girls prefer and are much easier for them. They normally finish their night time bottles but have not been finishing them since switching to different bottles. Also the new bottles have tons of air bubbles where the Playtex did NOT.The nipple size is also good for Preemie babies. When my girls were born they were too small to suckle on the breast and most bottles were too big for their tiny mouths. I do remember when my girls were under a month old we had some Advent bottles w/ silicone nipples someone had given us and I tried giving them to my girls once(the more bottles the merrier) but my girls HATED the nipples and they just seemed to big for their small mouths. I had to empty the Advent and pour them into the Playtex.And when I first wrote my 2 star review of these bottles because I hated the repeated cost of buying liners, that was also before I realized just how FANTASTICALLY WONDERFUL it is to be able to throw away the liner. Since we've bought these new bottles it seems all I ever do is wash bottles...and there have been MANY times when I forget I leave a bottle that had milk in the diaper bag or some other place and GROSS, what a stinky mess. Then I actually have to soak the bottles in bleach water to make sure they are clean. With the Playtex you simply throw away the stinky liner.So I am sorry Playtex Drop Ins that I ever doubted you & gave you a 2 star review. I guess this past month of Never-Ending Bottle washing & bleaching bottles has been my lesson learned. NEVER AGAIN will I use any other bottle besides Playtex Drop Ins. Except for water or juice, cheap bottles are fine for that.So save yourself time & money and just buy the Playtex Drop Ins ESPECIALLY if you have twins. It might cost more in liners but you'll be Thankful in the long run. My girls like the Playtex Latex nipples the best.You can buy store brand liners, we've used Walmart store brand and they work fine but Playtex are definately the best liner. Keep an eye out because the Playtex liners DO go on sale and then you can stock up. Make sure you have plenty on hand so you don't get stuck in the middle of the night w/out any liners. I also liked the bags but we only used them at first when I was pumping breast milk for my girls. You can use different brands of bags for these as well.
+1	These bottles always worked out for my daughter. Easy cleanup with the bags, and less gas. She's down to just her night time bottle now.
-1	I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong. I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle. I figured I would be saving time because I wouldn't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday. Well, you aren't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle. Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins. If I'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out. Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on, by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle. Also they are not good for on the go. There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all
+1	It's super convenient. Everything's light so they are easy to carry around as well. It's even better because the liner is recyclable.
+1	This is a great set. The Playtex breast milk storage system is a VERY easy way to store breastmilk in the freezer, and works well with Medela pumps. I've pumped at work for about 2 months and it's gone pretty smoothly. I use a mix of these and Medela storage bottles.I especially like that the liners are BPA free.
+1	My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them. I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct!All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child. I'm really liking what I'm reading about the Dr. Brown's, but will possibly try a couple other brands as well. I'm realizing that saving tons of money isn't always what's best for my daughter. We'll see!
+1	The cute, fancy little burp cloths on the market are no match for babies that spit up like mine do. These wash well, are absorbent, USUALLY cover enough of the shoulder/arm to prevent clothing from becoming a mess, and are very soft. We could not make it without these!
-1	I had these exact same burp clothes when I gave birth in 08 to my son so I figured with my second pregnancy I would buy them again big mistake they are made cheaper NOW you can see right through them I am going to have to fold them in half just so it will not go through on to my clothes I do not even think they will make it through a wash load what a disappointment they are worth maybe a dime each at best It is kinda hard to tell how thin they are unless you open the package I would suggest passing these up
+1	Good diaper cloths! Been using it with my first born and now with my 1 month old baby.Will help you prevent diaper rash. Tiring to change everytime the baby wets the cloth though and time consuming to wash but worth it than having problems with diaper rash. It is really hard to use cloth diapers for the whole day so use cloth during day time and then disposable at night for longer sleep.
+1	I purchased these to make burp cloths. I washed them, then sewed fabric to the center piece to customize them. We used the burp cloths for months!
+1	I used to work as a nanny while I was going to college and I am buying lot of baby products for my best friend (she was my &#34;student loan&#34; - and that's how I am paying her back... buying the baby products, anyway)... she know I had over 7+y of experience taking care of babies and the items I'm buying for her are things I used during my sitter years and I know they're practical and they work great.
+1	I have to say I have not been disappointed with this warmer, other than it should not be used with the Playtex inserts bottles (which is why it gets 4 stars) as it cannot sense the heat properly and makes them way too hot and doesn't shut off. My best advice? Read the directions! I was shocked at how little water it uses and thought I was reading it wrong. Do not use more water than the directions say for your bottle size! It is correct, and when followed it heats the bottle perfectly every time. All of the water disappeared and the light turns off when it's done. I honestly cannot understand how people could say they read the directions and it still didn't work, but hey that's just me. Definitely recommend! If you have the inserts, you can always use a plastic bottle and pour it in. A must have for when baby is home with daddy, grandma, or anyone else that doesn't have a ton of experience with properly heating a bottle (esp. breastmilk).
+1	My wife love this botles.Is for a better way of feeding our new born.I cant wait to use them.
-1	I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong.  I'd read the directions again and try again.  Another, stinking, melted bottle!  And the milk would be scalding hot.  If it didn't melt the bottle, the milk would still be cold.  I also had a problem with my playtex ventaire bottles leaking from the bottom into the warmer.  Then I had the smell of burned formula in the kitchen.  Oh!  And it melted that bottle too!I'm going back to the old fashioned way.  I'm going to heat water in the microwave and let the bottle soak in it.  It is faster, less messy, and lots cheaper.  Don't waste your time and money.
+1	This is an awesome product!  Once you get used to using this product, it is a huge timesaver.  It took us three tries to get the amount of water right so the bottle would be the right temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  Before going to bed every night, we put two bottles and the ice pack in the cooler section.  When the baby woke up, we transferred one bottle to the warmer.  It was usually done warming before we finished changing a diaper!  You may want to order an additional ice pack so you'll always have one ready in the freezer.  This bottle cooler/warmer makes it easier at night when you want to get back to sleep as soon as possible!
+1	We have tried many bottle warmers and this is the one we currently use. I liked it because it had a section to keep bottles cold as well. This feature sounds good, but in real life, doesn't work as well as it sounds.The bottle warmer works ok but the heating action is inconsistent even if you get the water level on the meniscus the same everytime. This isn't good for breast milk. Also the heating plate accumulates gunk from time to time.It includes a jar food holder to heat food, but we have never tried it.All in all a decent bottle warmer, but you have have to compensate with a re-heat or cold water sometimes.
+1	This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money!
+1	We are using this every night since we bought it. It takes some trial and error to figure out the water requirement but that's OK. It's easy to use, look good and works great! I use to warm breastmilk. Cleaning/descaling is the only issue.
+1	I use this everyday to heat up bottles.. I like how you can keep the frozen ice pack in with bottles to store and keep cool then just pour a little water into the front part to boil the water.  The directions are a little confusing with how much water to use, so i just have kind of learned how much water we need to use and just keep the bottle in there for 4-5 minutes.. you learn by trial and error.  Or if you want to save your money you can always just boil/microwave water and put the bottle in that.  I got this as a gift at my babyshower and I'm happy with it.
+1	When we first got it I thought it was complicated...but it really isn't. You freeze the ice pack and when you're ready to head to bed, you just bring the ice pack and two bottles, place them in the cooler and fill the two measuring water holders and slide them on the side. When your baby wakes up take the water holder off the side and pour into the warmer, place the bottle and then press the button in front to warm. While you're changing your baby the bottle will warm up and be ready by the time you're done.It takes practice, at first you'll probably either overfill the water holder or not fill it enough. For a 4oz warm  Dr Browns bottle we usually filled it to the 6 line, 2 months later we're filling it to the 7 line. 5oz bottles vary between the 7-8 line.  It seems this warmer gets weaker with use and requires more water. You also have to be careful not to spill formula/bm on the warmer or it will get sticky and won't warm the bottle as well. Oh and if you move the bottle more towards the front of the warmer it will warm up quicker.If you put too much water, the bottle will be too hot so if you're not sure start out with the 5-6 line and go from there.There is no nightlight and they shouldn't list it as a feature, the 'nightlight' is the button that glows orange when you press it to warm a bottle. It shuts off after a couple of minutes when the bottle is done.I love this thing because it makes night time feedings almost a breeze but it does have it's quirks. If you have two floors definitely get a bottle warmer, and if you're on a budget this is the best.
-1	I've heard some say this is the best warmer available.  If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better "mouse trap".To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...(picture provided by Amazon is not the current model.  refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers)
+1	Great product.  I use it at nights. It is a lifesaver when my son wakes up and needs his expressed milk instantly. Having the chiller compartment saves me the trip to the refrigerator. Sometimes I forget the ice-pack and will use a ziploc bag with crushed ice as an alternate.  As soon as I pop it in the chamber, by the time I am done changing him - it is ready to go.  I agree the measuring water is confusing so I just check it periodically to ensure the bottle doesn't overheat.  One thing to note is that it heats up glass bottles SUPER fast vs. the plastic bottles.  So if you need speedy turnaround use the Evenflo glass bottles - they heat up in under 3 minutes!
-1	the measuring of the water is not comfortable it take more time to actually put the water at its correct measure than just boiling water in micro and using that to warm the milk
+1	I purchased this to use on the nightstand or for keeping breast milk out.  Unfortunately I ended up having to feel formula, so I used this as a bedside bottle keeper at night.  Two bottle fit in a cooler compartment and one fits in the warmer.  I had absolutely no issues with this item, did what it said.
-1	The idea behind this design is well intentioned but I find the design aggravating. Subconsciously I always go for the handle to move this thing, but the handle is connected to the removable bottle storage piece. There's no other way to pick this thing up unless you grab it by the warmer cup. It may seem trivial but I like to keep this thing out of the way (it's an eye sore) and I would have rather just the bottle warmer with no bottle storage chamber.Plus, the heating is inconsistent. No matter whether you put extra water or not, the bottles still don't get warm like they should. When we first got it (4 months ago) the milk would actually be too hot. That hasn't happened in a while.
+1	So glad I bought his bottle warmer.  Late night feedings have never been easier.  Easy to use.  No complaints yet.
-1	This thing stinks. The on off switch never worked so we always had to plug and unplug it. Plus you can easily over heat your bottles in this. We did like the cooler on the back for travel but overall this thing stinks
+1	Our bed rooms are upstairs and I needed to have a second warmer and one which had a cooler.This is the best buy for the same reason.I simply love it and couldnt live without it.I have used it every single day so far .My son is now 5months and it works great I never timed how much time the bottle is in the warmer not I measured the water. I used to do it when I intially bought it but with a screaming infant in hands during night I stopped bothering about the measurements . even with such a rough use it still works great .never had a little problem with itBut I do make sure that I clean it throughly every week.The cooler part is awesome,saved me trips downstairs in the middle of the night.Being a working mom I am all about making things easy for me.This is what I recommend highly
-1	Do not buy for glass bottles. Says nothing about this on the website but on the box. Very dangerous because gets so hot
+1	ahora la familia descansa mas gracias a este calentador de biberones ya que el tetero se mantiene caliente toda la noches o hasta que el bebe la necesite, no hay necesidad de prender la cocina, solo meterlo en la boca del bebe y a comerrr....
+1	I only used this pump for the first month as I did not produced much milk but it was great when I used it. As a first time mom, I found it very comfortable and easy to use. I also sterilized the pieces after a day of use and each piece came out fine. I did find that I had to bend forward to get maximum output but it was not uncomfortable. If you plan to do a lot of pumping then getting the double pump might be worth the extra money as it is quite time consuming with only one pump. Overall, an efficient pump, no complaints.
+1	I nurse my baby exclusively and am a stay at home mom, but this is really handy for when we go out and can't schedule around his feeding times. I didn't have any problems with let down. It does make noise, but it's not noisy. I only pump at home so it doesn't bother me. I only used this after my baby was 6 weeks and had no problems whatsoever.
+1	This little electrical pump works well. It's only problem is that it's really noisy. I have twins and this pump works just fine.
-1	I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump (Medela Pump in Style) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP! This single electric one just cannot get enough pressure/suction/whatever. plus even if it DID work, a single pump means double the pumping time. I know double electric pumps are expensive, but beg, borrow, get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant. Just don't bother trying this one.
+1	I have the larger, double Pump In Style but I wanted to leave that at work and still have something at home.  I used this to pump in the morning before going to work or if I was unusually full.  It's small and light and perfect for travel.  I'm now onto baby #2 and use this occasionally since I'm now home full time, but this works so well when I need it.  It's efficient and has lasted through 2 babies - Medela is a really great brand!  I wouldn't recommend this if you're pumping often from both sides - get a double pump, but it was a perfect supplemental pump for me.
-1	This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces, don't get this.  In addition to being slow, it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months.  It's a waste of money all around!
+1	Awesome product, a little loud but overall does the job, we rented a machine from the hospital tht did the same for twice the money we paid for this, after realizing we needed additional time and they required additional fees, we opted to purchase this and keep rather than spend it on rental, great choice we made, highly recommended.
+1	This pump is very good.  I had to pump while my daughter was in the hospital the first month of her life.  During the day I used the hospital grade pumps at the hospital, but at night I used this pump until finally buying the double electric Medela pump. I got just as much milk with this pump as I did the hospital pump.  I only used the electric plug, never batteries.  It is a handy pump to have.  I don't see how a nursing mom can go without ever having to pump at some point, even if its for cereal when they start that. Medela is definitely the best pump to get, and don't even think about a manual one.  I never pump now since I'm home with my baby, but I am so glad I have this pump. It is definitely loud, but putting a folded towel over it helps.  If you have to pump a lot, and can afford it, a double pump is the way to go though...it takes half the time, which is very important when you have a baby to take care of.
+1	This gate is grate especially if you have pets and stairs.  The only thing I didn't like about the gate is how hard it is to bend/configure each panel of the gate.
+1	This gate was perfect for our split-level home with the addition of one 24&#34; extension. It does the job of keeping the baby away from the stairs and the dog out of where she isn't allowed. My husband said it was very easy to install. The stay-open and auto-close features are great. I plan on buying another for the bottom set of stairs.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I do feel like it could be slightly sturdier for the abuse my three-year-old tries to give it.
+1	I'm quite happy with the gate, although I had to spend $250 to make it fit the bottom of my stairs. I removed the left 24" panel, replaced with an 8" extension, then inserted 3 more 8" extensions on the right.  The $30 8" extensions are way too expensive for what you get I think (and often arrive with scratches and rust due to the extra pole in the box).Like many Kidco gates, the instructions could have been better.  And it would be nice if the mounting hardware were metal instead of plastic.I used a 1/8" drill bit to create pilot holes before screwing into my banister (rather hard wood).  While it may be obvious to some to do that, others might not know, or might not know what size drill bit to use.  I tried a smaller one at first but the screw was extremely difficult to attach.  Only when I used a 1/8" drill bit did it go in.
+1	We bought this gate for a opening between our foyer and kitchen. We ended up buying one extension and are very pleased!!! We put it together in about 30 minutes. It's great because you can bend it into whatever configuration you need. For us, we were hesitant to drill into our walls but didn't have another solution. Now that it's installed, we definitely feel like the safety and convenience factors far outway the problem of drilling into our walls.  I definitely recommend this gate!!
+1	I love this gate!  We have a spiral staircase that continues for 3 floors and it was almost impossible to block off on the second level.  This gate has solved all our problems.The door does not swing closed behind you, which I like.  The bar across the bottom of the door is very low compared to other gates, about an inch.  When the door is closed it is secure, much more so than our gate that swings shut behind you.  The entire system spans 72" and is very stable, even when my 1 year old shakes it.This gate is a great solution for difficult areas and is well worth the money.
+1	We have two landings where we use these gates and they work really well for them. The first one was a little tricky to install but the second was much easier to do. I love the magnetic latch because I know the gate will close every time. It can be difficult to open sometimes but I'd rather that than have it open too easily and have my child sneak through.
+1	We have a row home with very low banister.  I purchsed the Kidco Configure Gate along with the extension and it fits perfectly and wraps around the area nicely and doesn't take up too much room.  For the purpose I gave it 5 stars, but I did feel both the gate and extension were a bit pricey.  The gate is crafted well, easy to install, and the peace of mind is well worth it.
+1	We have used several other gates to block off the stairs in our home and have been frustrated with them all. My husband and I wish that we had ordered this gate a year ago! It was easy and quick for my handy husband to install at the base of the stairs. The gait opens easily with one hand (the trick is to pull the latch and then LIFT the gate just a bit, which we didn't know to do and initially caused us to think the gate was defective until reading the directions. This feature is nice as our toddler can pull at the latch but can't lift the gate to open it by herself). The gate is also fairly wide, allowing us to pass through it easily, even when carrying things. The gate automatically swings shut, which is convenient, but will also stay open if opened to 90 degrees. Would highly, highly recommend this gate!
+1	I run an in-home daycare in a townhouse in addition to having my own young children.This gate is by FAR the sturdiest gate I've used and it is my absolute favorite.  I have 4 different baby gates.  We used it in a previous home to surround the fireplace but have it in use for keeping children in the playroom across a large doorway now.The gate is attractive, too!  I don't feel like I'm keeping the children "trapped" like with other gates.My only issue is that my oldest daughter figured out how to open the gate at the age of 2.  However, by then she understood and obeyed when I told her WHY she couldn't go through the gate.This gate is also taller than the average baby gate, which I love for my 12 month old climber.  She stacked pillows and climbed over the first gate I installed in that doorway.
-1	The advertising for this gate made it seem like the right purchase for me, but I was wrong!  First, the hinges on the gate which allow you to place the panels at an angle are not wonderful.  If you're a little too forceful, it can easily break.  And if it breaks, you're out of luck with installing this gate.  Second, the mounting pieces for the wall are fixed position, at the top of every fence panel.  The wall mounts are not the same as shown in the Amazon picture, which is in the middle of the panel!  This became a problem for me because I have a window ledge that is lower than the wall mount location.  Third, this Kidco gate is clearly terribly overpriced.  Most people will have to buy extension gate panels to make this work and boy does the cost add up.  If you have an irregular shaped area or room that needs a gate, I'd recommend that you look into the North States 3 in 1 Super Yard Gate.  I bought this North States Gate with a total of 6 panels (12 feet) and it did not have any of the problems I just described.  It was expensive, but cost less than the Kidco.  Overall, it is sturdier and better made too.  The North States Gate can be placed at various angles too just like the Kidco.  North States Gate needs to amp up their advertising though because it isn't quite clear that it can do the same as the Kidco Gate at a better price too.
+1	We have been using this system for about two months now.  We have 2.5 walls in what was once our dining room (now play room).  We used 4-5 extensions as well.  We bought this new, and it was easy to set up.  Be sure you install it into the studs - infants will pull up on the railing.  Kidco is pretty easy to work with.  They sent me free "templates" for the wall and I bought some screws (for another gate).I LOVE this system.  The quality is great.  I recommend it and would purchase another if needed.
+1	We have really enjoyed having this since my son was born.  We do not use the heartbeat or music setting, but he seems to like the other two settings which are more 'nature oriented.'  I love the automatic shut-off and the voice-activated modes.We have gone through one set of batteries already, but it took seven weeks to do so.  (That includes a few nights/naps that I forgot to press the automatic shut-off)  Overall this is a great product and very useful.
+1	My daughter is now 11 weeks old, and we have used this since she was born.  We usually use the ocean sound, but once or twice we used the rainfall and she seemed to like that, too.  It's true that the lullabies sound mechanical, so we just don't use it.  We didn't buy it for music, anyway.  We wanted white noise to soothe her and block out other noises.We always use the voice-activated mode, and when we first put her down, we just go "shh" into it or snap fingers to start it, when it begins to play for about 15 minutes, and then whenever she cries.  It does take a pretty decent sound from her to set it off, but that's okay -- her softer noises are usually in her sleep anyway.  She only sets it off a couple of times a night -- I think!The biggest drawback is batteries.  Despite only using it on voice activate mode, when it's only on for 15 minutes at a time, we seem to have to change batteries about every two weeks.  We switched to rechargeables, and they seem to die even sooner -- but at least we can recharge them.  The unit runs through batteries even quicker if you use the night light -- even for only a few seconds to check on the baby.  This is hard for me to fathom, considering that our swing runs much more, and since our daughter was born, we have NEVER had to replace the batteries!
-1	Good while it worked! My baby really liked the sounds and the night light was great for midnight feedings. I only had it for three weeks when it stop working. I changed batteries thinking that was the problem but the next day it stop working again. It didn't play music and light would not turn off. I am really disappointed. Buyer beware!
+1	When I first had this product, I used it on my daughter's crib like it is intended.  Then I realized it could also be placed on the side of the carrying handle on most infant car seats.  I found it worked great if my daughter was fussy in the car.  She loved the soft sounds and musical melodies.  It helped lull her to sleep.  The added light is also a great feature to peak on her rather than turning on the bright overhead light in my car.  Just make sure it is placed securely on the side of the handle to prevent it from falling.
+1	The first crib they shipped me was damaged in the shipment, so I asked them to ship another one...the second one was also damaged...I was able to take pieces from both to make a useable one...It is a great crib! It folds up and can be rolled on it's wheels even when folded. It can be assembled very quickly. So I rate the item very high, but check out your product when you receive it because the FedEx guys really beat ours up!
+1	I purchased this crib after my son grew out of his Graco travel lite crib (at three months). My son is four months old now and fits in it perfectly and there is still a lot of room for him to grow. It is a nicely made crib and is worth the $80 that it costs. It is so cute and I love the fact that they sell a bedding set for it. We bought the malawi set for it, which looks adorable. I wish I would have gotten this crib from the begining.
+1	I love this changing table. This changing table has lots of space for keeping babies things handy.  You can put everything you need like diapers, rash ointment, powder, wipes tee shirts ,burp cloths on one of the shelves and still have room for a few toys. It has ample room to change and dress the baby without any problems.  You may want to get a thicker changing pad though. I have never had a problem with this and I used it for two kids.
+1	I bought this changing table with the matching Delta Jenny Lind crib from another store (shop around for the best price).  When they arrived, my husband and I set up the changing table first.  It was very easy for us to set up (although I think it would be quite difficult for just one person to do).  I did feel like the wood was going to crack at times, as in some places it must be strained to fit together while you tighten the screws, but it held up in the end, and is actually much sturdier than it looks like it is going to be when you take it out of the box.  Are there nicer, sturdier products out there?  Absolutely, but you're going to pay for the difference.  Overall, we are very pleased with the value of the product for the price.However, as a side note, the oak crib did not match its "matching" changing table.  The changing table is a nice reddish oak, while the crib was very blonde.  We took the items back to exchange for a matching set, only to receive another unmatched set.  Please be aware of the color differences if you are considering purchasing the set.
+1	this changing cover has worked well with our changing pad helded up in the wash from so many poopie diapers...which is a nice pad along with our changing pad (which we whip clean before use  and after use..over the pad its self (which sometimes my nephew sticks to without a oniez on!)
+1	The softness of this cover makes up for the fact that you have to stretch it a bit to fit your changing pad.  At least once you have it on, you know that it's a snug fit and won't pop off!
-1	I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).  They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.
+1	Recently, while on vacation I misplaced the membranes for my Medela Pump In Style Breastpump, which are vital for operation. The spare parts were safe at home, and with a hungry boy on my hands I was in a predicament.  Unable to nurse, I have provided my son with breastmilk by pumping three times a day since birth.  I was concerned about maintaining my milk supply, not to mention the discomfort of very full breasts, so I purchased the Isis Breastpump because I use Avent products and like the idea of being able to pump right into the feeding bottle, 4 oz, 9 oz or disposable. I am amazed by the comfort, control and power this little hand pump provides.  In addition, I enjoy the convenience of not having to be "plugged in" and the reduced amount of bottles to wash.  I found this pump to be great in a pinch, or for a weekend away.  However, for my particular situation having to express 30 ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy, the Pump In Style is superior to the Isis both in speed and quantity of milk expressed.
+1	I have been breastfeeding my son, since he was born, and now he is 9 months old. I couldn't have done it without this Avent pump. As a first time mother, I always knew I wanted to breastfeed my child, but it was a lot harder for me than I thought it would be. My son had trouble latching on in the hospital, and so, until he could breastfeed consistently (I went to a lactation consultant and she worked wonders), I was pumping my breast milk for him. At the hospital, they provided me with a Medela manual pump. It was PAINFUL. I eventually got calluses from pumping with the Medela pump. So then I was considering whether to buy the Medela electric or the Avent Isis, and I went for the Avent, a much more economical buy. This pump is so comfortable, it really imitates the suckling action of the baby. At first, all the parts might seem overwhelming, but when you put the pump together, it's a breeze and washes easily. I chose the disposable system because I thought it would be more convenient if I traveled to take the pump, however, I find I use the reusable 4 oz bottles a lot more frequently. Whether you're taking the pump on vacation,to work, to extract milk for an occasional bottle or to mix for cereal, this pump is a great buy. Now that my son is older, it is harder for me to pump so much milk (the let-down takes a little longer, and he drinks less, so I do have to pump a bit), but it's so convenient if you have to go out and run an errand, or freeze your milk so that you'll always have supply on hand for the babysitter.
-1	Had it not fallen apart after one wash, this would have been the perfect mattress pad.  It never even made it into the dryer.  What a waste of money.
-1	When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad. I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic. I can't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product, let alone sleep on it! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover. The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby.
+1	I own two of these mattress pads and I love them.  They help to make my extremely firm crib mattress a little cozier for my son.  They hold up very well in the wash and fit great over my Simmons mattress.  It is a little more expensive that other mattress pads, but in my opinion it is worth it.
+1	Unlike many other pads on the market, this one is very soft and durable. It holds up great to washing, fits my baby's mattress perfectly, and appears to be very cozy for my little one.
+1	This fits well and is so soft.  I haven't found it to be the best with waterproofing, though.
+1	I love it!  It keeps my sons mattress dry and it washes easily and comes out great. He has peed through his sheets twice so we have washed it 3 times and it is still in as good condition as when we bought it the week before he was born 9 weeks ago.  I will be getting another one soon.
-1	Don't waste your money!  Overpriced leaky bottles!
-1	I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had.  I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed.  I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts.  I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts.  Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?
+1	and I have still come back to them in the end as they have kept me from the dreaded nipple confusion. I rate them 2nd only to the Dr.Brown wide neck, and that is only because of the gas issue. They are super easy to break down and clean. And yes, I had the same problem with the nipple leaking at first. However, after a couple runs through the dishwasher and sometime just opening and reclosing the bottle, I haven't had the problems since.
+1	In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles.  I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable.  Well, they are.  They also have more nipple selections, depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle. I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz. cup holder, these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these, couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts (have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one).
+1	My wife chose Avent on recommendation from a friend and we glad we did.  These bottles worked perfectly for us.  They also fit right into Avent bottle warmer, which we also have.
-1	Avent bottles are not as great as all the write ups.  They allow to much air to enter the baby's system.  Spend your money on a better bottle like Dr. Brown's or Platex.  I know several new mother's who bought in the ad hype about these bottles and ended up trashing them and buying something else.
+1	I used these bottles with my first son and would have given them about 3.5 stars. I would be the first to tell you if they were not fixed just right they would leak. After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these. When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different. Oh, wow, what a diffrence. Baby is 4 months old and no leaks. The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar. Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks. The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content. I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn't leak a bit. The new nipples have the words "Extra Soft" on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom. I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned.
-1	My son is breast fed, but we have given him an occasional bottle. He refused these. I got them because of all the great things I heard about them. I thought it would be easier for him to switch back and forth. No chance. He hates them. He hate the Playtex disposables too. He now takes Gerber bottles, traditional and New Traditions.
-1	I spent SO much money on these bottles while I was pregnant, because they were supposively the best bottles to use while breastfeeding. The bottles are expensive so I thought they must be good bottles. WRONG. Expensive does not always equal good. I tried using these bottles when my baby was two weeks old, and the feeding session ended in complete frustration on mine AND my baby's part. The nipple shape is horrible. Even the newborn nipples are WAAAAAY too long for a newborn's mouth ( and my baby has a BIG mouth. He was 9 lbs at birth) . Not to mention that these bottles let him suck SOOOO much air and caused him to spit up several times. I thought maybe my baby was just having problems with taking a bottle, so I went and bought the Playtex VentAire. Those bottles are a LOT cheaper and SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better. He took the bottle immediately and didn't get NEARLY the amount of air.  Don't waste your money on these bottles. They are NOT the "best" bottles to use while breastfeeding. SO if you are pregnant, don't make the same mistake that I did and buy a whole load of these bottles thinking that they are the best.
-1	These bottles leak.  It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave.  They leak.  Terribly.  And Avent knows it.  They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent.  Of course the ones they replace it with also leak.  Buy Dr. Browns instead.
+1	I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent.
+1	These bottles are great. The entire line works together from breast pumps, to sanitizers, to storage containers, to sippy cups. Also, my son had no problems with colic. Not sure if this says anyhting about the "anti-colic nipples", but whatever.Here are some of the major comments I have:LEAKING-They only leak if you don't dry them completely or put the lid on wrong. They have leaked on me b/f but only occasionally when they are wet. I love these bottles.VARIABLE FLOW- There are several different grades of nipples. I love that there are slow flow, medium, fast and then sippy tops. They even have variable flow nipples so you don't have to buy three sets. A friend of mine uses different ones that only had two different flows and was envious of my choices!GROW WITH ME- The fact that the whole set is interchangeable is great. You can use these bottles from newborns to toddlers. You can convert your bottles into sippy cups!!! There are screw on handles and sippy tops you can buy. Fabulous. To me, this also justifies the cost.
+1	These bottles are absolutely fantastic! They are so easy to use and they cut down on gas wonderfully. I just cannot say enough good about them - well, here's an idea. I have 8 of them! The nipples can be a little pricey at times but check out the stores and babies rus - they're on sale at different times in the year and you can save about 15-20% on them. I wouldn't use anything else.  Target puts them on sale as well.  The silicone nipples are so much nicer than the rubber ones on regular bottles, and if you nurse and use bottles as a supplement, these are the more like yourself so the baby has an easier taking it.  The bottles withstand hundreds of washings in a dishwasher without the markings being washed off.  By far, the best bottle on the market in my humble opinion.  I received one in a gift set and my husband immediately ran out and bought a week's worth - they're just so much easier to use and they fit so well on the fridge shelves, plus those huge plastic caps that fit over the nipples are easy to remove and makes you feel like everything is cleaner.  Highly recommend!
-1	Avent bottles have more BPA than any other leading brand. BPA free brands include Born Free, Nurture Pure, MAM, Green to Grow, Baby Life and Adrini.(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful, especially to infants.)
+1	I have had 3 children, all formula fed from birth, and we only used this brand with the 3rd child - mainly because I could not find the brand I used previously (Canon Babysafe).Yes, they are more expensive, but if you think how many times you use them and wash them ... you certainly get your money's worth.  I only have 6 and this suits us perfectly.I have not had any trouble with leaks and find they seal quite well for outings when they are in my nappy bag.My baby took the teat from birth with no problems.  But I know some mother's who had babies that just wouldn't take this teat and they had to switch brands.  I guess with everything to do with babies it's a case of trial and error to find what suits you and your baby.What I like about the bottles is that the wide opening makes them extremely easy to wash and easy to put formula in.  I used the narrow necked bottles previously and I was forever spilling formula trying to put the formula in with the scoops.  The Avent bottles are also very comfortable for me to hold and easy for my baby to grip on to as well.They suit us perfectly - give them a try and see what you think.
-1	I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible. Don't waste your money.  Dr. Brown's is the way to go!
+1	I loved these bottles. Never had one problem. No leaks, nada one. I also was able to attach these to the ISIS breast pump. I only use these for baby water now, since I use larger bottles. 5 stars
+1	I had and hated the VENTAIR!  Stupid leaky valves!  This bottle feels nice in the hand to feed and my husband like them too.  The placement on the babys face with the nipple is perfect too.
+1	My daughter was born 3 & 1/2 weeks early and had to stay at the hospital for a week, she was lazy at the breast but did great with these bottles which came highly recommended by a friend.  I only have an ocassional problem with leakage when you twist it shut it seems that every 1 in 10 times it leaks.  I don't mind the leaking except that it takes several tries to re-twist it before it stops leaking.  I hate losing precious breastmilk to leaks, thats why I gave it only 4 stars.
+1	These bottles are pretty good.  The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby.  She makes quite a mess while drinking from these.  However, the bottle is nice and durable.  The nipple and caps fit snug.  Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers.  You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage.  I like that.  My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use.
-1	I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts, every one of them leaks. I tried everything to stop the leaks, but nothing worked. Avent makes a great manual breast pump, but they need to put a better bottle on the market.
+1	I like the bottles. Have only had trouble with leaking a few times when I had the cap to tight. You just have to take off the lid and start over. Good system.
+1	THEY HAVE A GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE, IN MY COUNTRY THE BUTTLE AVENT ARE SO EXPENSIVE, I LOVE TRADE AVENT
+1	Ever since the day my daughter got home from the hospital she has been using the Avent bottles. For a few days even the Stage 1 nipples were a little too fast for her, but she got used to it. She loves the nipple shape which is so much like my breast. In all actuality i like the bottle, but my little Aliya loves it. After introducing her to Avent she rejected most other bottles, she wouldn't even take the new Ventair bottles. A great product!
-1	I am extremely tired of having to clean up messes after feeding our twin sons with the Avent bottles.  Especially if we are out for a big event and the boys are dressed nicely.  The bottles worked great for the first six months and then.....THEY ALL LEAKED.  It was not a small leak rather, a pouring leak that soaked their shirts.  I hate these bottles and plan to switch!!!
+1	I absolutely love ALL Avent products... their bottles, bottle-warmer, pacifiers, etc.Both of my boy used the Avent bottles, and the ones my first-born used are still being used by my second one. Yes, sometimes there is a slight leak when shaking... I found that is from formula powder getting stuck between the nipple and the bottle, and breaking the seal. So, when it happens I just wipe the rim of the bottle, take the nipple out of the ring, rinse the nipple and ring, and then the problem's gone. These bottle seem virtually indestructible to me, and haven't discolored with age of anything. (Although, old nipples do discolor.)It's hard to believe my mom gave me bottles with little bags in side... what a pain and mess that must have been!!!
-1	when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples. well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window. my daughter had  very bad gas. when i switched bottles the gas stopped. Plus the bottles are  expensive......you  have to keep buying new  nipples there are sooo many different sizes. a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more.
+1	These are the best bottles ever! They are a little "pricey", but they are worth every penny. My baby gets very little air in her belly since we started with these bottles. They are heaven sent - my baby has a full happy little tummy!
+1	I admit it: I am impressed with Avent bottles! They are easily one of the baby products capable of handling extremes without a blink. Example: microwave sterilize them and after a couple of minutes, pour a stream of recently boiled water; mix with formula and put next to the ice bin in the freezer for five minutes. Do this with your average bottle a few times and be ready to say bye-bye to them, but Avent bottles hold on strong and in the process also happen to offer the best bibs in the market (the ones that best mimic the nipple, thus giving your baby the least gas, if you feed the bottle perpendicular to his/her mouth). No wonder they've been voted among the best baby products for several years in a row!
-1	My daughter liked the nipple but got to much air. I tried these and the Dr. Brown but ended up going back to Playtex Nursers(I used these with all my other kids) I wouldnt recommend these.
+1	Wonderful bottles, as our daughter won't use anything else.  Wish they were more narrow so she could hold them herself.  Occasional leaking when shaking milk around or mixing a bottle of formula.
-1	When breastfeeding, these are highly recomended. The problem with a breastfeeding mom is, they do not fit standard US breast pumps. So basicly you have to pump into one bottle, then transfer into this one (this causes a problem for those of us who don't produce quite enough milk --- every drop that is lost in transfer is crutial). Then you are faced with the leaking problem. The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking. Well, sometimes that works and sometimes it dosen't. Again, I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was. Sometimes these bottles will taunt you. I would test the bottle before giving it to baby... then after I was convinced it wouldn't leak... baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded! And there you are, wasted milk, and a hungry baby who is drenched, and really mad by the time you get another bottle ready and her clothes changed!!! The day I stopped breast feeding I switched to playtex vent aire, which only leak once in a blue moon, if you dont put it together right.
+1	This brand of bottles was recommended to me by a certified lactation specialist when I was having trouble with low breastmilk supply and was forced to supplement.  It was extremely important to me to be able to still feed my baby by breast and I was afraid that introducing a bottle to my daughter would cause her to lose interest in me.  I was told that this brand of bottles was created to closely imitate the breast and this is the only brand that you can easily switch baby back and forth from breast to bottle.  And it has worked wonderfully--my baby girl will feed from both without any problem.  I love the shape of the bottles--very comfortable to hold--and they are extremely easy to clean.  Out of the four 4 oz size bottles I own, one of them has a leaking problem, but I can usually solve it by loosening or tightening the cap.  My daughter has no problem sucking from the nipple, as one person reported.  These bottles are great!
+1	These bottles are superior to any on the market.  One of my daughter's had severe reflux and used the variable flow nipple so that she could have cereal in the bottle.  Avent is the only bottle company that offers this specific type of nipple, which was a life saver.  I tried using the Soothie bottles with my other daughter, because they were cheaper and she has no signs of reflux and I figured what the heck.  Wrong decision!  She ended up with a soaked face and bib every time.  Mind you, my little one is a health, full-term newborn with no latching problems.  So I switched back to the Avent bottles.  Feedings are now mess-free and pleasant!  As for the leaking issue, people should just take the time to read the directions.  Avent clearly states in their directions that if you over tighten the nipple ring onto the bottle, it causes the nipple to wrinkle and the bottle leaks.  The nipple ring just needs to be tight enough for the nipple to grab the bottle and seal.  It is specifically designed to do this.  It's not product error, it's user error.
+1	I am breastfeeding but feel the need to have a back up plan in case I need to leave so I tried the Avent bottles on the recommendation of my sister.  My 5-month old daughter took right to them.  No nipple confusion!  They are the best!  Now I can be assured that she will be able to eat without me there!
-1	My baby never wanted to take them, or when he did, he looked like he was going to choke (even with the newborn nipples!), and was doing a mess, with milk dripping everywhere. The Evenflo nipples were cheaper and better.
+1	I absolutely love these bottles!!  I've been using them for about 4.5 months now and I've NEVER had a problem with leaks!!!!  I have also never overtightened the bottles!!  I love how they are designed.  Because of their width, my daughter was able to hold them at 3.5 months!!  I also love their 'wide-neck', which makes it very easy to fill the bottle while holding a squirming baby!  They are also EXTREMELY easy to clean!  And they are interchangeable!!  I plan on buying the sippy cup spout in a couple of months so that my daughther can learn to drink from a sippy cup using the same bottle!!! My daughter has also never had colic!! I LOVE EM!!! I LOVE EM!!! I LOVE EM!!!  I also have the breast pump and microwave sterilzer which all fit the bottles perfectly!!
-1	these dont require that extra ring to make it leak proof. i had the originals and they work great too but i like the big capacity but not big size of these. they will leak out of the nipple if it is upside down so if your baby feeds themselves, watch that they dont drop it and wedge it somewhere upside downupdated review***** i love avent NATURALLY bottles and trusted that is what i was getting when i looked at all 12 customer photos. well i broke these babies out to use em last night and they are reg avent bottles with the stupid ring on the inside that makes it not leak(something not needed in the other bottle)the plastic used is also completely different. it isnt the hard clear plastic that doesnt cloud or stain, it is the dull non see through plastic that feels pliable. and the oz numbering on these reg bottles is the kind that will scratch and rub off easily. so disappointed that i now have to return these :(
-1	Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.  Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.  The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.  We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.  The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.  Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem.
+1	The Avent brand of bottles is an outstanding product.  For those experiencing leaks, it is simply because the bottles are an interlocking system and must be screwed on properly.  I have had no problems using these bottles, and yes I have experienced an occasional leak which I notice while I'm shaking the bottle because I have not screwed the cap on properly.  These are well worth the price paid.  I have tried both Dr. Brown's and Playtex VentAire and find the Avent products to be superior to both of these.  Highly recommended by this mom!Update March 06:  one more great feature about the Avent bottles -- they sell a sippy cap that can replace the nipple, so your investment goes into toddlerhood with no need to buy additional sippy cups!  They are leakproof, and come in a 2 pack just as the replacement nipples do.  I have found them in Toys R Us, since my local Babies R Us does not carry them.  Still a great product in my book!
+1	these are wonderful, they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets. no other bottle compites with avent!
+1	We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great. He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast. We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you. So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!
+1	A lactation consultant recommended these bottles to me. I bought one to make sure my baby liked it before buying more. I didn't want to hassle with the disposable liners. I feel my baby doesn't swallow as much air. A lot of babies are gassy and I wouldn't blame it on the bottle.  I also like the idea of the different sized nipples to adjust the flow.  I have only used size 1 because we need her to slow down; she eats to fast and gets a tummy ache.These bottles also fit perfectly in my bottle warmer (the first years) excellent choice!
+1	I have been using nothing but these bottles for the first 6 months of my baby's life. Yes they WILL LEAK if you don't pull the nipple all the way through. But that is an easy fix! I never had an issue with my baby falling asleep during a feeding or the flow being too fast. And colic has never been a problem here either.I breastfeed and pump for my baby and I found that she went easily from bottle to breast as early as 2 weeks old. I attribute it to the unique design of the nipple which encourages her to open her mouth wide instead of tucking her lip in to suck on a smaller nipple.Also these can be converted to sippy cups. They are very durable as well and so easy to clean. I threw all the other bottles I got as a shower gift right out in the trash - my baby will not drink from them.
-1	I bought this to use with my Avent bottles (which by the way LEAK) and I was very disappointed. My doctor told me to pump to stimulate my milk production which was coming in slowly. I could not get very much with this and needless to say it was not helping. Once I started using a Medela Electric pump, I got tons of milk! I was skeptical about the price, but it's totally worth it if you want to be able to use a pump on a regular basis.
+1	This is a great pump... forget about spending over $60 on something you are not sure you are going to use too much... NOT TO MENTION - now that I use this pump daily - I am still happy I did not spend the $260 for the 'Mack-daddy&quot; - this is comfortable and fast and easy to work with.
+1	I mostly use the Ameda electric, but used this on a weekend trip and was very pleased with the milk volume.  I get most of the milk in just a few minutes and the one hand operation is simple.Drawbacks: it can be tricky to get the suction going, but little pumps at first followed by long slow pumps will eventually get it. Also, I've found that I can still get milk out with my electric even after I'm done with the Isis.  It is a little higher maintenance to clean, but I still recommend it.
+1	This is a great pump. I haven't had any issues with it. I pump constantly as my son is very finicky as to when he wants a bottle or a breast in his mouth.  Easy to use and clean. The carrying case is great for when I go back to work and it can also be used as a carrying bag for keeping milk/formula cold when you go out.  While I love the pump I am not happy with the Avent Bottles. They can leak easily if you over or under tighten the bottle.  Let me tell you at three in the morning you dont' want to worry about that stuff.  You want to get a nipple on and feed.  I recommend the pump but not their bottles.  Sometimes if I put down the pump on the bed and it tips a bit I get spillage from where the pump connects to the bottle.
-1	I had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO idea..!!! I only recieved this pump - no electrical one and I wanted 2 diiiiie! I was in pain for days after I gave birth,irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern. I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke! I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you.. I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding... NOooooo! already, I would think... yes and with only 4 oz to show. Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump... NO.. I NOW know better.... electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300. and change its worth your sanity, sleep, time, energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby. My milk supply in time grew (not soon enough) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship. We started off badly
+1	This isis breast pump set is great. The only thing I have a problem with is the little noise it makes whenever I pump and it feels not private. Besides that, its very conviencent to use and easy. I think, since its plastic rubbing plastic it just makes the noise after awhile you pump.
+1	I am sold on the Avent Isis Breast Pump--it works great for me.  I nursed my 2nd child exclusively for 13 months, and I used this pump to express milk so that my husband could feed him.  He never really took on the bottle, but that's a different story.  Anyway, I just couldn't justify having to spend a couple of hundred dollars for a pump--maybe if I was working and wanted to continue breastfeeding, I probably would have.  But I was a stay at home mom and just used the pump to express every now and then.  I had no problem expressing 4 ounces of milk in about 10 minutes, and it didn't hurt either--it actually felt comfortable.  I had the Evenflo electric pump for my first child--now that one was very uncomfortable--it felt like it was sucking the life out of you.  Maybe it was me being a first time mom, but I swore off that pump.  I still nursed my first child for 13 months but not exclusively--he got both breastmilk and formula.Now, I am on my 3rd child.  I figured after having such an easy time breastfeeding my 2nd child, it would be a piece of cake the 3rd time around.  Well, it wasn't.  She did not latched on properly and I got really sore within the first couple of days.  But I did not want to give up breastfeeding, so I purchased another one of the Avent Isis Breast Pump, because I wanted to help increase my milk supply.  It worked and I got to breastfeed again exclusively--my baby wasn't getting frustrated anymore because my milk supply increased.  Then when she was 6 weeks old, I had to leave her (unexpectedly) to attend my father's funeral in California.  I couldn't take her with me--she was too young.  I was gone for 3 days, and I did not want my milk supply to dwindle down, so this pump helped a lot.  I was able to express some before I left so she would have some breastmilk along with formula supplement while I was gone.  And then I pumped while I was gone--I did it on the plane restroom and airport restrooms very discretely, and I was done in about 15 minutes at a time.  And because it is manual, I was able to express whenever and whereever I needed to.  This helped me  keep my milk supply while I was gone so when I got back, I just continued on like I was not gone.  Thanks Avent.
-1	If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon, then this is a great pump for you.  I found it to be an incredible nusance, so I borrowed a friend's Medela electric pump.  Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers!  Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to (and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise).  With our next child, I will definitely be buying electric!
+1	Being a stay-at-home Mom, I don't need to pump frequently, but when I do pump, this item is terrific!  Easy to use.  I'm able to pump a 4 oz. bottle in 5 minutes.  I suggest using it without the let down massage cushion.  It works better for me without it.  Easy to clean and case makes storage easy.
+1	The Avent pump in this kit is very good. I also like the carrying bag, which is subtle and good for work - it can even be used as a lunch box when you are done breastfeeding.However, the nipples in this kit are very hard and the speed on the slow flow was far too fast for my newborn (when I tested the milk on my wrist, I didn't get a drop - it squirts). There are better bottles out there too, that keep the baby from getting too much air. Instead of the Avent bottles, I have started using the Playtex nurser system - which means I pump into the Avent bottles and pour them into the nurser (the Playtex system sells a kit with a pump adapter - but it does not work with Avent). This has worked fine for me, though if I were not pumping at work I would not pay the extra money to have the kit. Since I pump at work, the insulated bag is helpful.
+1	I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my "let down" and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009.
+1	When my son was put in the NICU, he immediately stopped nursing.  I'm assuming it was due to the stress.  While I was at the hosptal, I used their Ameda Elite hospital pump, but at home, I was pumping full time with this pump.  It gets the job done quickly and the handle is very comfortable.The milk can leak out the sides, which can be very upsetting, especially if you're pumping for a hospitalized newborn and you need every drop you can get.  You just have to make sure to keep the pump perfectly upright.  Don't tilt it at all!I didn't have any problems with creaking, and if I did, I'd just take it apart and put it together and the problem was solved.I also know some had problems with the milk getting backed up and the silicone star not letting the milk flow to the container, but you just have to be sure to release the handle completely so the milk can flow out.  Another way to get it into the container is the break the suction between the pump and breast and pump the handle a few times.This pump worked great and I was able to come up with ways to avoid problems until I had used it (full time) for a month and a half.  The star would start getting sucked up into the top even if I slightly pumped the handle.  I emailed Avent and they emailed me back and had some great tips (great customer service, by the way!).  They said to boil the silicone parts for 10 minutes in water and 2 teaspoons of white vinegar... and viola! Problem solved.  If you use it as much as I did, the tackiness of the silicone wears and has to be fixed by the boiling.Lastly, I read some had problems getting everything to fit in the bag.  It takes talent, I tell you!  My advice is this: Remember how it was packaged in the first place!  Before you take it out of the bag, take note of how it's arranged.  After several attempts, I finally got it all back in.All in all, it's a great pump if you don't want to invest in an electric pump, or if you're only pumping occationally and you work around some of the little issues.  In those instances, I'd definitely recommend it!  I have an Ameda Purely Yours as well, and overall, I'd suggest paying the extra money and get an electric if you're working or having to pump full time, or you just want more convience.I hope this review helps, as I wanted it to be my best, considering all the experience I've had with so many pumps!
+1	Two of my friends used this one daily and recommended it to me. One of them went back to work and bought Medela just for pumping at work. I simply got this set to use both at home & work, and am I glad that I didn't need electric pump to express milk quickly - with ISIS, I can get 1 oz foremilk in less than a minute! Of course it takes a little longer for hindmilk because the pressure from the breast is less by then. On average it takes less than 10 minutes to pump 4-5 oz.I was back to work 2 weeks ago & have been using it twice a day. Before this I used it 1-2 times a day to pump a ounce or so foremilk for 6 weeks, and it works very well for me. All the parts are sturdy. You just have to make sure that you don't turn the connecting "neck" while pumping, else you'll drop the bottle!The numerous parts are a little daunting to assemble in the beginning, but you'll be an expert in no time. Just be careful with the little white valve when washing the parts, without it the pump won't work. But the kit does have extra valves.The insulated carrying bag is attractive and discrete. There's even a non-transparent drawstring pouch for storing breastmilk-filled bottles in the common fridge at work where everyone keeps their lunches! The included bottles, nipples etc represent extra values.I'm extrememly pleased with this Avent product and have also bought Avent Microwave Express Sterilizer in which the ISIS pump parts can be sterilzed.Jan 3,2003: I've been working full time and nursing for the past 4.5 months using Isis exclusively. I'm so happy to report that it's been working great for me without any problems at all. My now 6.5 month old daughter is at a healthy 65 percentile.
+1	it's THE best item you can buy! practical, easy to carry, easy to store.maybe, it should come with 3 9oz bottles and 1 4oz, instead of 2 and 2; becuase babies rapidly start needing more and more...also all mags that come with these items are great, with great tips, some of them are not even included in m. stoppard's book! very useful.i STRONGLY recommend this item!
+1	I pump just as fast from this pump as I do from the electric hospital grade one that I rented for the first month! Of course, you can only pump one side at a time, but I actually like haveing the other hand free to read or email.The AVENT instructions say that some users can use the pump without the "cushion." I did it this way first because when I was putting it together I did not see the petal cushion. It worked great. When I later found the petal cushion, and tried it - the pump did not work as well for me. So if you are having problems with the pump try it without the cushion. I think it has something to do with your size and the suction as to which works best. The hospital grade electric pumps did not have cushions, so that was what I was used to anyway.My only complaint is that the star vaulve is annoying. It sometimes falls out - while pumping and suction is lost and you have to take the whole thing apart to put the star vaulve back in. For this reason, I like the cheapo Medela hand pump a little better.But for all you out there deciding between electric and manual - I am one user telling you that I get EXACTLY the same results with this manual as with an electric. (4 to 6 ounces in 15 to 20 minutes)
+1	I bought other more expensive racks. This one is the best. Simple and goes with all kitchen decor, love it.
+1	This thing is pretty good for a bottle drying rack, comes with a little shelf for drying nipples, Sturdy, drains well, allows you to make different configurations in consideration of your bottle sizes. I like the size because it isn't huge butcan dry several bottles. COmes with a kinda flimsy bottle brush, will be a back up. Good product.
+1	This is small, sturdy, and great for the price.  It takes up minimal space on the counter yet holds all my bottle pieces and accessories and then some.  I would recommend this over some of the fancier ones.  It does the job well.
+1	Sticks well and comes with a bunch of additional adhesive stickers.
+1	I have purchased what feels like 100 ft of this stuff to protect my son who is quite a climber and runner.Overall I would say this is the best stuff but loses on star because sometimes that double sided sticky tap doesn't stick right.But you can't go wrong and should buy this to give yourself some piece of mind
+1	I have only owned this for a few days but I love it so far. It's very cushion-y and very soft. It has already prevented my child from a scrape. It comes with a bunch of different sizes of tape as well. Its double sided and seems to be holding up.
+1	I would have been okay with just the table corners. I have a glass table and I was worried about my 1-year-old niece visiting.The corners helped a lot as did putting a tablecloth over my table. There was no way the table guard was going to work around my glass table even with the tape included though. It's for a much thicker table and my glass table was too thin.Also, my niece is still crawling so the guard wasn't necessary. Even when she stood up, she couldn't reach the table and she was safe as houses in her booster seat and high chair.
+1	I have used it on both a glass-topped table & wooden crib. It was easy to put on & has been very durable, despite the best efforts of my very active 1 year old!  Very functional & economical.
+1	Easy to apply, stays on, and is perfectly cushioned for protecting little heads (and also great for teething!) Make sure your table is clean, you might even want to go over the edges with rubbing alcohol. If your table is dirty, it won't stick as well! I've seen some reviews saying that it's not very attractive... of course it isn't! That's not what it's made for. We love this, and highly recommend it!
+1	Nice bumpers. Very soft and easy to place. The only down fall is that they may be too soft. My daughter stood up to it and but a chunk off the day after we put it up!
+1	I like it. It is nice. It sticks nicely. and soft. Not worried about baby's head hitting the table anymore. Thank you.
+1	My crazy bruiser has made this probably the best baby purchase I made.  Doesn't come unstuck like the crappy clear one I tried before.sticks to my wood coffee table and glass trim on tv stand.Haven't tried to take it off yet so I don't know what that's going to be like but it was def worth it.
+1	We LOVE Prince Lionheart products.  We decided to get the edge guards.  This are awesome around our coffee table, end tables and entertainment center.  The are soft and fit perfectly.
+1	I used this product on our fireplace to cover up the sharp edges but it doesn't stick very well to natural stone.  So occasionally I have to re-stick it once it comes loose. Other than that it looks great and helps protect my baby from injury.
+1	Very cushioned.  They stick fairly well, but a toddler could peel them off if motivated.  I'm not wild about the brown color, but this is a case where the safety and thick soft material outweighs my aesthetic sense.  We have even used this around a rock fireplace base and it stayed stuck.  The longer guard is easy to cut for whatever length is needed.  I've reordered and used this product for two houses and I will reorder again if I ever need more.
+1	Just installed in on my coffee table and it is not an eyesore! It really blends in at the same time that protects my son from the sharp corners. Will be buying more to apply to the underside corners and the leg corners - for some reason my son keeps hitting his head on every corner possible!
+1	This edge and corner set is a great value. We started with just corners and found we missed a lot of other dangerous areas, including a knee-high tall toy chest with thick drawers. This set was perfect to secure the entire thing. It was easy to trim and apply. I prefer the gray to the chocolate for lighter woods. Its sort of a cement tan color. Its very dense foam, so if you press down pretty hard you still wont feel sharp edge. Good product.
+1	We  have used  this edging  and corners  on several  pieces of furniture.  It serves it purpose well.  However, our son just started pulling  the trim  off so we  have  had to replace the adhesive a few times.  Overall a  good product.
-1	The title says it all...the edges of the bumpers were very tempting for my daughter to peel every chance she got. You'd think her ability to remove the ends of the bumpers would indicate the bumpers would be easy to remove.They were a nightmare and have ruined our beautiful coffee table. I've tried goo gone to no avail. If anyone has any tips how to get the tape off, which is coated with random pieces of foam from the old bumpers, I'd love to hear them. I can't believe how awful my table looks.
+1	We have a raised stone hearth fireplace. It was the greatest feature of our family room until we had a baby. It is super easy to put on, works really well and I KNOW we would have had lots more tears, bumbs, cuts, bangs, etc. if this wasnt on our fireplace. We've also used it on some other wood furnture and it works well.
+1	Other reviews have said that this product is difficult to cut, but I used a pair of ordinary scissors and didn't have any problem whatsoever. Also, the foam is a bit stretchy, so your measurements don't have to be exact. I cut the foam a bit short and then just stretched it to fit. While it's true that the tape won't last forever, it is also true that it won't leave a mark on your furniture once you want to remove it permanently. Simply apply more double-sided tape when the adhesive breaks down. Easy!
+1	Good quality but it only covers the top part of the corner so it is still dangerous for baby to get up.
+1	A lot of reviews say that the stickiness of the tape isn't that great, and it isn't- but so far it's not a problem. The guards are great because we have a fake stone fireplace so the edge is much more uneven than brick, but the guard works great. A definite for anyone with a fireplace and a squishy little handful of a baby :)
+1	We purchased these edge guards just to be cautious but, once my son became mobile, we were thankful for these edge guards. Our son has clipped his chin, run around corners and hit his head and even bit the sides of the furniture when teething. What a great baby proofing item.
+1	I got this set to edge our stone hearth, and the color is a nice neutral beige/taupe. The adhesive has stood up to 18 months of abuse by my toddler and pre-schooler. No lifting or peeling. The seams blend nicely together where the corners and straight pieces meet, and its discreet and doesn't scream &#34;BABY PROOFING!&#34; Highly recommended.
+1	This worked perfectly for our fireplace.  It fit snugly and firmly.  There was plenty of adhesive tape for the entire length, which I know was a concern for other similar products.  The coloring was a nice neutral match as well.
+1	Provides the right amount of cushion. My son was pulling up on furniture by 5 months but was very clumsy. This product was great and came with lots of strong double sided tape.
+1	We have a big fireplace and this fit it, with some left over.  It's easy to install but, keep in mind that your baby can easily pull this off of whatever it's attached to but, you don't want something that is going to stay on forever.  Great product, Great price!
-1	I don't understand why they would make a product that does not fit standard corner tables! I need to return this item
+1	Shipped in nice original box.Four corner plus the long strip - as described.A nice touch is the double-sided-tape is 3M and not some cheap fall-off-next-week tape.
+1	I'm just worried for when i need to remove it! I might be purchasing new tables?  I even used it on a wall corner near the play area.  Stays fine. My son even tried chewing on it w his new sharp teeth. It held up. He was not able to puncture it!
+1	I got this when musings started crawling so I would be ready when he started walking and I'm glad I did. This product works great on my entertainment center and my lower window sills. The product sticks great and my little one can't pull them off. Just this morning he walked over to the window and fell and hit his head on the sill and he didn't get hurt. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with little ones.
+1	This edge guard is very easy to put on and sticks very well. Its very soft as well. Would recommend.
+1	We used this for our fire place. There is a raised seat and we used two of the corners and covered the edges. So far it has stuck well and I feel so much better not having to worry about our little guy falling into the sharp edge. Our fire place is tile and the color blends in well!
+1	We use this on the bottom edge of our coffee table because the baby loves to crawl underneath and then he hits his head on the way out.  This sticks well and he really has not hurt his head since we put it on.  It does the job!
+1	I have an espresso wooden rectangular coffee table.  I bought two sets of these and they are working perfectly!  They come with 3M adhesive tape and attach securely.  For some reason, even when I measure and lay out the tape carefully the strips always were cut a little too short so I had to cut a few filler pieces for the spaces between some of the corners and the edging.  I applied the edge guard on both the top of the table and the lower table that sits close to the ground.My little one was making us so nervous from hitting her head on this thing before so now we don't have to sit there with our hands over the corners when she plays around it!  I know she will fall and bump her head from time to time but I think this could help prevent a serious accident.  When I googled some babyproofing options for coffee tables I read a lot of stories about some really gory coffee table accidents so I do think this is worth it even if they aren't the most attractive thing in the world!
+1	I bought this for multiple purposes and it worked perfectly for all. The only con is that it is a bit pricey.  Overall, definitely worth the price.-Corner pieces used separately on corners of tables without the longer strips:  This doesn't look great but compared to the other clear plastic or silicone corner pieces I have much greater piece of mind with these.  They are soft enough that when my 18 month old hits his head directly on the corner he doesn't even flinch.-Long strips both with and without the corners used on table edges and on my bottom step:  I have a ledge/stoop inside my house near the backdoor and it has sharp metal edges nailed in along the entire length.  It makes a bend so I needed these strips to stick to metal on a step and not come off when we hit the edges or my son slides down on his rear.  This works like a charm.The edges have not peeled off metal, it was extremely easy to install and there was more than enough tape strips/squares given.  The double stick tape makes application quick and easy.I would highly recommend this product.*FOR A CHEAPER but not so pretty ALTERNATIVE:  Head to your local home improvement store and get pipe covers/insulation which are foam and come in varied sizes.  THey have a precut slit down the length so you can open it up and slide it on the edges of tables.  You'd need to tape it somehow but each strip is long and costs less than a dollar.  I covered a large coffee table for around $3 and some blue painters tape.
+1	My only big gripe is that they are stingy on the adhesive you can just get all your edge guard on with the adhesive. Just dont waste any part of the adhesive it is precious. But once on it wont come off easily even by a prying little hand it take quite a effort.If you use the adhesive on the edge of the guard that makes sure kids cant take of easily. It become furniture. I bought two of this in light and dark for different furniture when my kid was 7-8 months old.And i can vouch that this tape has avoided a handfull of accidents.CautionThe paint(especially wall paint) can come off when removing it.Once off any surface it doest stick again.Apply after you kids go to sleep needs some time to have a firm fix and so that they dont know it can be taken off.Also would add taht applying this when the child is young gives better chances that they stay on.Also Matching color should help being noted by children But you know all kids are different ;)
+1	This blends well with our coffee table and kept my little one safe. The real test will be when we take it off - will it peal off the wood from the furniture ?
-1	You know when you're child free and buy great furniture? You can't fathom the day when you'll have to apply foam to your beautiful wood table so your child doesn't go head first into the sharp corner?  Those days are now a distant memory and you bite the bullet and apply a foam guard.  Then you go to take it off because your child has spilled parmesan cheese and... what...the? The wood came off.  The WOOD came off.  I expected to have to use some Goo-Be-Gone to get off the adhesive but this actually destroyed the table.  Not like a dent that could be sanded.  I piece of wood literally splintered off.  So, while this product will protect your kid's noggin, don't put it on a piece of furniture you like.
+1	my baby has been not intrigued enough to pull this out. I have it even on the wall corners in my house. It has given me more peace of mind to let him walk without worrying too much.I have brown ones on my wood so it looks better.
+1	These have a nice amount of cushioning to protect my 9 month old daughter as she &#34;cruises&#34; around our coffee table.  They come with a good amount of adhesive tape, which is why I purchased this brand over others.  It is difficult to get them to stay adhered without putting adhesive tape on BOTH sides.  Once I put it on both sides, it works much better.  Because this item is also a bit &#34;stretchy&#34; it was tricky to measure it exactly right.  So, we have small gaps between the pieces which aesthetically isn't great, but it still protects my daughter.  If I had the time and money, I might purchase again and install it better knowing what I know now, but it works fine.
+1	Clean your coffee table or whatever well for the sticky to stick especially on a round glass table top. Protects the kiddo's noggin pretty well!
-1	When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child, however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it doesn't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to.  (I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table).Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes (must be completely flat to hold at all)
+1	My daughter's bed had sharp edges and she once bumped her head pretty bad and didnt want to sleep in her bed anymore. So I brought this to resolve that issue and prevent further damage-- works well.
+1	So far, my 9 month old hasn't tried to pull this off.  It seems pretty stuck with the tape they gave you.  It has stuck really well onto our fireplace (which is small, square, not totally even tile) for 2 weeks now.  This brand is MUCH better than the Cosmos brand, also sold here on Amazon.  The corners fit better, and the tape works a lot better.
+1	This comes highly recommended in my family.  My brother used these for my nephews and keeps them on things because his niece (my daughter) is now toddling about.  I like them, they don't hurt your furniture (don't sue me if they hurt yours, but they didn't hurt mine or my brother's).  This is often the difference between a quizzical look and a meltdown.
+1	Needed this item for our brick fireplace and decided to give it a shot despite some saying that the double sided adhesive tape didn't work well.  I assumed we would try it and then rig something else up (velcro, etc) if it didn't work.  It has been one month and the included adhesive tape is working very well.  My 11 month old goes up to it and tries to chew it (for all the chew toys that child has?!) and it stays put no problem.  Time will tell how long it lasts, but I am happy with the density of the edge guard and how well it went on that even if I did have to do some reworking of the adhesive in the future I would still be happy with the quality of the edge guard as well as the safety the product provides.
+1	This edge guard worked out pretty well for our needs. Since we have an old, beat-up coffee table, it didn't really affect the looks of our furniture much. Baby was able to pry off the corner edges after just a month or so (of course, the corner edges are where she hurts herself mostly). And it does leave behind some pretty substantial sticky bits when it comes off, I've just been too lazy to clean it up with anything yet. Overall a good investment.
+1	soft foamy, with double side tape.  seems a bit old perhaps, because when I unroll it the foam is showing stress marks from being rolled up too long, and appears to crack from being dry rot?  but it'll do for now.  lets see how long it lasts.
-1	I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable "chucks" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable.
+1	This works well with the contour changing pad.  It fits a little snugly, so the corners of the pad don't exactly stay as "pointy" as they were when it was new, but it works very well.  It works even better if you cut the straps off the changing pad.  You're right there with baby, anyway.
-1	Great colors, and I like Simmons' contoured changing pad, which this is supposed to fit, but keep in mind that washing will significantly shrink the covers &amp; the terry fabric doesn't hold up well. After just a couple of months, ours are already coming apart.
+1	Very convenient - I have a one year old and I babysit a one year old. I'm definitely not going to spend 100 bucks or more on a double stroller, but since I found two umbrella strollers on sale for 10 bucks each, my double stroller was only 30 bucks! It handles well. When you put the connectors on, make sure they're tight, and even so it will seem like there's too much slack for it to really move, but it does work. Just give it a go. :)
-1	do not waste your moneyi got it and i tried with  2 strollers the same exact one but it would not work goodyou can not  move that much and its hard to make a turn......
+1	I was a bit hesitant to buy this booster, although it came highly recommended.  I felt like it was overpriced and essentially offered nothing...boy, was I wrong!  I've been using this booster for 2 years now.  It has been used by my 3.5 year old and his 2 year old brother.  Both of them LOVE it.  The seat is comfortable for them to sit on, unlike the hard plastic seat we had before it.  It doesn't slide around on the chair, and it is SO easy to clean.  I also like that it is easy to take along if we're headed to grandma's house.  No extra straps, trays, or pieces to worry about! I don't have a single complaint with this seat after 2 years of use...it is well worth the money!
+1	My 16 month old daughter has gotten to the stage where she no longer wants to use a highchair or any of those other booster seats with the trays (ie. Tot-Loc, First Years 4 in 1 feeding seat, and First Years Folding Booster...all great products by the way)  She really just wanted to sit at the kitchen and dining room table like a big girl, and she didn't want to sit in the baby seats that allow you to convert them to big kid boosters by removing the trays.  We were at our wits end and after reading all the reviews here, we decided to give it a try, but I must admit we were a bit skeptical and nervous using this for our daughter because she is so young and most of the other reviewers said they used this for an older child.  Well our daughter absolutely loves this and is so proud of her upgrade from highchair to big kid comfy booster.  The booster wipes clean very easily, sticks to the chair very well, and the seat itself is non-slip, so our daugher does not slouch and side off this seat like she did with other hard plastic boosters.  Best of all, the seat brings her to the perfect height at our table (much better fit than the hard plastic boosters) and she appears to be much more comfortable (not to mention our once picky eater is now happily eating everything she sees now).  This booster seat seems to have completely changed the way my daughter looks at meal time for the better.  Also, the travel case this booster comes with is a nice touch, and it has room to pack a bib or small snack as well as the booster.  We're looking forward to using this booster for the next couple of years, and since it's so portable, we only need to buy one and just take it everywhere we go.One thing I should mention, I wouldn't buy this booster for a child who is overly active and doesn't like to sit still.  My daughter has no problems sitting still for extended periods as long as she is occupied, but if she were the kind of kid who always has to be moving at this age, I wouldn't use this booster just yet as it does not have any safety belt to hold your child in.
+1	My 2 1/2 year olds highchair was terrible, so I threw it out on his first b-day. This chair is great, but I dont see anything miraculous going on.PROS-* Very comfortable, my son always says everything should be like cooshie* All one solid piece of foam, bo creveces to get food stuck in* It doesnt slip due to the material, a plus for a wiggly toddler* Sits him up high enough to eat* Can be easily taken off, no straps and all that stuff* Cute color, not bright and pastely* Very light weightCONS-* Is not at all portable, I dont know about you but I wouldnt want to "travel" with something the size of a large platter everywhere!* The "carry case" is cheap and really the size of a diaper bag... uhh sorry I already have one of those* leaves his feat dangling, although this is a problem occuring in MANY booster seatsThis is just a booster. I like it and I am glad I chose it but I dont really understand the amazing changes in children with a booster (not that I am denying the fact that those reviews are true) I just dont see how this cooshie could do it. My son is still fussy, and will get down when he feels like it, this comfortable booster doesnt stop him. He loves his booster and loves being a big bow v.s sitting in a highchair like his little brother
+1	We love this booster. My 3 year is still using it and I think he started using it around 18 months or so. We have solid oak chairs and didn't have the problem of other reviewers. It sits in the same chair almost all the time and there's no residue. Maybe it has more to do with the chair finishing. Your chair does need to be made of something to "grip" this chair, such as a wooden chair. I tried to take it to my dad's house and he has cooshy leather chairs, and it didn't work. It cleans extremely easily, holds him securely, and works better than I could have expected.
+1	I must have a newer version because mine stick just fine.  I have very sharp corners on the bottom of my kitchen counters and these guys do the job.  They are so much thicker and cushionery than the other versions (pricey though), but I think they're worth it.  No more bumped heads!
-1	They don't seem to stick very well.  Also, once they did start to come off, I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table.
+1	I'm not judging anyone else, but I was very surprised when I read how many people wrote about these coming off or being pulled off. I guess my daughter never tried very hard, but they are really stuck tight. I've had one set for about 14 months, and bought a 2nd set for another table about 8 months ago, and they're not going anywhere.  I can't speak to them hurting the finish of the wood, since I've never tried to take them off.  They don't look too bad either, since the dark color matches most of my furniture. I do wish they came in more colors for some of my lighter wood.
+1	When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1.
+1	I put this on the corners of my brick fireplace and sticks well.  My one year old son tried pulling on it once and without success and never tried again.  They are large with good cushion and will do its job.  The adhesive is strong enough and after 3 months, they are still there on all three corners.  I would recommend but of course, if your child is persistent, I am sure he/she would get it off eventually. So far, so good.
+1	I really like this CD player.  I do not understand why it has such a low review.*Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light.  It is a nightlite.  It is just fine.  I can check on baby and see him fine.*The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine.  I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep.*The timer function if great.*The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up.  It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out.  Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this.*As far as the CD's ckipping when hit, I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib.  No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip.***It is not perfect but it does the trick!***
-1	This item is not top quality.  I don't have too many of this company's other products, so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will.  First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached, the batteries only lasted through two cd's, the volume doesn't get very high, and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib.  Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same.  You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's.
-1	What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!
+1	We've tried several different potty seats and this is the best by far:1)  Fairly easy to clean, integrated design.  Love that it wipes clean if it gets messy2)  Built in pee guard for boys...  We had another seat with a snap on attachment, and of course it got lost while our daughter was using it.3)  very sturdy and stable on toilet.  This seat positively sits on the toilet, and my son is comfortable on it for even long periods of timeWe tried the soft plastic ones, and ironically he complained a lot more about those being uncomfortable than this one.  Highly recommended!
+1	Fits on most seats with minor adjustment. Once set it is one hand operation especially for the times when you are running with the kid in one hand. My daughter likes to do it herself and it is very easy for her to do so. It not heavy in case the finger gets in between the seat.
+1	Fits perfectly on our toilet and is easy for our 23-month-old daughter to sit on securely. She can even put it on the toilet herself.
+1	We've tried a few different brands of potty seats, and this is by far our favorite. It stays in place when kids climb on and off instead of slipping or tipping like some other seats. Unfortunately we changed our toilet seat/lid combo to one of those slow close plastic ones that has the removable hinges for easy cleaning, and the Baby Bjorn training seat doesn't fit it. Also, after about three years (and a couple of kids) the black rubber handle on the back started to break, but I consider that minor wear and tear. Overall, I'd recommend this seat above others on the market. It safe and looks nice.
-1	While I think it's a great fit for the toilet, my daughter won't sit on it for more than a couple minutes, having to adjust every few seconds because she says it &#34;isn't comfy&#34;.  After the great reviews and was actually recommended to me by my sister, it just doesn't work for our daughter.  I'm going to have to buy a cheap padded one I guess.  Stinks that I can't return this thing. Pretty expensive.
+1	this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not. It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat. The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling. we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling.
+1	It fits my toto oval shape toilet bowl, I like it! And my baby loves to put it on the toilet bowl and sits on it.
+1	i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old, and we've reduced the number of diapers significantly, with very rare #2 diapers, woohoo!!! of course i had to hold the baby, but at 11 months, holding is discouraged. there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip, but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets, though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly. (but then if your kid isn't too young, you probably won't need a trainer for a small toilet.) i even take this to other people's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training, and this product enabled me to accomplish that.
+1	I like this toilet seat. It keeps his little butt out of the toilet. He likes it, too.Good for boys, no spray. Looks nice. Cleans easy.
+1	I love this seat. I have two in my house and this one is my favorite. The kids say it's comfortable and it adjusts to fit the seat. Which is great, since we actually have a round seat in one bathroom and an oval one in the other. I keep this one in the main bathroom, since it's the favorite. Definitely recommend this to anyone who has smaller butts (you know, children) in the house.
+1	We bought a couple of stand-alone potty seats a few months ago when our daughter was about 20 months old.  Although she was mildly intrigued by them at first and quickly learned what they were for, she seemed to view them more as glorified chairs rather than places to do her business.  Now that she's nearing the two-and-a-half year mark, we decided to buy a toilet trainer seat to see if that would get her more engaged in the potty training process.  After reading tons of potty seat reviews, I decided to purchase this BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer, since it's one of the few on the market that's made of BPA-free, non-toxic polypropylene plastic instead of toxic PVC or vinyl.  As an added bonus, this toilet trainer seat is fully adjustable to fit practically any size toilet seat.  We have oval-shaped, elongated toilet seats in our home, and the BabyBjorn potty seat fits them perfectly.  This toilet trainer doesn't slide around at all on the toilet seat, which helps my little-one to feel more secure while sitting on it.  Despite the exact fit, the toilet trainer seat is so easy to put on and remove that a preschooler could probably do it unassisted.  There's a handy loop at the back of the seat so that you can hang it nearby for easy storage.  (We hang it on aPotty Hookthat hooks over our toilet tank).As I said in the title of this review, the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer would be just about perfect, if only it had handles for little-ones to hold onto.  Apparently, when toddlers first begin to use the "grown-up toilet," many of them experience an innate fear of falling in, even when using a potty seat insert like this one.  Handles can help alleviate this fear by giving them something to hold onto to anchor themselves while sitting on the potty seat.  This was the case with my daughter.  When sitting on this toilet trainer seat, she couldn't relax enough to urinate, much less have a bowel movement.  She would either hold my hands or grab onto the sides of the (unsanitary) toilet seat in order to steady herself, but even then, she still couldn't relax enough to do her business.  On a hunch, I tried theArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary, which is one of the few polypropylene potty seats that has handles.  The first time we used that seat, my daughter immediately grabbed onto the handles and peed for the first time in the toilet!  However, the Arm & Hammer potty seat is too small for my elongated toilet seat, and it's not adjustable, so it constantly slides around when my daughter is on it.  And unfortunately, none of the adjustable potty seats that are readily available on the market (the BabyBjorn, Pourty Flexi-Fit and Prince Lionheart WeePod), has handles.I thought we were doomed to be stuck with the ill-fitting Arm & Hammer potty seat until I came across a nifty product called the "SHANDLE". The Shandle is a handle that sticks to the underside of your toilet seat with a strong, moisture-proof adhesive strip.  It's intended to help little boys avoid touching the germy toilet seat by providing a more sanitary grab-handle for lifting and lowering the seat.  But the Shandle has turned out to be a perfect solution for us to the problem of using the handle-less BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer seat.  We just stuck a Shandle on each side of our toilet seat (around the same place that our daughter would grab onto the toilet seat), and voila!  She had two, secure handles to hold onto to anchor herself has she used the toilet trainer seat.  It doesn't hurt that the Shandle comes in a variety of kid-friendly designs such as dinosaurs, martians and robots, which makes them attractive to toddlers.  (It also comes in elegant fashion prints and plain white, for those who prefer their bathrooms to have a more adult look).  Our daughter isn't yet fully potty-trained, but now she's comfortable enough to pee in the toilet while using her BabyBjorn potty seat, and she looks forward to using the "big potty."  (So much so that she's pretty much lost interest in her stand-alone "baby" potty!)If you've been holding off on getting this BabyBjorn potty seat because it doesn't have handles, please Google "Shandle" and consider giving the product a try.  It was the perfect solution for us.Grade: A- (1 star deducted because the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer doesn't have built-in handles).
+1	I started having my son sit on this and the potty chair when he turned 14 months and he actually prefers sitting on this than the potty chair that is low to the ground.  This is great for me because it is less clean up!Would highly recommend!
+1	This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying.
+1	After lots of reviews I figured this was the best seat for our long toilet's (Kohler brand). While this doesn't 100% fit/lock in. It does stay in place and is very comfortable for my son. It made for an easy transition from potty chair to the bigger toilet.
+1	We have two of these toilet trainers: one for upstairs and one for downstairs. Love it! Easy for my two year old boy to use, non-slip, and does not attach to the toilet, so you simply lift it off to use the regular seat. The raised part in front is great--we don't have any aiming problems with this potty:)
+1	This is the first seat you used for potty training.  I LOVED it for the following reasons: 1. it adjusts to stay in place, 2. it fit all of the toilets in the house (important when you have two round and one elongated toilet), 3. it wasn't padded or cheesy (cheesy characters), and 4. I like that the shape sort of holds the child in.  I potty trained my daughter the week she turned 2 and wanted to be sure that she didn't fall off of the potty, but I also didn't want to deal with emptying a little potty into a big one.  This is a GREAT seat.  I would give it 4 1/2 starts if I could.  We ended up needing a second seat for another toilet and it had handles.  My daughter prefers to have the handles (even if the seat itself is not as secure), especially when she is pooping.
+1	The hubs and I don't really buy a lot of special baby/kid goods. Our two year old son drinks out of normal glasses, he eats with adult silverware, he never used a pacifier, etc etc. So we didn't want to buy him a separate little potty chair, either. Might as well start him on the real thing so we don't have to switch him over later, right? We bought this so that he could sit comfortably on a normal toilet.This is a lovely, sturdy device, which is very easy to clean and has a convenient hook for hanging on the wall. What a nice bathroom decoration. The guests. just. love. it. &#34;You have a toilet seat on your wall! Wow! That's great!&#34; said nobody ever. But whatever, it's an easy way to store it. The front lip is a little difficult for my son to get over when he's sitting down, but it seems like somewhat of a safety feature, so I'm good with it.I don't really know what to say. It's well made, but come on, it's a potty seat. Your kid sits on it to pee. It's not super hard to get that wrong. Anyway, my son is still not really interested in the potty, but that speaks more to his love of pooping in his diaper in whatever hidden corner he can find than the quality of the chair. I'd recommend this product to others.
+1	Having our grandson move closer meant I needed to purchase some necessary equipment - and a potty seat is definitely necessary.  However, the toilets in our home have elongated seats and many of the potty seats I looked at were made for standard toilet seats.  After reading numerous Amazon reviews, I decided to purchase the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer and am very pleased with my choice.The BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer sits on the seat and is then secured by turning a wheel at the back of the seat.  This moves two "wings" so that the seat attaches securely to the toilet seat, even if it is an elongated seat.  After securing the seat, I tried to wiggle the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer from side-to-side as might happen with a rambunctious toddler.  The seat held firmly in place.The splash guard at the front of the seat is sufficiently high to prevent accidental oversprays.  Further, it is curved so that liquids do not hit it and splash out the sides; they flow down into the toilet as they should.  The solid piece construction of the main seat prevents waste products from becoming trapped in grooves or joints and minimizes the possibility of odor.Further, the seat rinses off easily and can then be hung, by the large attached loop, to dripdry.  I hung a light S-shaped hook over the towelbar on the back wall of the bathtub and use it to hold the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer after it has been rinsed.If you are looking for a quality potty seat which will fit both standard and elongated toilet seats, you should definitely consider the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer.  It is a five-star necessity!
+1	Love this thing.  Relatively cheap, comes in various colors, has an adjustment knob to 'fit' various toilet sizes, the hooks allows you to hang it (added a tacky hook to bathroom wall) and best of all it doesn't have the creavises other seats have - let me explain.  Had another potty seat that was 'cushioned' -&#62;  not sure why a kid needs a cushioned seat, it is not like they will be sitting reading the newspaper for ten minutes at a time - anyway, it didn't take long for the vinyl cushion to get pee and other 'gunk' stuck between the cushion and the plastic rim - and then you have to look at it each time to put it on the toilet.  This is a better option.
+1	We've been potty training my son for several weeks now, and he showed signs of being interested in using the big potty.  So we bought a well-rated fancy potty seat with all sorts of "features" that was absolutely terrible.  It was quickly returned, and replaced with this one.This seat is SO easy to use - there's a dial that's accessible from the top back to adjust its fit, and it's snug as could be.  We have one of the long oval toilet bowls, and that didn't cause any trouble with this seat.  It's secure and doesn't move around, but really easy to take off again for adults and older kids to use.  This only showed up this morning, but already my two and a half year old has nearly figured out how to get it on and off the toilet seat by himself.  It has a nice pee-guard for little boys, and sits down into the toilet a bit so the pee doesn't end up coming out between the toilet and seat.  We put a big sturdy step stool in front of the toilet, and my son is so excited now that he can get up there and down again by himself!
+1	We love this seat so much, we ended up getting two...one for each of our bathrooms. Our 2.5yr old has no problem getting on this herself with the help of a step stool and she likes the fact that she's going potty like a grown-up. Our favorite thing about using this seat is no more cleaning out pee-pee and poo-poo (gets pretty gross when my girl has diarrhea) since it goes right in the toilet!
+1	We ordered this seat for our daughter after she liked the one her cousins had.  It is a great size for a little two-year-old learning to sit on the toilet.  The front part can get a little messy if they scoot forward after using the bathroom, but the surface is very easy to clean.  This is a great little seat.
+1	Now I know why the cheap potty seats are so cheap. Wish I has been able to see this side-by-side with the cheap ones. If I had this would have been the one I would have bought. This potty seat is well designed, doesn't rock, and is one piece. It's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son's house and the one at my house. My granddaughter wouldn't sit one the "cheap" one bought originally but really likes this one. Dry days are coming soon, wish they had these when my kids were at this stage.
+1	This product really does fit ALL toilets. We used it on the road at a hotel, and it fit on the hotel's elongated toilet. I highly recommend it.
+1	Fits on larger toilet seat. I don't even need to secure it to the lid, fits perfectly without moving. Easy to clean and lightweight. Transportable if you need to take it places.
+1	So easy to put on, use and take off that my two-year-old has no problem doing it by himself.  I have an oval, enlongated toilet that we use this seat on. A twist of the dial in back simply adjusts it to fit. There's no screwing and unscrewing it each time you use it... just do it once for fit.There's a different brand at church that has handles, so I thought he'd miss not having the them to hold onto. He doesn't miss them at all. In fact, if you are potty training, it's best to imitate the really thing anyways.  You're not going to find handles on a public toilet, so why train your kids to get used to them being there?The rubber edge allows it to grip the seat. You put it on there and it's not going to slip.The gentle contour of the front splash guard makes it a great seat for both boys and girls to use. It doesn't get in the way and is still functional.It does what it says and does it well. Very happy with this purchase.
+1	Fits our toilet seat very without sliding and no space left on sides. Does not wiggle when set correctly. Suitable for boy or girl. Classy, not gaudy, if you can say that of a toilet seat.
+1	I bought one of these potties for my 18 month old and it is fantastic!  I just bought another one to use in the other bathroom.  It doesn't move around like the other potty seats she has used.  Would definitely recommend!
-1	Bought two based on a lot of the good reviews, one for our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms. The splash guard can hurt your son. Also the splash guard doesn't work to keep the pee from shooting out from under the seat. If you have a girl it might be for you, if you have a boy don't get this seat. Make sure you read the other reviews about boys and this potty seat. Also the seat is bulky and very annoying to get it to fit each time. This potty seat has discourage our son from wanting to use the potty. If anyone who has had a hard time potty training their kids this will make it so much harder!!
+1	We have bought three of these toilet trainers (one for each bathroom).  My daughter loves them and it gives her the perfect amount of comfort and support during potty training.  Cannot recommend these enough!!!!!
+1	We bought one for each bathroom (one upstairs, one on main floor) and it was easier and better to travel with than the little green baby bjorn potty.  The price is awesome.  My girl covered it in lifelike bug stickers which is just funny when company comes.  For as long as their little tushes are too small for the big seat, it is awesome.
+1	My son used this when we transition from the potty chair to the toilet. This helped him tremendously and made the toilet more comfortable. He didn't have to fear falling in the toilet with this. I hung mine on the bathroom wall and he would take it down and put it on the toilet himself when he had to do #2 and then put it back when he was done.
+1	My little one has tried a few different toilet trainers, and this one by far is the best.  It's ergonomically designed to allow for a comfortable set as well as preventing over shooting with the front elevated part.
+1	You can ask my husband - I've purchased at LEAST 5 potty seats since getting our son to use the potty.  I've returned 4 of them immediately after seeing how the design of the seat would not work for our son (I would have a little Bellagio Fountain spraying on my floor instead of the toilet).  The one seat that did end up staying in our house seemed great at first, but I later discovered that there were gaps on the bottle of the seat that captured urine and required constant cleaning.  So I sucked it up and threw down the money for the more expensive Baby Bjorn.  WHY didn't I buy this sooner!?!?This is the best potty seat I purchased.  There are absolutely no hidden gaps or fabrics that can soak up or trap urine.  It is adjustable to fit into any type of toilet seat.  There is a small splash guard (more like a ridge) in the seat so no "fountaining" can occur.  Everything that I've complained about in the previous potty seats is addressed with the Baby Bjorn - it works fantastically!  Highly HIGHLY recommended.
+1	In a move of overzealous anticipation which has become common for me, I bought both this toilet trainer seat and the Bjorn stand alone potty for my daughter when she was 18 months old. Obviously she didn't do much with either, but she liked to sit on the stand alone potty and pretend she was going, or put her stuffed animals on it to make them pee. Fast forward to about a week ago, she just turned 2 in August, and she uses this toilet trainer all the time. For some reason she will not use the stand alone at all. As others have mentioned, she can place it on the toilet herself, which she really enjoys, and even helps me wipe it off after using. Even with a girl, she has managed to pee over the splash guard twice so far, but it is really a small price to pay for how clean and convenient this seat is. Partially it is because she is so fascinated with seeing what is going on that she leans back and the pee goes out, so it is not actually a flaw in design. I love that it fits in my (formerly) diaper bag, so she always has a clean toilet seat, even while travelling. I was skeptical of this seat initially, but bought it anyway based on the reviews, and boy am I glad I had this on hand and ready to go, because when the timing is right, it's right!
+1	When we were potty training our daughter, my friend told me that the toilet trainer that goes on toilet might be better to use over the one that sits on the ground because if they get too used to the one on the ground, they may be scared to go on the toilet since it's higher up.  So we bought this one and even if they are still too small, you don't have to worry about them falling into the toilet because of the way it's made.  My son is 11 months and he can sit on the toilet on this and we don't worry about him falling in.  He may try to get off but we just sit there too and bring toys or things for him to do while he sits there and then he doesn't try to climb off.
+1	Using the wheel to adjust this for a snug fit on our toilet seats was VERY easy, very pleased with this seat, it seems very comfortable for our 21 month old. Also recommend buying potty hooks for a few buck each (may be cheapest at BRU unless things change). I have a potty chair for my son but want him to have the option of using the big potty on a regular basis as soon as possible, so I am fitting each toilet in our house with one of these.
+1	The lip on this is necessary for boys! Looks nice, cleans well, travels well, stays put. It's perfect for my 3 year old.
+1	I bought this seat based on all the great reviews and I was not disappointed. My son just turned 2 and is small for his age and he fits perfectly on this seat. What I also love about the seat is that it doesn't move once you get it on the toilet. I don't have to worry about my son slipping and sliding around as he moves on the potty. I bought 2!
+1	This is not offensive to look at, it stays put on the toilet and the splashguard works beautifully. Its very easy to clean because it's all one piece and my son feels very comfortable sitting on this one without pinching his thighs or feeling like he may tip to the side.
-1	Love the company but this trainer does not fit a round toilet and seat. (We have a Toto with a Bemis seat.) This is not entirely clear in the product description, so I hope this review helps others avoid the hassle of ordering and returning.
+1	This was easy enough for my toddler to put on the toilet. It's simple to clean and fits well. We very much preferred this over the potty seat that doesn't sit on the toilet - my son wanted the &#34;real thing&#34;. We really love this toilet trainer.
+1	our potty training days are over for the time being, but this was great! i could tell my daughter was comfortable sitting on it, and it didn't scoot around at all. it's easy to remove quickly for others who are already potty trained when they gotta go!
+1	My son was scared of falling into the toilet so this was super helpful when we really dove into potty training. He liked that it tightened down so it didn't slide around like a cheaper model we had picked up. The little lip in the front is very handy for boys learning to aim while seated if you know what I mean. ;) We're getting ready to use it for boy #2 and it still looks new.
+1	We have now bought 3, count them 3, different potty scenarios for our 2-year-old, and this is by far the best.  Stays on snugly, prevents leaks well, easy to clean.
+1	This toilet seat works great.  Nice design, fits easily on toilet.  When our son was 3 he was able to attach and remove it on his own with no issues.  Easy to clean.  I recommend this item (and the matching step stool too!).
+1	My son it doing well with this seat, no little potty, staight to this seat.  The lip could be a little higher as sometimes he sprays over.  Fits on the toliet really snug
+1	I am embarrassed to admit how happy I am about this potty seat. We were using (without any luck) the Prince Lionheart weePod. The BB toilet trainer by comparison #1 has the dial adjustment to fit any toilet, long or round. I put a small black dot on the dial where it has the perfect fit, because with time, it does adjust ever so slightly, so I know exactly where it needs to be snug. #2 The entire base that sits on your toilet seat is lined with rubber so there's a no slip grip. No need to try & get suction cups to try & keep the seat stable. #3 the splash guard is not so huge & in the way. My daughter was having such a hard time getting herself up, on & over the hump on the weePod. This may be a downside for boys, but is a bonus for girls. #4 You can hang it. I put a command hook a few inches below the tp roll & that's where we hang it between uses. My daughter is able to get it herself and place it on herself. All key things in her independence. And there's no putting it on wrong because the positioning is always right. #5 This is completely personal reasoning, but for some reason the fact that it is hard plastic rather than squishy soft material (in my head) makes it seem more sanitary. Or maybe because its clean & white, idk. That being said, when I say hard plastic, it is not by all means uncomfortable. The way it is shape gives the right alignment to be sitting on it. The weePod, for whatever reason, would cause her to lean back in the seat. My daughter loves this seat.  A+++ in everyway. Worth every penny!
+1	My son is 3 years old and I potty trained him in 1 day. I purchased this toilet seat along with a potty book for boys (and no potty). He learned to go on this by itself, I was amazed at how fast he learned. All I had to do was get rid of the diapers and buy him big boy underwear to start the potty journey. It took a day of "accidents", but it was well worth it. This toilet seat is versatile and you can take it along anywhere you go! I highly recommend it -- no need for a potty either :).
+1	We just potty trained our daughter 2 weeks ago, and having her sit on the big potty has been a challenge. We'd much rather her to her business on a real potty than the plastic Baby Bjorn potties that we also have.This device is simply fantastic. What you would expect from Baby Bjorn. Well priced, well made, and very functional.
+1	I bought this item after reading the reviews for it here on Amazon.  I have a less exspensive cushioned princess toilet topper but this Baby Bjorn is SO MUCH better!PROS--Easily adjustable to fit most (if not all) toliet seats.-Snug fit; doesn't wiggle/wobble when climbed onto by my 28lb 2yr old & no worries of her legs/fingers being pinched between the seats.-Ergonomic design; my daughter seems very comfortable on this seat; Much more so than the "cushioned" one I mentioned prior.-Would work well for girls or boys since it has a high front side which helps to avoid accidents.-Very estically pleasing.-One fluid piece so it is easy to clean; no grooves, creases, etc. to have to worry about.-Durable; something I can definitley hold onto for our next baby.CONS-N/A ;)I would highly recommend this item.  It's worth the extra $10 you'll pay for it over the cheaper ones!
+1	This seat is very easy to install and fits securely.  My daughter was hesitant at first but there wasn't even a scare of her falling in once she sat on it!
+1	I like the style and ease of this potty seat, but for my daughter, the hole is much too big.  She squirms on it, and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in.  I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat.  Hopefully she will grow into this one.  She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side.
+1	It's hard to get excited about a potty seat, but my toddler loves this one. We keep the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer on a low hook next to the toilet for him to grab. He can carry it by the little rubber handle and (with some help) put it on the seat. I've already adjusted the potty seat to fit our elongated toilet. It fits nice and snug on top of the toilet seat with no rocking or tipping, and my son sits on it quite well with no danger of falling in or off it (he's almost 2 but he's big for his age). It fits round toilet seats too with just a turn of the dial, which makes it great for travel. I wish it came with a travel bag/carrier of some sort. (I'll have to make my own travel potty kit: an old duffel bag, flat-folding step stool, flushable wipes, disinfectant wipes, antibacterial hand gel, etc.) It's made of the same durable material as the seat that came with our white toilet so it matches perfectly, and it's easy to clean. I expect the guard in the front will keep things where they're supposed to go -- we haven't had a "full" event yet, but fingers crossed.
+1	These are just great. My son sits comfortably on them. No hassles as they are adjustable. Baby Bjorn delivers great quality as always. I have 2 of these & would recommend these to everyone always.
-1	Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me.  My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it.  The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his "equipment" being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too).
+1	Works Great!  Easily get a tight fit to the toilet seat and remove for adults in just seconds.  I would buy this product again and would recommend it to anyone.
+1	Not much to say beyond that - it does what its supposed to do, and its easy to clean. I started using this on my son when he was 9 months old - have nothing to complain about.
-1	I'm surprised by how well this is rated so I decided to add my two cents to the minority.The PROS:  Fits snugly on any seat. We have round and elongated and it fits both no problem. Also, easy to clean.  I also like the look of it; simple and clean. I put one in the guest bathroom and I can leave it there when I have people over.The CONS: By the time you get the seat cover up, the pants down, the seat on and plop you kid on the toilet he's already pee'd hisself.The slashguard - after watching my sons try to get up from it on there own I quickly realized they might end up eunuchs. Even with the stool and me standing there it is still dangerous; they have to be lifted.  When they try to maneuver around it, the seat becomes dislodged from putting there weight on one side. I was horrified to hear that some boys actually pulled their skin open and needed stitches. I was even more appalled by some reviewers saying that the parents should have been more vigilant. With all the worry and guilt inherant in parenting thats just a mean thing to say; and not trure.  The whole point of potty training is to get your child to go on their own. They can't learn if you are hovering every time.I bought the built in toilet seat instead. There are two seats in one so both children and adults can use it.
+1	my son loves it!i bought 4 different brands for him to try out and this is the best one!perfect shape, perfect comfort, perfect size for a 4 yr old. (potty trained now)sometimes, he sits on this for a long time....so i know it's very comfortable....LOLthe handle helps germophobic mommies. and it easy to wash too.the pee cover should be higher though as he has to hold down his thing so as not to pee all over the toilet floor.even with that, it is still a 5 star rating!
+1	having gone through several (cheaper) seats - and tons of clorox wipes cleaning up the dribbles off the toilet and floor - I read reviews and tried this one for my twins.  the adjustable mechanism makes all the difference in the world - as long as its adjusted snugly on the toilet, no leaks, dribbles, messes!  i bought one for each toilet that they use and it's worth the $, no question!
+1	I keep this toilet seat in my son's bathroom along with the Bjorn step stool. My son loves using the potty with this seat! The simple design makes it easy to clean and use. I also took a plastic over the door towel hook and hung it from under the tank of our toilet (on the side). This works perfectly to hang the seat by its plastic handle when not in use.
+1	I've bought several potty training seats, and this is by far the very best out there as far as fit and stability.If I were going to change one thing about it, it would be to make a boy's version and a girl's; the guard in front is pretty unnecessary for our daughter, and it gets in the way of her wiping herself.With that said, I'm really happy with the way it adjusts to fit the seat and doesn't wobble or slide to one side, like other seats I've tried. It's also very easy to take on and off the toilet seat so others can use the bathroom with no trouble, thanks to the handle.Don't bother with those other seats. This is the one you need.
+1	I bought this for my 8 months old daughter after she had been using the BabyBjorn potty for a month or so. I realised that it wasn't much fun cleaning the potty so decided to give this toilet seat a go and it's been working great for us. My daughter is happy seating on it, it's small enough for her and it's very easy to install, put on and take off.
+1	Purchased this after purchasing the Babybjorn Smart Potty because the other was too high at first. This one is just ever so slightly smaller and a much better fit for either small or early trained kids.
+1	My son is little so it may not be good for larger kids starting to potty train. He's about 27 pounds age 21 months.Get some of those disinfectant wipes and clean it out each time and you're good. (Wear gloves and wash your hands after too.)Fits in a small space in my small bathroom without an issue.
+1	This potty is great. As the previous reviewer mentioned, it's one piece so nowhere for the pee to go except inside. I think the only fault is that it's incredibly low to the ground, so although that is great for new learners, once they master the potty training and you just need an extra around the house, it doesn't encourage them to go because it's too short. If you can spend a bit more, the newer model with the inside that comes out ($24.95) is much better in my opinion. HIgher for sure, and actually easier to dump since it has an insert. Make sure never to use bleach in these, though, I ruined the bottom of one of these by letting it sit in a 50% bleach solution, it ate away the smooth bottom.
+1	I have been practicing EC with me 2 month old, and she went on this the first time I tried! Its easy to dump it into the toilet and rinse in the bathroom sink (the one we don't use, hah). Great little potty for introducing the concept of going potty outside a diaper early on. It's small because it's meant for early use.
+1	I like the simplicity of the chair, its easy to grab and use when an any room and clean is really easy. The only complaint I have is the comfort factor, but I don't see how that could be improved without loosing the ability to grab and go and clean easy. I use it with my 9 month old twin girls when I catch them. We aren't full blown potty training yet, so I imagine when we do we will probably need a more perm. fixture.
+1	Great size for a baby but the bottom can slip on a smooth floor. Scared my baby a bit when it slipped unexpectedly. The guard in front is large enough to contain pee but not too large for an infant. We mostly used this as a travel or back-up potty, with parental support.
+1	Ok so my 8mo old has been doing EC (google it) since 3 mo old.So we have like 4 of these (1 per room)You gotta get a WHItE one!! White makes it so much easier to see if he has gone #1 (and 2).I wish all 4 of ours were white.Please star this so others know white is the way to go.Oh and bjorn, please make a clear one!!Frank
+1	I've noticed that the negative reviews on this potty focus on how small it is. Yes, it IS small. It would be too small for most kids beyond the age of 3 and any bigger/tall  toddlers. If you are in that category you'd want to look at one of the larger Bjorn potties.HOWEVER, if you are ECing a baby or working on potty training with a younger/smaller toddler, this potty is great. Their feet will touch the ground and it's easy for them to sit on. For myself I love the simple, one-piece design. This makes it really easy to carry to different areas of the house, in the car, and it seems less tempting to be used as a hat. We have used 3 different potties over the years with our children and this is my favorite. The back has a knotch cut out for easy carrying. Really great little potty.
+1	We started with this potty when my son was around 6 months. He's 3 now and still uses it, although he's opting for the potty seat more often. Good learning potty as it's easy to sit on quickly. No messy parts to clean. Easy to take on the go.
+1	To date, we have purchased 4 of these potties for our petite 14 month old daughter (upstairs, downstairs, both parents' cars), when we wanted to start to introduce toileting in a natural way. (Petite = 20 lbs, 28 1/2 inches tall, wearing 12 mos clothes). It is a tiny potty, and we were looking for one because nothing in the aisle at Target was small enough for her to sit comfortably on it. From the minute I unpacked her potty, she walked right over and sat down on it, diaper and all. We have now successfully integrated it into our diaper-changing routine, and she fits nicely. I like that it's backless in that it's easier to sit behind her and make potty time a relaxing time, while I hold a book in front of her. I do wish it had a higher back, a la the bigger Baby Bjorn potty, so that she had something to rest her back on for long sits. I like that it is all one piece, making it super easy to clean. It does fit well in our little bathrooms, too. I would suggest this potty for parents who are introducing potty training early, including but not limited to EC'ers.
+1	We love it, baby loves it, washes easy, good price, free shipping when bought from Amazon! Great size for EC babies!
+1	This potty is the perfect size for anyone doing Elimination Communication with her baby.My baby is still too young to actually sit on it, but it works great for something to hold him over. The lip is especially great for little boys. :)Plus, it's light and easily transportable.I love it that Baby Bjorn has recognized the need for a smaller potty for the ECing crowd or those with smaller children wanting to use the potty.
+1	Love this potty.  I highly recommend this potty.  It works well and I can't imagine anything better.  I can definitely recommend it.
+1	This little thing could not have been more perfect for what I wanted and my daughter needed. I bought it when she was about 8 months old and just had her sit on it before bathtime while I got the water running to get used to having it in her environment. She went #1 and #2 on her first sit. Since then, she is now 13 months old and nearly every time we sit her on it, she goes #1. We're still only using it to allow her to adapt to its presence since they don't have potties for her to use at daycare, but I absolutely love this potty and so does she!The only one thing that has given us a hard time is that she has figured out how to "scoot" around on it which was making it more of a vehicle than a potty. I read another reviewer that just put some no-slip type of gripper on the bottom so I gave it a shot. It solved the problem and we are back to happily going in her potty.I highly recommend it! It looks incredibly comfortable and my little lady is very tall for her age. She has no problem sitting on it or using it to do her business. We all love it! Also, I was able to pack it in my suitcase when we went to grandma's so that's a huge plus!
+1	This is a no frills, easy to clean, comfortable potty...just as a potty is supposed to be. I wanted something that would be comfortable for her little bumbum but nothing that would distract her from the job at hand. The price was definitely a plus as well. She is 2 1/2 years old, at 29 lbs and 34 inches and is on her way to becoming fully potty trained. Cleaning is pretty easy, I wipe with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes 4-Pack: 1 Fresh Scent, 2 Lemon Fresh, 1 Orange (78 Wipes Per Canister - 312 Wet Wipes Total), wash with hot water and spray withClorox Anywhere Daily Sanitizing Spray, 22-Fluid Ounce Bottles (Case of 9)and let dry or wipe dry.
+1	Very simple, very economical and it fits small babies. We started poty traning our son at 5 months and he loves to be on the poty. The splashguard protects well. It is easy to clean - overall full satisfaction!
+1	We got this one and the Summer Infant and they're so similar you might as well get the cheaper one. This one is definitely taller but our son hasn't had better or worse luck with either one.
+1	This is a great potty seat and very easy to manage, however the potty disassembles quite easily from the base and does not have a cover.  I was not able to find a babybjorn with the aforementioned essentials. Would buy the same brand, if they made a new version that covers and did not come apart so easily from the base (my daughter take out the center all the time)which can become a problem if she empties the content.
+1	This is a great product. It's easy for the babes to sit on comfortably. It's easy to clean b/c it only has one part. And it has that nice rubber ring on the bottom to prevent slides.
+1	This potty is simple, tough, and great for a boy. Helps keep the pee in, and won't kill his "bits" if he gets caught on it while sitting. It is easy for a child to take the bowl out, empty it into the toilet and put the bowl back into the frame.
+1	I really wanted my boy to train with just the toilet insert, but it was not working. I'm grateful I finally caved and bought this. This smaller kid friendly toilet makes potty training a more manageable task for kids. My son even started pouring his own waste into the regular toilet. He only used this for about three to four weeks. Once he mastered his little potty he was able to go straight to the big one (no inserts).
-1	I ordered this potty because after weeks of research, this was the only potty I could find that's BPA free. When it came my daughter was excited to try it. Unfotunately she pinched her finger on the pull out center. She also voiced that her bottom hurt because it was too hard. She's only 25 lbs and is a small girl but there isn't enough seat so it's uncomfortable. She now refuses to sit on it. It's going back.
+1	I first got this for my 6month old son, after reading the "Diaper free before 3" book. In India, the grandmothers start potty training the babies well around 4-5 months when they start sitting with support. In the same aspect, I got this chair just to make sure my son sits on the potty chair when parents use the bathroom and it worked very well. I am writing this review since I dint see any other reviews for kids as young as 6 months.The first day, as soon as me and my son got up, we went to the bathroom and sat on our own potty chairs, surprisingly, he peed in this, on the first day only! From then on we are repeating it every day and he seems to understand he has to pee to get out of that chair and hence does it. He likes to sit on this one, as it has the backrest, and armrest for both of his arms and his foot has not yet touched the floor but, its good enough for him. In a way, its good that his foot has not touched the floor yet, as he doesnt try to stand up :-). He has one of his squirty friends or a book in his hands to keep him happy. Even if he tries to reach for something on the either side, the chair doesnt trip and it holds well.Every single time, I put him on this, any time of day, he pees assuming thats what I want him to do. Pooping, we have not started yet, but so far it has been easy to clean and the splash guard does work great, remove the inner seat and wash it in warm water, and its even sanitized!Its been about a month since I got the first potty and here I am ready to buy my second one for the bathroom on the first floor. I got the Fisher-Price Precious Planet Froggy Friend Potty but he doesnt like it since it has no back or arm rest! He wouldnt sit on it even once, and its going back to Amazon today while I order my second potty chair!
+1	This is the only potty chair we used with our little one.  We didn't use bells and whistles.  We didn't use stickers.  This was all she needed.  It was very ergonomical for her little frame.
+1	We bought this potty to train our daughter off diapers. At first she seemed like she was avoiding it. Then one day (just about 2 years old) she started asking to go to the potty by herself. It is easy to clean. It is stable. It is easy to move around the house and most importantly she likes it.
+1	The pink color is great! Motivated my very girlie 2 year old to want to start using the potty! Easy to clean, comfy to sit on.
+1	honestly, i was going to get the smart potty instead, but this was eligible for amazon prime and thus a few cents cheaper [every penny counts these days!] but, im glad i got the potty chair. on a quick note, the green is not a bright lime green, its more of a muted lime green if that makes sense. [more natural-leaf-looking than neon.]were not getting too serious about potty training, just yet, but we do set our daughter on the potty after naps. shes peed in it a couple times, now. the center "potty bowl" removes easily and doesnt force you to touch anywhere the pee has touched since it has a "lip" to grab up under the front "horn" of the bowl. you simply remove and dump the bowl part into the adult potty, maybe put a lil water in it from the faucet to rinse it and dump the contaminated water into the toilet, too. very, very easy to use. my daughter can sit on it herself [shes 13m] and stand up unassisted, as well. the back chair part aids her in sitting down so she doesnt plop down [like every child this age does] and lean back too far.the only down side i see with this potty is my daughters curious and wants to touch inside the bowl while sitting on the potty. but thats just a learning curve of whats "yucky" and shouldnt be touched. ;)overall, i recommend the baby bjorn potty chair because it doesnt have any bells and whistles [which i find pretty pointless for a get-down-to-business type of personal business,] its fairly inexpensive compaired to others out there, and its functional and safe [no leaning back too far.]
+1	With five young children in our home, we have two of these Baby Bjorn potties. With constant use (and abuse) they still look brand new! They are easy to clean (I have even stuck the bowl portion in the dishwasher) and easy to transport. My kids LOVE the bright colors which make potty training easier :) Well worth the money!!
+1	We've tried a number of potties for kids, and this is by far the best brand and design. There's also a version without a &#34;chair&#34; back that is equally good; we have them both.PROS:-- ergonomic, comfortable for toddlers and even infants if you are doing elimination communication-- all molded plastic design makes it easy to keep clean, no cushion to get soggy-- insert lifts out for easy dumping into adult toilet, fits in sink for washing clean-- sturdy base ensures your kid will not tip it over, even if wiggly-- spray guard works well for boys but still is small enough to let kids get on easilyCONS-- your toddler may not want to transition to big toilet because these are so comfortableI really can't think of any cons for these potties.  We have one in each bathroom, and when my son was learning, we kept one in his bedroom as well.  We have a smaller version of this one that stays in the back of our car for those unforeseen &#34;I have to go potty NOW&#34; incidents.  They are so sturdy, are easy to clean and maintain, and my toddler can even empty this one easily himself without making a mess.  Some potties have cushions and other moving parts, making it really complicated to disassemble for emptying.  This one is a breeze.Also, the bowl is oval shaped and plenty long enough to accommodate larger toddlers without having positioning issues.  I've seen some that have a tiny circular opening, which is really awkward, especially for boys, to make sure nothing misses...GREAT FOR EC - If you do elimination communication or infant pottying, these are great.  The insert can be removed and held in your lap -- used as a top hat potty -- until your child is old enough to sit freely on the potty.I absolutely LOVE these potties because they are so practical, simple to use, and child friendly.  My toddler prefers this style to all the other ones he's tried.  No gimmicks, just a potty.  What you need.
+1	Our boy started potty training around 15 months, and this high back was great for him at that young age, plus it is very easy to clean and fits his small tush (he is only 25 lbs). We got one for each of the grandparents house because he loved it so much and wanted to use it there.
+1	we havent learned yet to use on it but i love the color and looks nice in the rest room and
-1	This is a basic potty with the pot that can be removed for easy cleaning so it's easy to wash and clean but my poor kid stands up from sitting on this for mere minutes and has deep red marks on her legs and bottom, it's uncomfortable!  I'm going to order one with a cushy seat!
+1	My LO doesn't mind sitting on this at 7 months (we're starting EC) with a toy or a book and we're good to go. Has great support. She was a little hesitant on day 1 but now does not mind at all although I still hold on to her. Easy clean up and very durable. I'm tempted to get one for downstairs for convenience sake.
+1	This is a great potty.  The biggest issue to me was cleaning.  This chair has no seems or corners to trap things.  The inner liner lifts off and is easy to wipe clean with a disinfectant cloth.  The boy shield is not too high and is rounded nicely so they won't hurt themselves while getting on.  The base is very solid and sturdy and doesn't move at all.  It also looks comfortable with the arm rests.  My son isn't potty trained yet but we purchased it so he could get used to sitting in it.  He seems very happy and will even sit in it to read a book.  Does what it should and doesn't distract from what they are supposed to be doing with alot of toys and noise.
+1	The high back and sturdy base make this chair perfect for little ones just getting the hang of using the potty. Be aware that with a boy the splash guard might not catch all the pee, but you can help him learn how to sit correctly and then it doesn't happen!
+1	My two-year-old daughter loves this potty chair and prefers it over her Prince Lionheart potty chair. The chair itself is very sturdy and extremely easy to clean. I love that it is ergonomic and that there is a "high back." There aren't many potty chairs out there that are comparable to this one -- trust me, I've looked!
+1	I have a 2 year old in the potty training phase. I first potty we bought him was terrible, so I decided to try the Babybjorn. We ALL are so happy we did! It's a perfect potty chair. There are only 2 pieces and NO nooks to squeeze into to clean. it's very simple in design. It has a wonderful pee guard for my boy and he never gets the pee on the floor. He actually sits back a bit and watchs himself pee. I just love this potty for the ease of cleaning it. I just lift out the bowl, dump and rinse. It's good to go.At the end of the day, I just spray a little Clorox anywhere on it and let it dry for the next day. My son loves it, too. Its very comfortable and easy for him to use on his own. When we were doing the naked potty training (now we hav emoved to underwear! yah!) he was able to get to the potty and go all by himself without trying to get a lid off like the previous potty we bought. He would sometimes just sit there for a decent period of time just waiting. He was totally comfortable. LOVE this potty and we will be using it again with our second boy due in a few months.
+1	Let's see...what to write about the potty. It is easy to clean, my daughter uses it, and it has held up well so far. I like it because it doesn't have a whole lot of bells and whistles and it does what it is suppose to- my daughter didn't seem interested in the toilets that sang to her or did special tricks.  Overall a good product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a training seat.
+1	This is a great potty chair.  We have a frog potty in our upstairs bathroom and my daughter complains that it hurts her bum.  This is her favorite and she says it is comfy.  It's the perfect size and easy to dump and clean after each use.
+1	This has a very nice design and is not annoying looking like most potties. The high back is nice for my daughter because she can read her favorite book and lean back. Rubber grip on the bottom works well too, does not slide around.
+1	I had a Safety 1st potty that I just hated before I bought this Baby Bjorn potty.  It leaked, its round opening was WAY too small, and I had a ton of problems with my son leaking all over the front and on to the floor.  Plus it came apart in many pieces and had lots of spots bacteria could hide.  The Baby Bjorn takes care of all the problems I had with the Safety 1st potty!The simple construction is so sanitary and easy to clean.  There are no little places for bacteria to collect.The opening is bigger than other potty chairs and oblong instead of round, so no more pooping on the seat.  This alone would have sold me on this potty.The splash guard is great for boys.  No more peeing off the front of the potty and no flimsy detachable splash guards that flip down into the seat.It has a nice rubber grip on the bottom to keep it in the same place on the floor.Another plus is that it's nice looking and blends in with the rest of the bathroom.I'm very happy with the quality and design of this potty and I have NO complaints!
+1	I like how it is a basic potty with no frills.  Currently DS is not using it yet, but I can't wait to get out of cloth diapers!
+1	I started potty training my son at about 14 months, and he is short for his age.  This potty was a pretty good height for him, so it was comfortable and not too high, and it still fits him at 18 months.  The guard in front forces his legs apart a bit and is high enough to catch most of a boy's unpredictable flow.  Also wipes clean easily and doesn't retain any stains or odors.
+1	We were using a Bjorn Little Potty (which they don't make anymore) for a long time. But as my son grew, he kept overshooting and it was becoming a problem. At Grandma and Grandpa's house they had the Bjorn Smart Potty, which seemed to work better for him. I figured the Bjorn potties have been working well for us, lets try the top of the line Potty Chair!And its working great, the bowl rinses easily. Sometimes a little pee dribbles over the side, but its easy to rinse the whole chair in the tub. I keep it on a little rug to catch the dribbles and just throw that in the wash as needed. Any potty (with boys using it) is going to have occasional dribbles.And my son was pretty excited when it arrived!
+1	We are currently training our 2nd child.  With our first, we had 3 in diapers, giving us MAJOR motivation to get him potty trained, so we tried almost every seat out there.  Most of them were okay, but just got nasty quckly, were hard to disinfect, or were uncomfortable for my son.  The ones with the removable splash gaurd are not gentle and can scrape a child's sensitive parts.  Those were awful.  We were "potty training" for a full year before we finally saw the BabyBjorn potty chair in a local botique, and DS immediately sat in it.  He chose blue, and we took it home.  Within a week, he was trained, and began using the "big boy seat", so we saved the seat for our daughter.  It was incredable!  Now our 23 month old daughter is training.  We bought her this white babybjorn seat for our downstairs bathroom, with the blue upstairs.  She has been "training" for 6 days now, and is almost completely day trained!This seat is by far the best in our experiences.  Here's why:  1. the seat has a higher back and sides, which gives the child support while sitting down, standing up, or simply sitting there.  2. It is NOT easy to tip! several of the others we tried tipped without much effort when our child was putting pressure on the sides trying to sit down or stand.  3. It is super easy to clean - there aren't a bunch of seams to gather gunk, it's easy to wipe down with a clorox wipe and be done.  It's also super easy to take the little bucket out, and soak in clorox or hose down.  4. Kids can choose what color they want!  This was such a big deal to my children --- also, they are solid colors that can look nice with your bathroom.  The surface is also nice that your child can decorate the back with cute stickers if wanted.  5. It works for children of all different sizes!  My son was 40" and 42lbs when potty training, and my daughter is 25lbs and a little shrimp, and this seat fit them both WONDERFULLY.Overall, having tried MANY seats, this one was the absolute best for both our children, and I would highly reccomend it to anyone in need of a seat for potty training success~!
+1	I got this for my 11 month old because she was starting to tell us when she was wet and needed a change by pointing to her changing table or upstairs. Sometimes she would even tell us ahead of time. We are not planning to put any pressure to train at this age but we thought it would be good to have it on hand and get her familiar with it.To our surprise she figured out what it was for without a lot of fanfare and will go and stand on it or near it when she wants to use it. She doesn't use it every time, but has a handful of times and for sure is on the path to diaper freedom.Pros:Comfortable for the little one (she is about 20lbs)The inside comes out for cleaning and there are not any seams to gather gunk.Looks like a real toilet.Cons:Won't work as a seat on a real toilet.The back is smooth, slippery and tapered with no handle which makes it hard to grasp.Pro tip: If you are going to wear the inner liner like a top hat to make your child laugh, be aware she may try it on herself at some point. D'oh.
+1	This is really useful and simple to use. Just the right size / hight for little ones to do their business on their own. Really easy to clean. Would recommend it over the ones that go over the regular size toilet seats.. because those are too high.. and the kids would need a steps..
+1	I can't say enough good about this potty chair.  It's inexpensive (but very well made), SUPER easy to clean, has a very comfortable splash guard for boys and is comfortable (I'm assuming).  I originally bought the Safety 1st Potty Chair/stool.  Don't like it at all.  Tough to clean (lots of spaces for urine to get) and I don't think it's very comfortable as my son refused to sit on it.  Within 20 seconds of sitting on the Baby Bjorn he peed.  Refused for weeks to do that with the Safety 1st.  Great product.  Can't say enough good about it.From a parent's stand point, it's the best b/c it's soooo easy to clean.  I'm not clean freak, but this is a huge benefit with anything in the bathroom.Kudos to Baby Bjorn for a simple product.
+1	works great, son loves it. works perfect for boys.  great quality. the high back supports my son so he wont feel like he is falling back
+1	I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles.  There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed.  $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up.  In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase.  The simple design is easy to clean.  My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over.  The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits.  Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds.  My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes.  So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design.
+1	This is a pretty good design and we especially like the high back, which makes it possible for babies/toddlers to sit unsupported.
+1	We love this potty chair (bought one for each bathroom).  The design is simple.  It is comfortable and easy to use.  My 2 year old son has had no problems with it.  Very portable (we keep it in the back of our vehicle for longer trips).  We also have the BabyBjorn potty seat which is great as well.  I like having both so my son can choose whichever he wants (he likes both equally).  Made in the USA too!!
+1	I picked this potty up 2 days ago and I really can't complain.  My daughter is 9 months old and seems to have no problem with it.  I do understand some of the concerns with pee coming out because it happened to us yesterday.  I didn't make a big deal about it and it didn't seem to bother her.  I happened to have it sitting on a waterproof pad, just incase, so nothing got on my carpet.  But she seems very comfortable on it.
+1	This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to "keep it all in" if you know what I mean! =) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore! We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all. This one is truly THE BEST. Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up. It's also a really good size "bowl", some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in. AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!
+1	LOVE this potty - it's so easy and comfortable for our son to sit on. Picked this one up after starting out with a Fisher Price potty that didn't have a splash guard (stupid me!), which was frustrating for everyone involved (trying to tell/help a 2-year old to "point it down"... yeah, right) - as soon as our son tried this one out for the first time, his motivation level skyrocketed and he quickly became excited about peeing in the potty, instead of dreading it. The design and height are perfect, and the seat is easy to remove and empty (so much better than the ones where you have to slide the potty part out to empty it). Best potty ever!
+1	This potty is perfect!  So simple, no bells and whistles, no distractions, just a potty.  We've only had this chair a few days and our little boy is starting to get curious about what it is.  So far he's sat on it about ten times and gone in it 3!  We couldn't be happier.  Make sure you order &#34;Potty&#34; by Leslie Patricelli- it's the best potty book we've come across and our little one loves it.
+1	Your basic, sturdy little potty. Kids don't need all the flashy crap on the more expensive potties. The big toilet doesn't cheer or play princess music when you pee. Why set them up for disappointment? ;PMy son has no butt so he kind of doesn't fit on it and gets scared but maybe eventually his butt will get bigger or he'll get over it. Who knows haha.
-1	My son is 50th percentile for weight and height, so pretty average sized for a 2 year old.  As lots of reviewers have mentioned, the height of this potty is great, the handholds on the side are a help, the splash guard is built in so there are no pinching problems there, and the back WOULD be nice except...There is about an inch of space between the edge of the bowl and the back of the seat, so that when my son sits on it, the bowl shifts ever so slightly and his bum gets pinched in the back.  The reviews have been so positive on the no-pinching thing that I was stunned by this.  Even when he does not get pinched, he also ends up with seams cut into his little bum and back of legs, and as a result will not remain seated on this seat at all.  Therefore I cannot comment whether the pee goes into the bowl, because we never get that far.As far as disinfecting, I thought it would be really easy--just pull the bowl out, dump it out, wipe, disinfect with clorox on occasion...BUT several times poop has gotten under that back edge of the bowl, necessitating a cleaning of the rest of the seat as well, which is just a pain.Finally, the bowl is way too light and often sticks to my son's legs and he stands up.I cannot say, however, if there is anything better out there--we haven't found the "perfect" potty yet, but if this is the best of the portable potties, I guess we're going to have to go with the seat insert for our toilet, because this has turned out to be virtually worthless to us.
+1	This is the best potty chair in our (me and my toddler) opinion.  easy to clean and super comfortable for her.  plus, since lots of our friends use them, she has &#34;her&#34; potty when we go over.
+1	We have two of these - one for upstairs, and one for downstairs. It's great for our 2.5 year old boy who is learning to use the potty, and easy for us as parents to try to get him to use it.Pros:- There's a barrier/guard in the front so he doesn't pee everywhere. It's a huge improvement over other potties - sometimes boys just don't get that they need to hold it down.- The potty part removes easily for cleanup and pouring out.- It has a back so he doesn't fall off of it when trying to sit down. Sometimes sitting is a bit iffy at his age.- It's nonslip on the bottom, so it doesn't push around when he goes to sit.Cons:- A &#34;pour spout&#34; or something would be great along the back side.
+1	We started potty training my daughter at 2 and a half.  Right before her little brother was born.  We decided on the BABYBJORN potty chair because it seemed easy to clean, comfortable, and didn't have anything that would make her want to continue to use it as opposed the the real potty.We bought this when she was 2 just to get her used to it.  She sat on it while we were in the bathroom and read her books.  She was comfortable and nothing pinched her causing her to not want to use it. Eventually she got the idea and started using it herself.  At 2 and a half we ditched diapers and were exclusice to the potty training.She loved this chair because, gross, she loved to pick up the seat and dump the contents in the real potty.  Lucky for us there wasn't any huge mess.  We rinsed the chair out nightly with hot water and I cleaned her potty when we cleaned our bathroom, weekly.  She made sure I did as well.  She enjoyed using this potty, but when the time came to move exclusively to the big potty she wasn't sad to see this go.I'm very happy with this purchase and will purchase another one when we potty train my son.  Reason being I think I accidently tossed this in a made rage to declutter.Overall, cleans very easily, no weird places for poop or pee to hide, and she didn't become attached to it.
+1	When I began my research for a potty chair for my son, I had no idea how many things there were to consider! I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the  bowl afterward).
+1	Love this potty. No messy parts to clean. Rubber feet grab the floor to prevent slipping when the kid sits down. Large bowl with lip for boys is a  nice feature, no more "flippy" to fish out of the potty bowl. Can't say enough great things about this potty! Buy it already!
+1	We used this potty chair for both of our daughters, who potty trained at about 2.5 years old.  Its simple design is absolutely ideal for use and cleaning.  It's comfortable for toddlers to sit in, as well as easy for them to lift out the bowl and empty into the toilet themselves.  The splash guard molded as part of the bowl is excellent, providing protection as well as not being an impediment to the child sitting down.  (I can't speak for how much protection it offers for little boys, however.)  The smooth plastic without any real corners or edges makes cleaning effortless.  Plus, the rubber bottom really does keep the seat from slipping across the floor.  Plus, as an added bonus, it resembles the potty seat depicted in the "Once Upon A Potty" video, so the kids can easily connect the concept to real life.  I highly recommend it, and can't imagine using any other seat!
+1	We have this in both green and blue for our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms, respectively.  Son loves sitting on it and hasn't had any issues at all.  Very easy to clean and I like the high back because he can really sit there and relax a little while waiting to make a potty.
+1	I wanted a pot for boys and one that could be used for a healthy (chunky) child. My son used this pot for the entire potty training process. He had one at home and at both grandparents houses. The pee guard did its job and the size was great for my "chunky" little one.
+1	I have found that Baby Bjorn potty products are the best on the market and doesn't break the pocket book! It's oblong vs round so urine and poop stays in the pot. The built in splash guard is great! It's easy to clean and light weight, but built tough. Variety of colors. My triplets are all different shapes and sizes. We have a very large boy and has plenty of room for him. Our other son is a bit small for his age and because the pot is oval there is no leg stretching and no "falling in". Our daughter is long and very thin. She has no problems what so ever on this! Her tiny behind doesn't fall in or slip or anything. The splash guard never gets in her way! It's just the best! Other moms who see this ask where they can get one! Highly recommended!
+1	We love this potty.  We've had 4 other potties and this is my favorite.  It is super easy to clean up and the bright colors are great.  My son still loves to sit on his green potty.  He is 28 months and can easily pee, empty it, and rinse it by himself.  I'm not sure what the people who are complaining about pee going over the place but he can do it by himself with no problems.  Just teach the child to sit properly in a chair & make sure it's not hanging out of the potty (taught my son to tuck it in at 18 months so there really is no excuse).  He is about 32 pounds and 36 inches & I'm sure he will be using it at home for a while.  While he's been using the regular toilet for a while too at home, he loves his green potty.  BTW, baby bjorn makes 2 potties (and a ring too) this is the larger one.  If you are wanting a smaller one, there little potty is great but would not recommend it if you are starting with an older child as it is rather small (my son loved it at 15/16 months and will use it now but I don't think I would buy one that small for an older child).
+1	Got this for my daughter (shes 2).  I like it real well.  She is a smaller child and it fits pretty good.  She can sit on it and on feel like she's going to fall in.  I would recommend this to others.  I also got the step stool. She likes to run over to the sink and wash her hands when she's done....The step is nice too.BabyBjorn Safe Step - White(I got the pink one to match her seat)It stays put and is sturdy.
-1	I'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews. My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer! She'll sit on it, but it's so small. The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her. She's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her. When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open, but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she can't really sit on it comfortably.
+1	This was the 3rd potty we bought and I wish we had bought it the first time.  It is the perfect size for my 2 year old son.  I thought the smaller BabyBjorn potty was too small.  This is the potty I will be buying to put on our 2nd floor.
+1	This potty works very well for us.  My son likes that it is his size (we also have a potty seat for the toilet which he isn't so into).  It is light enough that he can move it himself, but the rubber grip on the bottom keeps it from slipping when he sits.  I can see how other children may have problems bumping themselves on the splash guard, which you can't remove, but this hasn't been a problem for him.  Also, we have had no problems whatsoever with pee going everywhere as other reviewers have.Pros:Easy to cleanGrips to the floorSturdyGood colorsRounded edgesCons:Can't remove the splash guardInside bowl can be removed easily by the child
+1	I really like this potty chair - the high back keeps kids from falling off the back, and the raised front is great for little boys. We had another chair but only the Bjorn seemed to be high enough to prevent a mess for our boys. I also have the shorter backed version, and they are both good for different reasons. This one feels a little sturdier, and the bucket is easy to empty. The non-skid on the bottom keeps it from sliding all around the floor.
+1	Bought it for my 9 month old baby girl, she can sit resting her feet on the ground and her back and arms are well comfortable too. This potty will grow with her.
+1	This is light, safe, easy to clean and attractive.  My daughter likes it and is having no trouble so far using it.  She can easily and safely get on and off it by herself or with help.  It is also easy to clean.
+1	fit as expected,,my baby love it .This potty chair doesn't come with all the whistles and bells like other potties. But is the best. When i was shopping for a potty, i read the reviews and then went to the store to &#34;explore&#34; for myself. i wasn't convinced of any other potty. why? 'cause all the others either didn't sit sturdily on the floor (and this is w/o a child sitting on it)or were difficult to clean. This potty is simple and sturdy, gets the job done, comfy (my picky daughter never complained, she likes the teddy bear logo on it), and so easy to clean. Never had a spill too. Besides, potty training should be as simple and natural as possible, so choose a simple potty. i have 2 of this item (1 downstairs and 1 upstairs, now thinking of using 1 at home and 1 for the car).there's plenty of space to stick stickers as a reward everytime she goes potty too
+1	I LOVE that this is "healthy" materials - HATE that it sticks to my sons bottoms when he stands and in 2 cases pee everywhere (one other case POOP EVERYWHERE!)I will keep the 3 that I purchased for him, but I did purchase one wood potty that I like much better too.Just trying to keep healthy the best we can.  I guess nothing is perfect...
+1	This is my 5th potty chair and so far the best for a boy that I have found.  The pee still splashes out occasionally, but far less than all the other brands.  It makes me so mad that they don't have boy-specific potty's.  The splash guards are always too small and they leak ( like our defective Thomas potty seat)  So I am happy to have this one as a big improvement.  My son is on the large side he is 34 pounds and 36 inches tall and just turned 2 last month. He fits on it just fine and likes that he can lean back.
+1	After extensive research, I finally settled on this potty chair and I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  I, like many other reviewers, was intially put off by the $22 price tag.The problem I have with many baby products today is that companies try to make something a "new concept" by adding bells and whistles or attempting to make things multi-purpose.  Don't get me wrong, I love technology and my daughter has tons of electronic gadgets, but potty chairs should not double as toys.  Nor do I care to have my child using her potty in the future to stand on to reach the sink.This is exactly what a potty should be... a potty and nothing else.  Its ergonomic design and rubber bottom makes it comfortable and stable, even on carpet.  It looks remarkably similar to a real potty because if its smooth, white finish.  When I got it home my 16-month-old daughter immediately knew what it was and wanted to sit on it.  She now loves to sit on the potty and this one appears to be very comfortable for her.In a nutshell, it is simply made, easy to clean and perfect for potty training.
-1	I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I was pretty disappointed over all.  My daughter is tall for her age but not particularly chunky or chubby.  In any case, every time she stood up from this potty chair she also brought a red mark from the circular opening on her bum. I thought it was a little narrow for her.  Sometimes when she stood up, the white part actually came up with her. I personally did not think this was a great potty chair.  I think this might be because I have a girl and not a boy, since there seems to be issue with other potty's splash guards.  In my case, my daughter did not find this seat comfortable and did not take to it at all.  I later bought her that Fisher Price one with the face and that sings. It's a little lower, but wider and the seat cannot come up with her. She loves the songs, though it's lower and it is actually wider, so even though she is tall, no problems. Again, don't have a boy so can't speak to the splash guard issue, but really this potty is nothing out of this world for me.  It's collecting dust in my hallway closet right now.
+1	Everything I read said to keep the potty as basic as possible.You can't get more basic than this potty and the winning factor for me is that it is so easy to clean.There aren't any cracks or crevices you need to worry about.I bought it long before I knew my child was ready to use it and placed it in the bathroom as someplace she can hang out while Mommy was in the potty.  If your child was like mine, she wanted to follow you everywhere, even the bathroom.She started sitting on her potty to emulate me.After a bit, she asked to take her pants off and that's how we started potty learning.Since the basin is one wrap around tub, I just life it off to clean and put it back.  No need to snap things or worry about cleaning crevices.I also like that it is the right size.  The back helped stabilize her when she was really small and now as an older toddler, it still fits her just fine.
+1	Easy to clean.The &#34;lip&#34; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty, but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the &#34;bowl&#34; off to pour the contents in the toilet.  Even my 2 (almost 3) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides. Makes it comfortable for the child, especially when we initially began using the potty.
+1	My son is a big kid (tall, 28 lb, one year old with chubby legs) and this potty fits him perfectly. He has already used it for #1 and #2. He does not mind sitting on it at all so it must be comfortable to him. Mess cleans out of it easily too.
+1	When my then 14 month old daughter started to sign "poop" and then within minutes would start going in her diaper, we knew that she was ready to start potty training. It took me almost 2 weeks of researching different potty's, reading various reviews (good and bad) and then finally deciding on this one. Our little one took to it immediately (not to mention the 10 potty books she had to read helped quite a bit too).Eventually, she would say "poop" and we'd rush her to her potty chair. I read many reviews on this one and I took any reported problems that parents had (of both boys and girls) into consideration. I was nervous about her accidentally sitting on the splash guard or watching for her bottom having a red ring after sitting a while or the seat sticking to her bottom whenever she tried standing up and spilling pee everywhere. Honestly, I haven't had any of those issues. Her bottom does have a pink ring on it from the impression of where she was sitting on the potty seat, but it's not like it's sore or that it's an actual bruise. I get one too whenever I use the toilet, so can't really understand why parents complained about that.This is a really good potty seat. It has a rubber bottom edge so it keeps the potty chair in place. It has a tall back support and some armrests which is really nice. The little inner potty cup is easily removed and cleaned instead of needing to pick up the whole thing.I didn't give it 5 stars because the potty chair is kind of short. My daughter is petite and I'm surprised that she's still kind of tall for this. I think it's still one of the best potty's out there.
+1	My 18 month old son enjoys sitting on his &#34;potty&#34;.  It seems very comfortable for him, and it is easy to clean.
+1	We practice EC and have used this potty chair and the toilet for pee and poop since our baby was an infant. Most every time the big people in the house  go to the toilet we put baby on her potty. We use cloth diapers and have changed very few diapers with poop.  Our baby has learned to tell us when she needs to go by pointing to her diaper or by removing her diaper.  A great tool for parents and kids!
+1	I love this potty, we have one upstairs and one downstairs.  My son doesn't mind using it, it is incredibly easy to wash, get one!
+1	Perfect size for toddler2 parts so no complicated set up (The bowl & seat)No small nooks or crannies that can build up moldDurable plasticPortableEasy clean upConCan potentially slide easily along floorCan also potentially be flipped over by toddler if not careful
+1	We have just started potty training my 22-month old, and haven't used this chair very much.  It is sturdy and doesn't look like it will slide on the floor or accidentally tip over.  It is a good size for a toddler and comes in lots of great colors. I bought this because I read many lukewarm reviews on the potty chairs that sing and light up and do fancy things like dispense stickers...we wanted something simple and basic, and this fits the bill. My only complaint is that the inner bowl, while very easy and quick to remove and clean, can be a blessing and a curse: when my daughter sits on it for any length of time, it sticks to her skin, and has almost spilled when she stands up too fast.  That is the only thing to watch out for.  Other than that, it is great!
-1	Great when my son was sitting down... now that he stands... junk.  If not right on target, you're going to have a mess every time.  Think pee puddle under the chair... and now imagine the smell.  Totally gross, and getting rid of ASAP.Skip.
+1	This potty chair is awesome! I have had this chair for about two weeks. I bought it for my sixteen-month-old daughter.  I also purchased Leslie Patricelli's "Potty" book in the same Amazon order. When the box arrived, I took it into my daughter's room (I had already cut through the tape) and we opened it together. She was so excited. We took this right into the bathroom, so she could see. I put the chair in our bathroom across from the toilet and the "Potty" book is on a stand next to her potty chair. She immediately sat down on it and opened her book.I didn't intend to start potty training her until after the holidays. I have been trying to get her to say the words "potty", "poop", and "pee". She hasn't said any of those words yet. However, she is starting to comprehend the words. She loves sitting on this chair and reading her "Potty" book. On an even better note, she has peed twice in the past two days, while sitting on her potty chair! I was so impressed!About the chair:It's so perfectly simple! It is just the base and the bowl that the poop and pee go into. The bowl has a fairly high and wide splash guard, but it's not so big that it is difficult for her to sit and get situated. So far nothing has splashed onto the floor. The design of the bowl keeps things from sliding down the sides when you empty it into the toilet. The bowl doesn't have anything to lock it into place, so be sure to teach your child not to play with it from the very beginning. As the description notes, the design is ergonomical and stable. The chair is high, wide, and well-curved. It would be difficult to tip over.On the (barely) downside. The seat is hard plastic and doesn't seem comfy. However, my daughter doesn't seem to mind. It would also be nice if there was a way of locking the bowl into the base so that curious children don't try to take the bowl out.
+1	My two year old loves this chair. We are just practicing sitting on it right now. It fits her well and it's easy for her to get on and off it. It doesn't slide around on the floor and she seems to be comfortable while using it.
+1	Easy to clean, low enough for kiddo, hole was large enough for #2, backing made for a good reading position for the kiddo while we waited for the pee pee to come out.
+1	We really like this potty chair, got this in pink color and it looks very cute. It's stable but at the same time very light. The back part is very comfortable i think, it lets ur baby lean back relax and concentrate on the important process :) also its very easy to clean, just take the white part out and wash it. We are very happy with this product.
+1	My daughter has loved her potty. She is 10 mo old and has enjoyed sitting on it. The second day we had it she went pee pee on it and we are now a week into having it and today she went potty 4 times on it at 10 MO OLD! I am so glad we have our BABYBJORN to help us EC.
+1	The size is perfect for our bathroom (which has about 4x4' of walking floor space), and the shape is great. It has a nice &#34;splash guard&#34; on the front, so I'm not worried about the little man peeing over the top. He has yet to use it successfully, but he has been interested in it since the day it arrived! Training techniques aside, it's a solid little training seat.
+1	This is working great for us.  So far she's pee'ed (spelling?) a few times and does not feel uncomfortable sitting here.  Definitely a great product.
+1	My child actually likes sitting on this so I assume it's comfortable. Haven't personally tried it myself! Easy to dump and keep clean so it's a winner in our book.
+1	My son and I love this potty. I never had a hard time training him to use it. In fact, I only told him once what to do, and he was using it since then. He seems to be very comfortable with it that he seems to actually enjoy sitting on it while making poo and playing his toy ramp & cars at the same time. He also likes using it without doing something else so I know its not about the toy. He loves that he can be independent & his potty makes him feel that. My son is 2 years old and weighs 32 lbs. Cleaning is also very easy, even without a liner. This happens when my son would use the potty on his own without a liner. I only have good words to say about this potty. I have no complaints at all.
+1	We got this to help us with elimination communication on our 6 week old. She really wasn't digging the in arms position and we weren't feeling confident holding her in it. When we first got this it was hit and miss if she would like it. Because she is so small still and can't sit on her own and the potty is a bit big for her to lean on the chair part, we sit her very close to the front and hold her upper body up. I realized when she has been bundled up and then we take her potty she didn't like the cold plastic on her legs. So we bought some leg warmers and problem solved. Now she is 9 weeks and on good days we are happily catching most of her potty needs. Right now we keep the potty on our bathroom counter facing the mirror and some lotion bottles, she's loves looking at herself and reaching for the bottles while going. When she's older we plan to keep it on the floor so she can reach it by herself.
+1	My husband insisted that our son would potty train with those on the adult toilet seat inserts.  We bought all different types.  Potty training just wasn't working.  I actually researched many of these potty chairs right here on amazon and the Babybjorn had the best reviews and comments, so I managed to convince my husband that we should at least try it.  Best decision ever.  My son's potty training excellerated.  Now he enjoys sitting on this potty.  It's the best height for him and he even likes emptying the receptical into the big toilet.  Easy to clean. Now my youngest likes to just sit on this potty, even fully clothed.  He feels like a big boy copying what his brother does.  Very glad we made the decision to go with this basic floor potty.
+1	Our daughter uses this every morning as part of early potty training. She has low muscle tone, so we needed a potty chair that would be supportive and comfortable enough for her, and this one does the trick. She seems very comfortable sitting on it, I think because of its high back and the little bump in front that kind of keeps her in the right position. I also like this chair because the little potty bucket is smooth, without many little creases, nooks or crannies where, um, germs might get stuck -- so it's very easy to clean. That's a relief for me!
+1	Thanks to Amazon's 90 day return policy, we bought 4 different potties for our boy to try. No, he didn't "use" them, just sat on them to test durability, comfort, and function.Durability - solid plastic. I'm not going to sit on it, but it handles a 32lb kid no problemComfort - No problem sitting on this potty. the raised back is very nice additionFunction - The most important aspect. The raised lip on the front is a MUST for boys. Other potties we tried the lip was not high enough (or not there), which could be a disaster. Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home. We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders, etc but don't use it. Avoid the "talking" potties and create your own reward system (M&M;'s work great or there are a ton of potty training apps for phones and tablets). You can also get one of the more basic, smaller potties to keep in your car for trips.
+1	This is a very nice potty chair.  It is a sleek, simple design, easy to clean, no annoying sounds or other bells/whistles.  I ordered it to get my child used to sitting on the potty (not starting training yet).  I have a small (18 pound) 1 year old and this seat was just a little bit too tall.  I ended up ordering the Baby Bjorn Smart Potty, which is a very similar design without the high back/sides, and it seems to be a much better size for my needs.  It appears that the bowls are interchangeable. I posted side-by-side photo of both of the potties for comparison purposes.
+1	I got this potty after reading reviews on all the potty's on Amazon. What a great potty. My 18 month old son loves it. He is just starting out with his potty training. He pooped and peed on the second day of training and just loves the idea on sitting bottomless on this potty. He has had zero issues with it and I have no complaints. Great potty!
+1	*Ever have your kid on the potty in a dim room and wonder whether he actually made anything yet?  I just realized I could stick my cell phone through the hole in the back of the BB potty, and it glows through the seat so I can see what's inside!This seat is an absolute must for potty training.  Right height, comfortable back to relax and let things happen etc, but let's get real - we care about the clean up, right?  NO POTTY beats this one for clean up.  The sturdy non skid big piece stays on the ground as you clean the bowl, or hold it up for a boy working on his stand-up pee.  I had one of those potties that had a little tray to catch the poop, but got rid of it because poop can exceed the height of that little tray, even for very little guys, if it's stacked just right.  If that happens, how are you supposed to pull the tray out without smearing it all over the potty?  This has a nice deep bowl that keeps everything dropping down.I've read reviews that said the front was too high and can hurt a baby, others say its too low and doesn't catch the pee.  I have two boys, and this was just high enough to teach them to point it down a bit, which was useful when they later used public toilets.  They have never had trouble avoiding it when sitting though, so have not hurt themselves on it.
+1	I bought two potties before I realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front.  I broke down and bought this.  This doesn't have the bells and whistles like some other potty.  But it's beauty is its simplicity.  he is able to sit and do his business, carry the urine/poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself (he was not even 2 yet!).  I would highly recommed the potty training book "Potty training in less than a day".  it's out of print but you might find an used copy on [...].
+1	This is a child sized toilet.  It is attractive looking.  We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house.  Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it.  I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse.  My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that.  I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet.  We are big fans of this.
+1	Having selected this chair based on the reviews here I felt I should give my own. This was for my first child, now 3 and we bought this over a year ago. He is fully potty trained now and still uses this seat and I think he'll be using it for a while to come. It cleans and disinfects very easily and still looks brand new. He's very comfortable in it and its a very very good fit. It was a year ago, and it still is. For the novice parent of boys, it doesn't matter how high they make the splash guard, boys need to point it down. That took some learning on my part. We have the Bjorn that fits over the potty too, but we've hardly used it. He and we love this one way too much and its so much easier for him to use the potty on his own.
-1	I started out my son with elimination communication (EC aka early start potty training, of which Amazon carries great books by 3 different offers on the subject) when he was 6 wks old.  We kept it up until he was 4 months old and then I stopped because my mother-in-law thought it was "weird" - I tried to start again when he was 6 months but he was already attached to his diapers.  I could really kick myself now that he's 2 and many many poop diapers later!  Anyhow we had the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty when we were doing EC and it worked great cuz we could manuver him and pee him sitting down.  The pee gaurd is in the opinion of more than just our family, TERRIBLE for toddlers!  After he bumped it sitting down I couldn't get him near the potty for weeks.  I am not usually into frills and over the top plastic toys but I love the fisher price potty we got him instead.  I didn't put batteries in it - too much for me.  I love it.  My son actually uses it.  It has a REMOVABLE splash gaurd.  Our boy pees standing up anyhow - just like Papa! It looks more like a grown up potty except it has a cartoon smiley face.  I thought the smiley face silly at first but since it makes my son like it more it kinda makes me happy now.  And the potty seat removes so you can put it on your toiletseat for easing toddlers nerves when moving onto to toilet training.  Not as simple-looking as the Baby Bjorn but a much better potty in many many ways.
+1	Sturdy, serves the purpose, plus it is stylish in design. I can't get my 2 year old to use it for anything else than playing with, so we've reverted to the toilet seat ring on the toilet which she will use to go potty.
+1	Our son just turned two and we have begun introducing him to his own potty.  This chair is great.Pros:1- Sturdy.  He leans forward to get a wayward car or his stuffed teddy and it does not tip forward with him2- Catches all of the day's product, nothing has escaped yet- the guard is tall enough.3- Easy to take the pot out and dump into the toilet but because he is sitting on it, no chance for him to pull it out and dump while he is sitting.4- Easy to clean (the most important?)Con:1- Once he has stuck to the pot and when he stood up quickly, it stuck to him and dumped.  A minor problem in the grand scheme of things and it has not happened since.We bought one for grandma's house and would recommend highly
+1	Why I love this toilet....it does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the toilets out there...but really, why do you need them? This one is easy to clean...must be pretty comfortable because my kid will sit on it and read in the bathroom...it is the perfect height...and has a nice seat back....best part, it doesn't tip over (yet at least). Not sure how it works for boys...but for a girl it worked well.
+1	We wanted a potty for our daughter to start using once day when she was about 7 months old. This one has been great - it isn't so big that her butt falls through the hole, but it definitely has room to grow. She seems to like sitting on it and using it and it is very easy to clean.
+1	I was very satisfied with the quality of this potty chair.  However, my daughter used it as a piano bench for her toy piano and nothing else.  Then one day I took her to a family restroom that had a little potty in it and she ran for it to go sit down.  I immediately bought her a potty chair that looked more like a real toilet and found that she actually was interested in potty training, she just didn't realize this chair was supposed to be a potty.
+1	I use cloth diapers and was anxious to at least get the BM's into the toilet instead of having to wash them. I bought this for my son when he was 8mths old and we have been using it for BM's. I am fortunate to be able to stay home with my son so I am in close contact with him and can tell when he is trying to go #2. As soon as I see his BM face (starts pushing, and eyelids get red) I quickly take off his diaper and sit him on this potty. It works great. With him being so small you do need to sit directly in front him and entertain with a song or a toy as he does his business but it is worth it. I don't always catch the BM's but have to clean a lot fewer ones by using the toilet.This seat is comfortable and I like the back part because he can sit back without falling over. If he is not positioned quite right he might pee outside but for the most part if you are watching closely it contains everything just fine. :)
+1	This was our second potty for my daughter as the first one was too difficult for her to sit on. We got it before 18 months and she is very small for her age, the other potty we had was &#34;the shortest on the market&#34; but bc of the design she had trouble. She had loved this potty since day 1 and she likes the little bear logo on the front. The only downfall ivories would be she can grab the basin and easily pull it out but she is pretty good about letting me do it. Like the gray color too.
+1	The seat is the perfect size for toddlers, contoured to be comfortable, and designed to be easy to clean.  Your little one will sit and be situated as i the same body position as an adult on a real toilet.  The raised front of the white part serves as both a pommel/hand rest and a splash guard.  The white bowl is deep enough to prevent most splashes.  The back and arms are high enough to make your little one feel secure and allow him/her to rest against them.  The seat does not slide on tile flooring.  When your baby is done, just lift the white bowl and clean.  Perfect potty training chair.  Fits almost anywhere and is very light.
+1	I find these cloth diapers very useful. I use them as burp cloths and to have handy in case of spills or other baby related messes. They are absorbent and comfortable to use. They are soft, so they don't scratch my babies face when I clean his mouth. I first bought 1 package and then went back for more. They are inexpensive and very useful.
-1	I'm not sure how other people can give these a good review, or maybe I don't know what they're supposed to be used for? Certainly not diapers!  My mother recommended that I get some flatfold cloth diapers just for cleaning up messes, using for burp pads, etc.  The ones she meant were the cushioned ones, however. These are the consistency of cheesecloth - I mean like, see-through! I'm returning immediately.
+1	A friend recommended I register for these although she knew I was planning to use disposable diapers.  I accidentally registered for the diapers with the absorbent centerfold, and fortunately,  received these.  They are large -  27"x 27" square and are essential for baby care.  I still use them every day and my son is almost a year old.  I used them to line his cradle and changing-table when he was first born and going through many diapers a day.  They work great as burp cloths, and are superb for wiping up other food messes.  Additionally, I found they work as a light blanket during the summer months.  Extremely durable, fold-up rather small for travel, and launder well.  101 uses, I love them!
-1	The can never be used as DIAPERS!  They are cheese cloth.  In fact they may have more holes than cheese cloth does.  There is no way that these diapers will hold anything that they are going to need to hold.  Don't waste your money.
+1	these are great. got them in 2009 for my son - never used as a diaper...  these came in handy in a bath, and when baby was falling asleep he would use it to cover himself . Now with my daugher I am using another pack of these - would recommend
-1	These are just too thin to be used as diapers.  They are also a strange shape which makes them difficult to fold to be used as diapers.  I don't use them.  They are just sitting in a drawer.  I think I will try to use them as burp cloths as they are useless to me right now.
+1	I'm a first time mother, and no one told me about using cloth diapers for just about everything (apparently all mothers know this).  My friend bought me a pack for my shower, and I now use them for burp cloths, lap pads, covering my son when changing him (another mother's secret--to prevent being urinated on), etc.  Apparently they make great dust rags when baby grows up!!
+1	I do not use these as diapers, but I couldn't live w/o them.  When my baby was really little, I used them on the changing pad to keep from having to change the changing pad cover constantly.  These are much easier to change and wash than those covers.  These are also the best burp cloths.  My daughter has really bad acid reflux, and not many burp cloths can stand up to a good spit up.  I go through about 5 a day.  They are VERY absorbant!
+1	These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house.
-1	Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby.  But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought "cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations."I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality.  After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my "diapering diapers" for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!
+1	These are the only bottles I use and they work well.  They are very durable & dishwasher safe. I have a medela pump also. My daughter is breastfed and feeds from these well, except for with the slow flow nipples - I recommend a fast flow nipple unless you want to take over a half hour to feed your baby while he/she struggles to get the milk out.  I should mention that she is not picky (becasue some babies are)about what type/brand of nipple she uses as long as the flow is not too slow.
+1	This is really handy with the mini electric pump that I have. I can pump straight into the bottles. I just use the bottle occasionally so this item works great for me. The nipples are a fast flow so the first time I fed my baby, the milk flow was too fast. I just picked up geber nuk slow flow nipples and it's perfect for my baby.
+1	Working full-time and pumping at work and at home.  Needed the extra set.  Didn't hurt when I saw them come with the nipples for those emergency feedings in the car!
-1	The bottle quality isn't great for the price.  Dr. Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style.  So you can pump and use, just as you would with these bottles. If you use regular bottles, the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in. Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.99 to pour into other brands of bottles.  I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey, when I use up all of those, I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles.
+1	I needed to pump when I went back to work and I bought a couple of these on top of those that were provided with the Medela Pump In Style. They are very resistant, easy to clean, and the rings and caps are very useful.I only put 4 stars because the nipples are useless if your baby is already using another brand, and I would have prefered another bottle and accessories instead.
-1	I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right?  Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding.  Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now).  I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage.  I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those
+1	we used these bottle because they are compatible with the medela pump.  the 5oz capacity is much better than the tiny 2oz ones.  my wife was very happy when they came.  I would check to make sure these don't have bisphenol A (BPA), we didn't know about back when we got them.  fast shipping.
+1	I love medela bottles, I love that they are BPA free. I love this product, I like the way it looks, the only thing I HATE are the bottle nipples. They look horrible and my two month old daughter does not like them at all. I went online and got other medela nipples, those she likes.
+1	These are great to put under a Pack-N-Play, or on top of a changing table. Or even to change baby on the floor, or on the go. They are soft, absorbent, and portable.
-1	i got these to put on my bed for my son's morning massage-cuz by now it's no secret what little boys do once those nappies come off! the first time i used it i seriously used the expression "let's see how good these really are"...only to be terribly disappointed: upon turning him over (yes he did let out a dose)i found i had really let my child lay in a puddle!! this o so absorbent pad really did nothing but allow for a greater area of redistribution. i even ventured to put my hand into it to see how much was absorbed n literally had stuff dripping from my fingers!!this was a waste of my money. i am back to using a regular sheet folded over.
+1	I love these pads! After reviewing many reviewers I decide to buy one and try it. It is so soft and absorbent! Mine has not pilled and has gone through many washings. I ended using it in my diaper bag since the changing places in public restrooms don't always appear clean. It fits so much better in my diaper bag than a bulky changing pad and my daughter likes better since not cold. I bought more of these and left one in her cosleeper for leaks and as a changing pad at night so no trips to nursery. Another was placed downstairs with wipes and diapers in a basket for quick changes on the couch and everyone loved using them.Great price and you will get your moneys worth out of them. They go anywhere and we left one at grandmas and one in the car for changing on the seat when not convenient to change elsewhere. Will use for next bundle of joy!
+1	I bought it for the playpen, which it says it fits.  It doesn't.  It is a little to big, but I managed to make it work.  I bought it because I can use it on his crib or it says a twin bed, which is would be too small for.  It does it's job at keeping the bed clean from wetness which is all I need.
+1	This pad can be used for anything! I use one under my sheets in the area my son likes to spit up on, under him during &quot;let's give that touschi some air&quot; time, and as a take along for diaper changes...no one's going to tell you but they secretly don't want you to change your baby on their bed or sofa! Go figure.Also, unlike their cousin the 'Quilted Crib Mattress Pad' it doesn't pill up enough to care.
+1	This pad fits my Arm's Reach Co-sleeper great. I bought this to put between the mattress and sheet. The pad gives it more cushion and will absorb any leaks if they happen. I washed it and the pad washed great.
+1	I bought two of these and I just love them.  I use both of them at the same time--one for his head, the other for his butt. They do the trick of catching spit-up, vomit, and leaking diaper problems.  These pads save me a lot of time beacuse I don't have to worry about doing the sheets all the time. They're getting a little fuzzy now that they've been through the wash a few times, but for $7, I think these pads are a great buy!!
+1	I have several of these - one under the sheet on the crib and one under the sheet to my pack and play.  LOVE THEM!  Great item to have!
+1	What I like about these pads are the way the don't slip around at all when you lay them down on carpet or flannel sheets.  My daughter has started resisting being changed on her changing table, so I use these pads to change her on differnt floors in our house.  And awhile back when she had a particularly upset stomach and lots of diaper blow-outs we kept her on top of these pads all day, whether she was sleeping in her crib or anywhere.  They worked wonderfully.  They come clean easily and I don't mind that the cotton pills up.  That helps to keep it from shifting on carpeted floors.
+1	These pads have definitely come in handy. They are super absorbent, very easy to clean and a perfect size for many different things. When my daughter first came home I used them under her, on my counter near the sink to sponge bathe her. I have one on my changing table that came with my Pack n Play. I also use on on the floor under her activity gym (Sparkling Symphony Gym)since it doesn't include a mat. I also have two at Grandma's for changing and laying on the bed. They are used frequently and really do hold up to alot of abuse. I would recommend buying a pack even if you don't think you'll need them because I guarantee they will be put to good use.
+1	I love my pad, I use it under my bassinet sheet.  It has proven to be very durable.  I also have the mattress pad made by this company as well.  Worth every penny!
+1	These pads are wonderful!!  I began using them for my daughter in both her portable crib and regular crib as an infant.  Now that she has moved into a "big girl bed" at 2 I also use them under her sheet to protect her mattress for those occasional nights when she wets through her diaper.  They are great and have held up wonderfully wash after wash.  Very affordable and very versatile.
+1	We have tried so many sippy cups over the years and these are the best. My kids are 6 1/2 years apart and I used these sippy cups for my oldest. For my second child we used Nuk silicone spout cups for awhile but he kept chewing the spouts. They were getting expensive to replace. I tried other hard spout cups but he didn't like them. I remembered my daughter liking these and looked around but couldn't find them. Looked on Amazon and so glad that I found them. My son loves these. They are easy to clean, don't leak and he happily drinks out of them. I have ordered several packs of them. All have been the blue and green as pictured except my last order I got purple and orange prints. I highly recommend these cups.
+1	These have been around for a long time, and it's because they're the best. We have several different kinds of sippy cups, but these are the most dependable and the easiest. Definitely a favorite in our household.
+1	My child at a year old can sip out of them but a lot does come out.  He is getting better now after a few months of having them.  He throws this on our hard floors and nothing comes out!  It's a great cup that way, totally spillproof!  Playtex does make insulated ones which in my opinion are a lot better for two reasons.The first reason is that my childs hands do not get cold while sipping from cup and second the drink stays a lot colder a lot longer.  The valves are easy to put in and take out, my child only has water and milk still so I am not sure how well they will work for juice.
+1	Last year when I was pregnant, I asked other moms which cups and bottles to use.  A few told me playtex, but most told me Avent bottles and sippy cups were the only way to go.  Well, I decided to go Avent, and here I am writing a review for a playtex sippy cup.  Avent sippy cups are hard to hold, difficult to drink from when the cup is not filled to capacity, a pain to clean, and worst of all they leak.  The spout leaks (nothing magic about those cups) and the collars can leak too.  I finally decided after 5 months of using Avent magic cups with little success, to give the &quot;hard to use&quot; (as one mom had classified) playtex cup a try.  The difference was astounding.  My daughter could easily drink from this cup on the first try.  The cup is easy to clean (its only 3 pieces as opposed to the 5 or 6(w/handles) pieces for the avent cup), assemble and use.  I'm sorry I didn't at least register for a pack of these when I was pregnant.  I should mention that I
+1	The only time I've had one of these sippy cups leak is from operator error.  I have two kids ages 4.5 and 2.5 and have used several different brands of sippy cups and these are by far the best.  I've gotten rid of most of the sippy cups in my house but did keep these around for when my 2.5 yr old wants a drink of water in her bed at night or if my neices or nephews need one when they come over.  I loved these so much, I couldn't bring myself to get rid of them!
+1	My wife purchased these from another store for more than twice the price so I decided to bring down the cost average after we found out that they do not leak. There is a small rubber piece that fits in the spout to control the speed that the liquid comes out. After your child gets old enough you can eliminate the rubber piece. I think these are great to use as soon as you stop using bottles. After you stop using, the rubber flow control piece you can use them until your child grows out of sippy cups or you lose them. Great choice. Highly recommended.
+1	It said colors may vary but I got the same as shown.  Nothing exciting and does the same function, made well, but looks dull, very dull.... Wish you can pick out your own but these will do for now.
+1	My son needed more replacement valves as his seemed to all dissapear down the garbage disposer. Well I ordered these and got PINK cups instead of the blue/green shown. Oops. I really didn't think colors vary would vary between sex's - I assumed wrongly they'll all be unisex. Well he won't use them of course, but that's fine my 3 year old daughter just added them to her collection and I will pick up more cups for him somewhere else. Cups work fine though.
+1	These are very convenient if your child is already using the Avent bottles. If you use a Medela pump, you can get an adapter and pump straight into these containers, eliminating a step in the breastmilk collection chain.I also find that the small sizes are convenient, especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out of one or both breasts.I didn't give this product five stars, though, because, really, these are just four more Avent bottles with a sealing disc. If you have a bunch of bottles anyway, you can just buy a pack of sealing discs for about $4 and use those instead.
+1	These are fantastic for freezing/storing/reheating breast milk.  Unlike some of the reviews I read, I have experienced no leaking thusfar.  I use a Medela pump and transfer my milk into these containers because they have proven to be so wonderful (and they are acrylic, so reheating is much easier).  My only complaint is that they are slightly too small.  I usually pump more than 4 but less than 8 oz. and so I am forced to either use two containers or sacrifice my milk (which is too precious!).  However, I can deal with the smaller size because overall it is such a great product!
+1	These storage bottles are great because you can use them to store breast milk or formula. I like making a few bottles at night then later at night as I need them I warm a bottle take storage top off and add a nipple and I am ready to feed my daughter. I love all the avent products because of how easy everything is to use.
+1	I use the Medela pump - but their thin bottles and simple caps don't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh. I love the heavy Advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle.
+1	Love this containers.  These work well with the Avent on the Go breast pump system.  I haven't had any problems with freezing them and they haven't cracked. Love the fact that they are small containers (4oz) so they freeze well and when it's time for the milk to be defrosted it doesn't take long.  I plan to make my own babyfood and I am going to use these containers.  LOVE THEM
-1	We have purchased 3 inflatable snug-tubs from Kelgar. The infant size tub was fine, and still works okay after 2 years. However, the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak. The first one we bought had a very slow leak; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak, so we bought another one, thinking we wouldn't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.Wrong!!The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size snug-tub. At first it was so slow, it just meant we'd have to reinflate it once in a while; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it won't last through one bathing without going limp. After the second flop, I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement. They never responded to my friendly letter. When I finally called (took me a while to get around to it; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now!), they were totally unhelpful.The woman who answered at "Customer Service" kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns, and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer. Way to stand behind your products, dudes!Then when I called the retalier (Right Start) just now, they said that it's not their responsibility to handle a replacement, it's the manufacturer's-- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she's ask her boss and look into it more, just to see if there is anything they can do.I'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers, especially repeat customers such as myself. I mean, come on, how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy??However, since that is their attitude, you're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life (non-virtual) retailer with a decent 90-day return policy, such as Babies-R-Us or Target, so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement. That's what we'll be doing from here on out.So long, Kel-Gar. The tub was "just ducky" but your service was DOA!Update: No go on the replacment. Big surprise.Although not quite as cushy as this tub, I would highly recommend getting your baby or toddler the PRIMO EuroBath instead. We got it after having to give up on inflatables, and it is roomy, comfortable, and DURABLE, unlike Kel-Gar's products. 4.5 stars with 750 reviews on Amazon- you can't beat that!PRIMO EuroBath Pearl White
+1	This is great! It's so much nicer than the hard plastic tubs. My 6 month old doesn't slide around in this and it's easy for me to rest my arm on the tub while washing her. (Couldn't do that with the plastic tub.) Easy to fill up and easy to clean up. It even has a suction cup so it doesn't slide around in the tub. (I also use that for hanging up so it dries out after every bath.) This tub just makes bathtime much easier!
+1	I had previously purchased another tub because it was a few dollars cheaper but soon regretted it once received. The tub had two pouches to but the soap and shampoo. But the one thing i needed was a drain. The dirty water built up and the only way to get it out is to tilt it up so it can pour out. Such a hassle while washing a 9month old. Not with this one though. I can fill the tub up for him to play and splash and allow it to drain out when its time to wash. Great, so my son don't soak in dirty water which he does pee in.
+1	I was worried about this purchase reading all the reviews.  So far so good.  My 9 month old son loves the water we use this in the tub for bath time where he splashes and has fun. I bought the Safety 1st Splash Infant Bath Cushion, Blue to go in it.  I use that sometimes as I don't find the bottom of the tub that slippery, my son stands up in it and doesn't slip.But I was worried about safety so I purchased the cushion.We also use it for a swimming pool, sort of.  We have had some very hot days so I take it out side on my deck putting a old blanket underneath & he just sits in it and plays.I like it also when he has diaper rash as I can put the baking soda in the water to help dry it up and the height of the tub allows me to get it high enough over his butt.
+1	We were in that in between stage for the bath. My son was way to big for the baby tub. But at nine months to small for the real thing.  I did not need a tub that had slots for the shampoo because then my Son spends all of his time trying to play with the shampoo. This works great. Soft, blows up easily, roomy but not too roomy. This is a good product.
+1	My baby had outgrown our hard plastic tub and was uncomfortable in it.  I got this tub as a replacement.  After reading another customer's review I also purchased a sponge for the bottom and have had no problems with him slipping under water.  It smelled VERY STRONGLY of plastic so I had to wait a couple of days to use it, I recommend airing it out.  But once it's blown up, it's ready to go.  It's a little difficult to fill since it's so puffy, I have trouble getting it under the tub faucet but since I need to test the water temperature anyway, I just cup my hands and let the water run into the tub like that.  If you had a tub hose or something it would be easier.  My son loves this tub.  He lays back and luxuriates in his bath and it's very cute to see him &#34;relaxing&#34;.  (8 months old).  The suction cup on the back is awesome for hanging it up out of the way in the shower when we're done with it.  We keep it blown up and don't use the drain plug, we just tip it up to drain it because I read another review that the drain plug got warped and started to leak.  I'm avoiding that by just tipping it up to pour the water out.  Working perfectly so far!!  :)
+1	My daughter had the munchkin duck tub for awhile until it broke. Well...she is almost two and I was thinking of getting another one or bath mats. Our tub is very slippery. So I found this one and the age limit was past 2years old so I thought I would try it out. I really think it is a good transition to the tub. It is not real deep and she has lots of room but it still makes her feel safe and secure.
+1	Bottom blow up cushion doesn't stay inflated and the plug doesn't really drain the water effectively however it fits snuggly in my tub and my daughter doesn't mind her baths in here. Has transitioned our bath times from sink to big girl tub like I wanted so job well done. I also like the suction cup to hang the tub to bath side for drying purposes. Good product and woukd recommend.
+1	It's easily inflated and my baby has a blast sitting in this thing.  Some reviews mention a slippery bottom but we haven't had any problems with it.  And on the rare occasion when my baby accidentally bumps her bead on the side, well, it's all soft and bouncy so she never hurt herself.
+1	When my daughter outgrew her infant tub, we went through a few different devices to try to give her a safe bath. She is VERY active so she doesn't like to sit for very long. We first tried the bath ring, that was a disaster. This snug tub has worked wonderfully. She is able to stand in it and splash around without us worrying about her breaking her head if she slips. It's very safe and fits snugly in our shower. I highly recommend this tub, especially if you have toddler who won't sit through baths!
+1	Great fit , cute , safe for baby but deflated so fast. My husband has to re-pump it every couple days
+1	very nice product
+1	I purchased this inflatable tub for my son because I wanted to have a portable tub for when I went traveling with him. This tub is great, I even use it at home. I started using this tub when my son was 6 months, he is now 9 months old. Now that he sits up on his own, it's a lot easier to bathe him. I like using this tub better than an infant bath seat because I can wash him more thoroughly, all around instead of having his legs fastened in a tub seat. If you travel, it's a great idea to get an inflatable tub, it's portable, and quite sturdy.
-1	This is a nice, big tub, but the bottom never held air. Decided to keep it anyway, but then after a day it developed a slow leak which made the whole thing pointless. Returned it.
+1	I researched a lot of tubs before buying this one, and I am happy with my decision.  I wanted the biggest one available so he would be able to use it for awhile before growing out of it.  It has wide sides, is tall and long.  It is pretty good with being nonslip.  The only downside is I haven't been able to get the suction cup to work to allow it to hang dry so I just set it up in the tub to let it dry.
+1	My little one outgrew her baby tub around 5 months old. I purchased this item and read the previous reviews. Great item...its cushy for baby and quite large for her and her toys :)  Another great thing is even if the suction cup is wet, it still sticks to the bath tub wall without any problems and doesn't deflate easily (it's been about 2 months and still have not had to inflate the tub since I've purchased the item).Only CON is that as a previous reviewer had mentioned, the tub is slippery. So I bought the Green Spouts bathmat to put in the tub so my daughter does not slip and slide everywhere.
+1	The DEX Pillow is great.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am 21 weeks along.  The pillow is not overly big and fits nicely under the belly.  I tried the fully body boppy pillow, but had trouble sleeping with it and I had trouble with having to adjust it again after turning over.  This pillow is easy to change sides with.  Before pregnancy I slept on my belly.  I find that this pillow has really helped me transition from being a belly sleeper to a side sleeper.
-1	Too small.  It felt worthless for what I wanted.  I ended up buying a 12&#34; 7.5&#34; tall wedge with memory foam that is a lifesaver!
+1	OMG this was the best thing I ever bought while pregnant, i used it for holding up my stomach while sleeping on my side it was invaluable. It stopped pulling and stretching of my stomach, kept my legs apart when I put it between my knees. If you are a man reading this with a pregnant wife, get it for her. I promise she will love it and you.
+1	I think we bought this for $8. I was in the market for a snoogie but couldn't bring myself to pay $60 for a pillow I would only use for a few months. I am 7 months along and I didn't realize that I needed to 'lift' my belly a bit. Works great. A lot more sturdy than I thought. I'm glad it's not memory foam because I need a 'lift' not to sink in. I gave it 4 stars only because I have 2-3 more months to go in my pregnancy.A great buy! A great little size that does the job.
-1	I tried to use this while pregnant but for me it was too thick and firm.  However it did make a great tool for propping up our newborn's mattress because he needs to sleep elevated due to reflux.
-1	I was terribly uncomfortable and needed some support for my baby belly, but this was not even close to the answer to my problem. I'll say it again because these are the only two words worthy of writing about this product:Terrible and pointless.
+1	bought this for the last 4 months of pregnancy and it really helped comfort levels during nap and night sleeps. does tend to squish into a set position but i liked that. Really nice for the price.
+1	My daughter is pregnant with twins and it was getting to be very difficult for her to sleep.  This is a very small wedge, but I don't think you'd want something any bigger or softer to support a growing belly.  She was using it mostly on the couch while using a microbead body pillow in bed.  When she was admitted into the hospital at 31 weeks in pre-term labor, this was the first thing she asked her husband to bring.  She has made it another week and this little pillow gets a constant workout.  Sometimes it is under her belly.  Sometimes it is wedged into her back.  Sometimes it just helps to support the arm that has the IV in it.  We are hoping to make it another 4 weeks or more, so I think I got my money's worth out of this.  I'm glad I found something to make her a bit more comfortable.ETA:  Found another use for the pillow.  It makes an outstanding ramp to launch hot wheel cars!  Entertaining a 4 year old in a hospital room is hard, but this pillow has assisted us in doing just that.
+1	I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help.  However, this didn't really help me sleep better at all, if anything it made it worse.  It was very uncomfortable.  Maybe I'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger.***UPDATE***  Now that I am 33 weeks, I use this support pillow every night.  Once my tummy got bigger, the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much.  Now I can't sleep without it!
+1	This headrest is perfect.  Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this.  When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward.  Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy.  At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this.  I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible.  It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car.  For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat.
-1	I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower.  I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest.  Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat.  Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury.  The product may be a fine one, but I found an &quot;extra&quot; one to be unnecessary.
-1	I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!
+1	This is great. We started our boy on strawberries with this, as well as bananas (frozen) and frozen little cubes of baby food for him when he was teething. This is a brilliant idea. No worries about him choking as he began to navigate food.
+1	My baby loved this, even though he won't use a single of the many teethers we've tried.  This is the only thing that soothes his teething pain that he'll take.  We use with frozen apples, even ice cube pieces.  Worth the price, as it WORKS
+1	I purchased this product a few months ago despite all the bad reviews and so far I have not had a problem with it. My son loves it. I've had this sitting in the sink (dirty) for days sometimes and I have never once had a problem cleaning it. The best way I figured out on cleaning this product is to just clean it with hot water and dish detergent and clean out the inside really good with the same type of brush that you use to clean out the bottles. Even the bananas come out and who cares if its a little stained as long as you know that its clean. I was in the store the other day and saw a similar version of this item made by Munchkin at less than half the price of this one. I wish I found it before because this baby safe feeder is a little outrageous in price for this kind of item. I would still  definately recommend this product though.
+1	This is THE BEST little baby gadget yet.  The first time I saw it I thought, "What will they think of next..." but now that my 2 year old and nearly 1 year old are putting everything in their mouths this is an indispensable part of our home.  It's great for teething because you can stuff it with cold fruit and your baby will love sucking away while getting all the juice out of grapes, pineapple, watermelon, even strawberries!  It's great for regular feeding too, since you can now place larger pieces of food inside to give your child a taste of such things as meat, fresh brocolli, etc.  The easy to clean mesh bag does get stained pretty quickly, I tried to boil mine clean with gentle soap and water, but after just two weeks of steady use, the carrots and bananas had stained the bag permanently.  The refill package costs nearly as much as the unit itself, but it's worth the total investment for peace of mind that your baby will NEVER choke on anything they eat through this feeder.  I suggest bringing an extra along in the diaper bag -- it's a great thing to have on trips.
-1	I bought this when my daughter was 6 months old to help her learn to chew. It is very flimsy and floppy when food is in it. She just played with it (flipping it around) thinking it was a toy. She is teething also so I thought it would definitely go in her mouth often, but she enjoyed throwing it around instead.
+1	We started using this feeder when my son was just 3 months old.  He loved the flavor of melon, but we were uncomfortable with letting him bite on a piece of melon for fear he might choke.  The baby feeder was the perfect answer.You can cut up just about anything and place it in the feeder bag.  We even put lightly frozen grapes in it when my son was teething.  We used it mostly for fruit, especially melon, grapes, pears, and strawberries.  I will admit that it can be messy to use this feeder, but it was totally worth it to us to give our son a chance to learn to love fresh fruits.  Enjoy!!!!
+1	This was absolutely fabulous for my family.  We used it with frozen fruit for teething, and just about any snacks my baby wanted to eat.  I never had to worry about her choking and it was so easy to clean.I truely reccomend this product for worry free feeding!
+1	I bought this to help with teething and help my baby explore new food without choking.  Overall , it's pretty good.  I think you can buy this one and not the "Starter Kit."  All you really need is one set.  I have tried it with ice, which she loves, and peas and a frozen peach.  It is a huge mess, which I can deal with.  The main issue I have with it is that the mesh is pretty thick so it's hard for her to actually get any food out of it.  It is easy to clean and she likes it overall.  I wouldn't say this is one of my indispensable baby items though.
+1	I love this idea and  so does my son. He had his first local gorn apple at 5 months old thanks to this product. He gnawed that thing to death. We keep one at home and oone in the diaper bag for when we got out. It is easy to clean and is one less thing to worry about. Of course supervision is still required but makes you feel safer knowing the baby is eating healthy food and staying safe from choking.
-1	It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams. I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean.
-1	The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy.
-1	I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them.  These were just about the worst!!  My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding.  I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped.  I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.  I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them.
-1	I was not impressed with these storage bags.  I prefer to use the other brands that offer ziplock type closure.  This brand is harder to close, more time consuming and wasteful (due to spilling)
+1	If I had to freeze breastmilk, this was great because I didn't have to put a lot of plastic containers in the freezer (we could use them to feed the baby instead).  They were easy to dispose of if they outdated (there is a place to label them with the date).  I usually put 3 of them in a freezer bag as a double layer of protection against leaks and freezer burn.  None ever leaked for me.  They thaw easier and faster than in hard plastic or glass containers, too.  Very convenient.
-1	If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others.
-1	These bags leave a lot to be desired.  They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them.  They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer.  The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on.  And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside.  All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet.
+1	There seem to be many negative reviews for these bags, but I have no serious complaints about them.  I have stored milk nearly 50 times using the Medela bags and have been completely satisfied.  They are sturdy and hold up well when being reheated.  However, I do dislike the fact that the way they are closed is to insert a little trash bag tie into the two pre-cut holes and then fold over and over and twist together until tight.  I store my milk in tupperware and then enclose in large freezer ziplocks and have not had any problem with the milk being corrupted.  The way they close is annoying because it doesn't freeze flat at all and I can only store 3 bags of milk per container- thus taking up tons of space in the freezer.  When I heat these up in a pot or under hot water I never have to double bag or worry about leaks and that is what matters most to me.  I recommend these bags and will continue to use for the remainder of my time breast feeding.
-1	I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often.  What a waste!!  The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective.  You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent.  In additon to this, the cost is ridiculous.  The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof.  They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart. These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design. Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags.
+1	I have a Britax Chaperone infant carseat and the base has an excellent lock off feature built in. However I could not get it so tight that it would move less than an inch.  After easily installing the Mighty Tite, it's like the base is a part of the car. It doesn't move at all. I am not a particularly strong or large person and it was a breeze to install. I highly recommend this product.
+1	The mighty-tite is a simple ratchet device, like you see on a come-along or truck tie down. Very simple to operate, but it takes some getting used to with certain seatbelts. On the old center seatbelts (no shoulder harness) they are a breeze. I put both the main belt and the &quot;extra&quot; strap that you pull to tighten into the ratchet, and crank that puppy right down. Solid as a house, and putting the &quot;extra tail&quot; into it keeps it from loosening.Plus side: man, is this thing tough. And simple to operate.Minus side: some car seats don't have enough room under the base for this thing. Also, the new shoulder harnesses really torque the seat sideways, and this thing only makes it worse. I don't like using it with a shoulder harness belt unless it's dead center of the car, because the extra torque tends to make the seat crooked. Finally, getting it to release is kind of a pain. You have to crank the ratchet a partial turn, hold down the yellow lever, and pop a button while holding it down. Doesn't always work on the first try. Now, a ratchet is not supposed to open easily, so it's no big deal, but it takes some work and getting used to. Perhaps they need some more development on the release.
-1	Don't buy this. It's not safe, can cut your seatbelt, and kill your child.You need to get a good install without this dangerous product.
+1	I am a big guy, and even when I pushed down on the base of our Graco seat, I could not get the seat installed tight enough. A couple of clicks on the Mighty-Tite was all I needed to fix that!This device is excellent, and I can't possibly imagine anyone breaking it like some reported here, the device weighs a lot (a good thing) and feels extremely sturdy.
+1	We own these sheets and they are great specially for my nephew..they seem "thin" but actually they are not to thin...i washed them many times from baby puke...these sheets has saved our travel yard from the evil smell of vomit! and i put a light weight blanket under him (on top of the sheet.) when he was a newborn/1month old...these sheets kept our play yard very clean!! and we love them and will buy more when baby #2 comes! we also have the yellow one and this green one..they both get used daily and washed daily (if puke happens) and we love the easy on and easy off!
-1	While it looks like it would be a great color, it's poorly made (thread count must be super low) and when it comes out of the drier, it has "balls" collected over it which also makes the sheet not-so-soft.  Go for the white!  I have a couple of white pack 'n play sheets and they are holding up much better!!
+1	I bought this item (in a different color) two years ago for my son.It is NOT waterproof- but what SHEET is?!  I recommend purchasing a 27" size BRU Especially for Baby Brand waterproof pad to go under the sheet (Just like you would buy a waterproof cover for your crib mattress!).  The sheet will hold the pad in place and fit perfectly over top both the pad and mattress.This sheet is durable and launders easily.I was so pleased with this product, I would purchase it again!  In fact, I did!  I am expecting TWINS, so I purchased another sheet in this color and also TWO of the smaller size for my two Graco Travel Lite Cribs/PNP's.Good job, Graco for coming up with yet another GREAT product!
+1	I really like this sheet. It matches the colors of my pack 'n' play really well. I have a kolcraft and it fits perfect. It has been spit up on about a million times and has been washed about a million more. It hasn't faded at all and is very durable. I would definitely recommend this sheet!
+1	I also almost didn't buy these sheets because of the reviews on this site, but I couldn't find another brand either, so I picked up two of these in navy.The sheets are a bit on the thin side (they are the thinnest sheets we own for him), but since our son has been sleeping in the bassinet in our room since day one, they are the only sheets he's ever slept on. They are okay sheets that are holding up very well, even through numerous washings. Oh, and they aren't elasticized, but it is so tricky to get them on the bassinet, I have no worries that they will come up (we haven't used the play yard feature yet).By the way, we've been using them all through a hot Colorado summer; if this were winter I would definitly be looking for something softer and cozier.
-1	Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet.  Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality??Also, keep in mind your wash loads.  I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels.  Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry.  Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry.
-1	We have the Saratoga P&amp;P and I've been very disappointed with the sheet we bought.  It's been so bad that we haven't used it yet.  The material is very rough and the sheet doesn't fit well when the mattress is in the bassinet position.
+1	We have the Graco Clarion Pack N Play and this sheet fits perfectly.  Can't understand why there are so many negative reviews about the fit and wear of this sheet. It fits our model perfectly and has withstood many washings well.  It is thin, but we haven't found that to be a problem.
-1	I regret not following the advice of the majority of reviewers on this one. These really are terrible sheets. I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they're manufactured by the same company. Boy was I wrong. They don't fit the pad very well regardless if it's laying flat for the playpen or if it's set up for the bassinet. Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet doesn't stay put very well at all. They are also cheaply made. Thin isn't even the word. It's upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand. I'm going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere. As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet. The pad wipes down well and if i'm going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her. Since she's always wrapped in a blanket she doesn't mind going w/o the sheet.
-1	These sheets are not good at all.  I am a big fan of Graco products, but not these!  They are thin, and not soft at all.  I ended up making my own sheets...all you have to do is get a piece of flannel and hem it and make the corners, they don't need elastic since the mattress has bending points in it.  Plus, a lot cheaper!
+1	O.k., yes it is thin, it is not the softest out there, but it does the job. To add comfort I have a waterproof pad under it which I think is a must in playards anyways because it is not easy to clean the matress pad they come with.I have had no problems with bleeding, and I wash it very often and it has held up fine.
+1	They absorb well. However, you will have to wear a padded bra in order for the seams on these pads not to show and/or look pointy.
-1	I bought these because they are washable and the box said they are 100% cotton.  However, while prepping them for first use, they just about RUINED my very expensive Rowenta iron. Why, you ask? Why would the cotton setting NOT work on a cotton breast pad? Because the brainiacs who made them decided to use some sort of nylon-based serger thread on the edging! I started to iron the first one, and my iron began sticking to the pad. I peeled it off the iron, and there, in a perfect circle, were little melted remnant marks from the thread. It is not even polyester thread, which tolerates a VERY high heat (i.e., cotton) setting from an iron.I am so incredibly disappointed. I really wanted to use these because they are cotton. So, off to the drawing board, I will just have to sew my own. And in case you are wondering why I would iron them, they come out of the wash very wrinkly (whether you air dry or put in the dryer; I washed them twice for prepping and did both drying methods). One of my girlfriends said she had tried them and they were very noticeable under her shirt because of the wrinkling, thus, my plan was to iron them smooth after each wash.If you don't mind wrinkles, or are planning on using a padded nursing bra, then I suppose these would work for you... But if you are like me, and prefer no padding in your bra, then I would give these a pass.
+1	Ultimately, nothing works better than the disposables, but these are the best reuseables I've purchased. I do still leak through them from time to time so I only use them in the house. They are also great for comfort.
-1	You can see these through your bra...even a think padded bra.  And they don't lay flat so they aren't very comfortable.Try the  LLLI Washable Nursing Pads.  I have tried every washable brand and these are the best!
-1	very comfortable and stay put pretty well. however the slightest leak and they seem to soak through easily not recommended for those who leak a lot
-1	I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth. My nipples were raw, sore and a little bloody. Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples.  My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture.  To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts. Ouch! I found the smooth, cool lycra of my bras was better. A waste of money!
+1	They are very soft and much more comfortable than disposables. I just throw them in washer and dryer and they still keep the original shape. I don't leak that much, so it's not a problem at all.
-1	I have tried 4 other brands and these are the worst. I haven't had any problems with leakage (with this or any other brand) but after 3-4 washes the Medela pads are so wrinkled and have lost their shape that I can't wear them with anything without them showing through. I would not recommend these unless you were going to hand wash them - but who has time with a new babe! Especially, when the other brands are holding up just fine after the same number of washes.
+1	Within a couple of weeks of breastfeeding, my back was shot. This stool provided so much relief. It also helps my husband, who has a bad back and chronic pain, sit more comfortably.
+1	I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it...loved it! Ordered one for myself and cant do without. Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state! Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product...also...If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born..keeps me from being sore! You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold.I own the pump in style advanced... get this one, its worth every penny!
+1	This nursing stool drastically improved the usefulness of my old-fashioned rocking chair as a place to nurse my newborn. Prior to the stool my lap was slanted in a way that made it difficult to position baby and my back was leaned too far back to be useful. The stool converted my lap into a flat horizontal stretch that could support my baby and improved my posture so I didn't end my sessions with a backache. However, I also found it useful while nursing on the couch or other armchairs (same benefits) and my husband loves to use it when he is getting baby dressed after a bath as it helps him keep his lap horizontal as well. An added bonus is that it is incredibly easy to put together (5-10 minutes tops) and comes with it's own allen wrench tool.
+1	This stool is great! It is the perfect height for me to nurse my baby comfortably. I use it with a boppy pillow. The only problem is I get so spoiled at home, its hard to feed my son while we're out! My husband put it together easily in a few minutes. Slightly slante but I guess we can still use it later as a step stool. I also use it while pumping for comfort.
+1	Can't say enough good things about this stool. I used one at my lactation consultant's office and found it really helpful. It gets your body in the right position and makes nursing so much more comfortable. It's well made and easy to assemble. I am not too tall - 5'3" with legs on the shorter side. Maybe if you have longer legs you don't need a stool, but I would recommend it to any new mom planning to breast feed. In my experience, anything to make those first few weeks easier - while you and your baby are learning to breast feed - is worth it!
+1	This is a wonderful, wonderful product.  It is sturdy and easy to assemble.  I use it in tandem with my Boppy and love the results.  My two month old and I have had our trials and tribulations with breastfeeding, but this stool has eliminated all of our discomfort.  No more back pain and fewer bad latches due to awkward positioning.  If you are a breastfeeding mom, you need this stool!
+1	I didn't think a stool could really make it more comfortable to nurse, but I was wrong!  I used this with an old rocking chair and found that my legs were much more comfortable when propped up - especially during those long nights of rocking!  The stool is well-built and comes ready to use in the box.  The natural wood color is attractive and goes with nearly any decor (just so happens that my crib and baby armoire are also natural wood color).  I imagine this would be a great stool to use if you were nursing on a chair or couch that was stationary as well.
+1	I was nursing without this stool for almost 2 months.  I started developing lower back pain.  I thought it was from picking up and carrying around my son until someone purchased this stool for me.  In just 1 week, my lower back pain began to go away.  I would definately recommend getting this stool if you plan to nurse.
+1	this was a back saver for me while nursing. It was hard to nurse without support and something sturdy to put my feet on. This is well worth the money.
+1	The hospital that I gave birth in had this stool in all of its rooms.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon when searching for something to make nursing in our new rocker more comfortable - I am quite short, so I needed something for my feet to rest on.  I use this stool every night in the middle of the night while nursing and rocking our baby.
+1	I really like this stool. It's sturdy and well-build. Only complaint is that it could be a little wider for me. I like to keep my feet apart somewhat when I nurse.Amusingly, my toddler thinks this is his "chair" and uses it when we read books before bed time.
+1	We have a white crib and the last set of these I bought (years ago) were discolored. These are clear, and look and fit great on our crib. You should definitely measure the width and thickness of the area you want to protect though. I know some people did not, and wrote poor reviews about it when it was clearly buyer error. Our son figured out how to remove the other ones we had, but not these. So far, our nice crib is saved, hopefully for baby #2.
-1	I liked this product because it's a good rubbery material to chew on, but it only fit on the sides of our crib as the front bar is much wider. I had actually gotten these & put them on when my daughter was in the crib, but after being on a few months, they almost looked kind of liquidy underneath and when I went to remove them, they removed some of the wood varnish as well, so I left them on to look better. My daughter actually never did bite on the crib railings but my son does (3yrs later) and prefers chewing on the front bar best, of course. At least the side bars they fit on will not be used when it's converted to a full size bed, but there will still be those teeth marks on the bed footer. Oh well, it's kind of cute. I plan to use one of those wood color markers to cover the teeth marks if it really bothers me.
-1	I like the idea but in reality didn't work for us.  We would have had to order 3 sets to cover the 4 sides of his crib which gets pricey. The length (from top to bottom) is not enough for his crib either - his rails are more like 2 or 3 inches.  So he can get his bottom chompers underneath these and still go to town on the wood. And of course he pulls them off easily and throws them to the floor too (11 months).  I'm going to order some cloth ones that can be safely tied on-not interested in a DIY project when it comes to ties and cribs.
+1	Skip alllllllll the other gummy crib rail protectors and just get these. They go on with zero headache and stay on. Note, you will need 2 sets to cover both sets of rails. But these end up being cheaper and far more effective than the others, which, peel, curl and can even be bitten apart. Yes my little fellow managed that, even though it shouldn't have been possible. Thoroughly pleased and recommending to all my friends with teething babies.
-1	My 11-month-old can easily remove these protectors, making them worse than useless--they're actually an additional hazard. Buy something else instead.
-1	I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product.  I bought these crib rail protectors and my twin boys figured out how to remove them within a few days and they are under 9 months old.  So not only did I waste my money purchasing these, but both of my cribs also have a bunch of teeth marks... exactly what I was trying to avoid.  What a waste!
+1	I don't agree with the dimensions listed on Amazon's description.  It does come with 4 pieces that are about 12 inches long...which will cover one side of your crib.  However, I don't know what the 1.5 x 5 part is.  I measured the ones I have and the inside of the plastic measures about 3/4 of an inch...and the outside of it is around an inch.  The plastic is fairly flexible.  I have the Aspen 4-in-1 crib and it fits my rails just fine.  My 11 month olds have not pulled them off....yet ;)  There is another listing for this same product, http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Lionheart-Crib-Rail-Teether/dp/B001JBALRQ/ref=pd_sbs_ba_5 , you might be able to get an idea of the size/shape of the crib rail it expects.I covered just one side of their crib at first, but this seems to work and I just went out (to a local store) and bought another pair to cover the other side of the crib.I recommend this product, however, you need to measure or consider your crib rails - they need to be on the skinny side.Update:  After several months of use, I noticed that the varnish from my cribs has come off of the crib and stuck to the inside of the teething rails.  It is the very very top of the crib rail and not the entire crib rail.  I hardly noticed until I looked at it harder.  I still like what the product does, however, I'm disappointed that it has ruined the wood.  My cribs are cheap anyway, but still, I take good care of my stuff.  I don't know if someone put some furniture polish on the crib rail to make it do that (I didn't).  I thought this was important and wanted to make sure you know about.
+1	If you have all 2-prong plugs then this will work perfectly. If you have 3-prong plugs or plugs with adapters, be prepared to rearrange your electronics because they won't all fit in this product. I haven't found anything better though.
+1	Other users have lamented over the size of this product, but it really needs to be large in  order to fit the power strip and all the plugs.  It gives me peace of mind.
+1	This power cord protector seems to be working fine so far. My baby isn't one to pry her little fingers into the hole on top so that hasn't been an issue for us. It comes with outlet plugs, which were handy for the empty ones. I don't find the pieces that hook it together difficult to line up. Many people had commented they were difficult so I actually opened and closed it multiple times to test it out. No problem. It takes some minor concentration to line the pieces up. And it is actually white, not the yellow it appears to be in the photo.
+1	This does the job quite nicely, particularly for the price.  If a little one were really persistent, he/she could probably dig fingers through the opening, so I plug up the openings I don't have anything plugged into with the caps they include.  It isn't easy to unlatch, if you latch it well. My only complaint is that I have to unlatch it to plug something new in, but I can't fault the product-that is just how baby proofing goes sometimes.
+1	Holds a power strip and plugs okay, but my toddler can still get her fingers down in the cracks where the cords come out and the crack between the front piece of plastic and the longer back piece.  Mine is also a white color, not the cream like it appears in the picture.
-1	I wouldn't call this much of a safety product. The plastic is very flimsy and the locking tabs aren't that hard to open. I would expect a better quality product from something marketed as a "safety" item. It's fine as a deterrent, but nothing I would waste money on again.
+1	Daughter saw it once, wanted to play with it. She gave up shortly thereafter when she couldn't get in. Highly recommended.
+1	This is a must have for parents! What baby doesn't head straight for the power strip? It is easy to use, plesant on the eyes (it is white, not off white like the photo) and IMPOSSIBLE for babies to open!
-1	The opening on this is too narrow to accommodate iPhone/iPod/MacBook adapters.  If the cover were taller, it wouldn't be an issue because the whole adapter could fit inside, but it's not.  It's just too short, even for the smallest of the Apple adapters.  So I had to return this anyway, but if I'd kept it, I would only have wanted to use it for a power strip that I never need to add/remove plugs on -- the tabs to open the cover are a serious pain...and ironically would be easier to open if my hands were smaller.
+1	We have a very active 8 month old girl, so we decided to buy 3 of these to cover the connectors, Was very easy to put it on. Covers perfectly and makes the power strip safe. Would highly recommend this product
+1	This is a giant pain to apply and so hard to open--which makes it a great baby proofing product, but not very user friendly.  Make sure whatever you have plugged into the strip is going to stay there for a long time and isn't something that needs to be unplugged often.  The bottom portion opens easier than the top, also.
+1	I really like how this product hid the plugs and kept my son from unplugging/plugging the electronics.  It is very hard however for me to open it, but I guess that's the point.
-1	This is supposed to keep your kids safe.  My 18mth old figured out how to open this in a matter of days.
+1	These have worked very well for us.  We have power strips of a couple different sizes in our house, and this fits over all of them.  It is large enough to cover all the bulky plugs we have plugged into the strips as well.  I was surprised to read another reviewer found this too small.  I think the cover should work for most single-wide power strips; it probably wouldn't work for a powerstrip with two rows of outlets.  I found it relatively easy to open and close.  I don't think my baby daughter will be able to open them herself, and she won't be able to reach her fingers in and shock herself.  I now own at least five of these.
-1	This item is useless. It does not keep fingers out and it also doesn't fit larger plugs. I do not recommend it to anyone.
+1	I bought this white cover (model 40896, UPC 3676840896, code on label X0000DM4BB) andSafety 1st Power Strip Coverto compare the two.  Unlike that item, this cover is not expandable.  Its dimensions are fixed at 14" length, 2-3/4" wide, and 3-1/4" high (except for the 4" at the power strip cord end which is only 1-3/4" high).  The slot where the cords for the equipment come out is 1/2" wide and 7-5/8" long. When closed, the hole for the power strip cord is 1-1/8" by 1-1/2".  There are no holes for wall mounting, but four outlet covers, two plastic cable ties, and ten cord identifier stickers are provided.To open the 4" cover at the power strip cord end, you pull up on a single tab; this seems rather easy for a child to disengage, which means that he/she might have access to the outlet nearest the power strip cord end.  To open the main cover, you pry open three tabs, then open the unit like a clamshell.The plastic is softer but probably more resistant to breakage compared with the Safety 1st model.  I like the fact that you can simply open the 4" cover to flick the power strip switch on and off.  It is narrower and shorter than the Safety 1st model by about 3/4" in either direction, which may prevent using wider strips or transformers more than about 1-1/2" high with it.Buy this from Amazon.com!  (BTW, about the Amazon photo, the interior is actually white, I don't know what produced that egg-yolk-yellow color inside.)
+1	I think this is a great outlet strip cover.  I almost wish I had this before I had kids because it conceals it so nicely and makes the strip look much more tidy.  It's somewhat hard to snap and unsnap together. But that's the point, right?  I would recommend this to anyone looking to either conceal their outlet strips or babyproof their home.
-1	for where we needed this it didn't work do to the plug's we had in the outlets the cover wouldn't fit.
+1	This item works great for us! Again my 15 month old has lost interest in even trying to mess with it.
+1	It's not flimsy to me at all.  Maybe because the carpeting in our apartment stabalizes it, but it's perfect.  I also think it's very pretty - it brightened up the room.  I just love it.  Makes me want to further decorate the room for the baby.  Perfect height for me as well and plenty of storage room.  I do wish the pad furnished was a bit thicker and softer but it's sufficient.  I like how it's covered in smooth vinyl so we can clean it very easily.  Great table for a great price!
+1	I bought this changing table at a used baby store because I recieved the crib as a hand me down. Even being used this changing table is great. There are no problems. It's very sturdy and durable for the price. I have the shelves loaded up with alot of things and no problems at all. The shelves are made of a type of posterboard wood but they are sturdy. The pad that came with it is very thin and cheap so I purchased a better one. But this changing table is definitely worth the moderate price.
+1	I was going to get the "spindle" changing table from POttery Barn Kids but found this one, at about 1/3rd of the price. This one is even better b/c of the rail that goes around the actual changing area.. i do recommend a contoured changing pad with a comfy cover. i have attached a crib mobile to this table to keep katie happy during diaper time. this changing table looks good in her room, i also bought the Jenny Lind crib. i did get the baskets from PBK to store stuff neatly on the shelves. The only complaint that i have is that the shelves are basically hard cardboard, but dont let that discourage you b/c they really are sturdy and as i mentioned i've got baskets on the shelves so you really dont notice.
+1	I don't know what everyone else is doing with it, but I've had no problems with it falling apart.  It was not difficult to assemble but you did need two sets of hands. I store all our diaper-changing items on the top shelf in baskets, and then diaper bags go on the bottom shelf.  The only complaint I would have is that the changing pad is yellowing in strange spots (nothing to do with where it is used most).
+1	I was hesitant to register for these covers because of some of the negative reviews I read...However, my son is now 3 months old and we love the covers that we use!  Some common complaints I have read mention shrinking, poor fabric quality, and staining easily; our experience has been quite different:-Shrinking is minimal (I generally wash in hot water because I'm getting poopy out, too)-Any shrinking that does occur does not prevent the cover from fitting, only makes it more snug (which I like)-Stains come out very easily with Dreft stain remover or Shout (neither alters the cover coloring either)-Of my four covers, two have loose threads from excessive washing (still in great shape-I consider the fabric quality excellent, especially considering the amount of washings these go through in the first few weeks!)-One thing to consider: Colors online are very different than in person...I found that the pictures online show darker, richer colors.  I have 2 blue covers and one each of the yellow and white.  The blue and yellow are much, much lighter in person (they appear to be very pastel); I find them more appealing!Like I mentioned, I have four of these covers.  They are fantastic and I recommend them to everyone.  Buy more than one though, because they definitely get dirty quickly--I think I changed mine every day for the first 2-3 weeks that my son was home!
-1	This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it.  The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric.  The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel.  I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though.  Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad.  You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one.  I never used covers with DD and never had a problem.
+1	Do exact what they are intended to do. They've never ripped for us and they get warm quicker (breastmilk) than typical plastic bottles. It is easier cleanup using the drop-ins and thus worth the slight extra cost for us.
+1	I love these bottles and liners! They get rid of half my washing since I don't have to wash bottles. They're a lifesaver
+1	Haven't used these yet because I haven't had the baby but looking forward to it!!! I can buy them cheaper somewhere else but still good product it seems like!!
+1	You can remove all of the air from the liner so it minimizes ingestion of air. Initially we were hesitant/worried to use this system since we solely breastfeed for 5 months. The baby had no issues with the liner/bottle system. We use this in conjunction with our Medela Breast Pump. Works great, met all expectations.
+1	Love these liners have been using for many years with all my kids . never had a problem with them.
-1	I don't get the purpose of these since the air goes right back in during the feeding(got the special Playtex nipples and bottles). Also, the store brand ones do the same thing for half the price. Walmart ones are not as soft, but do the same thing still
+1	These drop-ins are okay - they are not an improvement over an ordinary bottle. Yes, I can simply throw these liners away after using them, but since I still have to wash the bottle's nipple, this system does not save me any time. I use these liners in conjunction with my bottle warmer and they don't melt, which is good. I bought the Playtex Drop-In system to try to reduce the amount (frequency and quantity) that my baby spits up. However, the amount of spit-up is the same - not better, but also not worse.
+1	I am a big proponent of the Playtex Bottle Liner Drop-ins.  Cleaning bottles becomes limited to cleaning nipples -- a far less difficult task.  They're easy and effective.
+1	We have twins so when purchasing products, it was all about investing money in things that would make our lives simpler.  These Drop-Ins work really well for the bottles. The bag collapses as they consume the contents, which supposedly improves problems with gas but I'm not sure this system accomplishes it better than any others. Because the bag is thin, it also takes a lot less time to warm bottles if that is a consideration. The real savings is the manpower and time necessary for cleaning. I only have 4 bottles per baby, replace the liner and nipple when necessary, and wash everything once a day.  These don't come cheap so I don't think there is any cost savings associated with this versus buying a boat load of bottles.
+1	Couldn't find this in stores around my area. But I've used this before and they're great. It's convenient and it minimizes the need for a lot of bottles and best part is they're disposables. I never had problems with this drop-in liners before although I did read another review that there's another liner that can be used with the drop-in nurser bottles, just as good if not more effective, cheaper and more count. Regardless, this has my stamp of approval and I would recommend this for new parents.
+1	I love these liners. They are a quick and easy way to ensure a sterile container for my milk. I have never had a problem with them leaking except for one time when I was squeezing the air out, squeezed a little too hard and POP!!, breastmilk everywhere. I learned my lesson- squeeze gently, if at all. My only complaints are: 1. They are a bit pricey for plastic bags but the convenience factor makes up for it, imho. 2. The amount markings on the bags are a bit hard to read and don't really line up with the markings on the nurser shells, so the only way I can tell how much my LO has taken is to pour out and measure the leftover milk. Otherwise, this is a great product!!
+1	Love this system and these drop-in liners work great! I would recommend these to anyone and I'm picky so you know they are good.
+1	Seems to help with my son's colic. Be sure to push the air out once the bottle is put together and formula/breast milk is it. Air will flow through the nipple. We used it until he was eating around 6oz a serving.
+1	These drop in liners are worth every penny.  With my twins, the daycare goes through lots of bottles each day.  These are so easy to &#34;load&#34; into the bottles and have never fallen out, burst, leaked, etc.
+1	When I am home, I use the Born Free bottles. When I travel, I use the playtex disposable bottles. Makes for easy packing and cleaning.
+1	Love them. I use these when I have to pump a bottle for travel. They are handy, easy to use and I love that you use them and then toss them right in the trash. Good price for the amount.
+1	Some people say that these drop-ins did not keep a good seal, but I found that those individuals were trying to push all the air out through the nipple and the pressure is what broke the seal.  If you want less air just press some of the air out before putting the ring on.  Pressing all the air out is unnecessary.  The liner does its job without pressing all the air out.  The point of the collapsible liner is to not let more air in as your baby eats, and it does a fantastic job.  If you would rather not buy replacement liners, Playtex VentAire takes the same nipples and does the same job with a vent at the bottom, keeping a seal when the pressure of the milk is on it, and then allowing air in through the bottom to replace the milk as the baby eats.  These don't leak as long as the bottom ring is screwed on properly.  I loved them because I didn't have to buy replacements and it did the same job!
+1	I love these bottles!  I breastfeed and my son takes these bottles so easily when I'm not around.  They are easy and convenient!  I'm not sure how they would do with mixing of formula, but it seems it may not be so easy because seeing exact measurements are rather difficult.I recommend these to everyone!  No problems with excess gas and you know you are getting a fresh, clean liner everytime!  Love love love them!
+1	I love these drop-ins. So easy to use! Much easier than traditional bottles. Also, they do seem to cut down on the gas.
+1	We used the playtex drop in bottles for our daughter and I do not have one bad thing to say about them.  They made my life a lot easier by cutting down on the washing of bottles.  You just drop in the liner and throw it away after feeding and the only thing you have to wash is the nipple.  No taking apart the bottle and washing several parts.... Just quick and easy.  We used the Madela bottles at first but she was having a few problems (too much air) but we did not have any issues with these.  We order all of our baby stuff on autoship (including the liners) and the price is unbeatable.
+1	We chose to use the Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins system because of convenience and sanitation. I'm so glad we did! We've been using the 4 ounce liners for 4.5 months now and we have never had one leak or break. They're very easy to use and reduce my time doing dishes. I've used the 8-10 ounce liners a few times as well with no issues. For those curious about measurements, it's very close to the measurement on the Medela bottles I pump into and Nuk bags. Sometimes after pouring milk into the liners they will expand just a tad more once the weight of the milk pushes the crinkles out, but it's not a large amount at all. I've used the 4 oz Up and Up Target brand liners as well, but when these are on sale at Babies R Us they are usually cheaper than buying the generic from Target.
+1	I don't have much time to go out shopping for things we need with a new baby. The playtex bottles are easy since there's no real cleaning everyday - the liners just pop in and out! The price here is just as good as walmart but it comes right to my door without the walmart craziness :) Would recommend for sure! No problems with leaking or anything...
+1	Baby is breastfed. These work well for childcare providers to transfer warmed milk into.Great price and easy to use. Shipped very fast!
-1	I measured 8 ounces in a measuring cup, then poured it in the liner, and it was a little below the 8 ounces mark on the liner. I tried it again with a different measuring cup and received the same result. You can not put the liner in the bottle first to fill it up, because the measurements on the bottle do not match up with the measurements on the liners, My husband always has a hard time filling up the liners because it is hard to hold it and add water since they expand. Also, the numbers on the liner are very hard to read.
+1	I love the playtex drop in system - it might cost a little more but it's worth it for the ease of bottle prep and knowing that bottles are clean and sanitary every time! These don't tear and warm easily in a cup of hot water.
+1	I go through these quickly, so I get a couple boxes at a time.  Worth the price; and that price is better than the price in the store.
+1	Very easy to use, combined with almost nothing to clean. The small cost of reusable liners is far overshadowed by their convenience.
+1	Playtex drop in suystem is what any decent lactation consultant will recommend.  it is by far the slowest slow out there.  kids don't get used to gulping down, and you have the best chance of continuing breast feeding.  the liners are easy to use.  means you can stay out all day with only 1 bottle.  great stuff.
+1	I use the Playtex nurser and tried two different generic brands (Walmart and Babies-R-Us) of the bottle liners. I was unhappy with both, and ended up coming back to these, even though they are a bit more expensive. I like that they collapse more easily than the generic, which seem more &#34;molded.&#34;
+1	When used with the slow flow nipple and the breast pump adapter kit this is the closest to breastfeeding as you can get.I bought the breast pump adapter kit and now i pump in these bags and never have to use a bottle holder at all.no more milk transfer from bottle to bottle, and no more air at all.  you can squeeze all the air out of these liners.take a look at the images to see step by step how i connect this to my pump kit and using the adapter rings and caps store, and feed without the need for the nurser bottle to mimic as close to mommy breastfeeding as possible.  For medical reasons my baby could not latch and this allowed me to bond with my daughter and have gas free feedings and be literally as close to breast as possible.  Check out the images - you will see for yourself this amazing way to nurse your baby.
-1	I have wasted so much milk using these drop-ins.  I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners, and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter.  Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk, and believe me, I've done that many times.  I've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole, I'll only waste a little bit.  But, come on, I'm sleep deprived, and stressed and sometimes I forget, and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter, and I shouldn't have to check like that for a product I've paid for.  No good.Out of a box of 100 liners, I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak.  That's quite a lot; we're not talking one or two here.  Unfortunately, I've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples, so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I cannot afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle.  I'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter.  I would NOT recommend.
+1	So easy to use and not as much clean-up afterward. Just pop liner in the bottle, add water and powdered formula, shake and you are good to go.
+1	I have been using these for 5 months, since my daughter was born and they are perfect. I have not had any problems with these and they are so much safer and sterile than a plastic bottle. Worth the extra cost to continue to buy these. I think the only thing that could come close to being as good is glass bottles.
+1	Used these throughout the bottle stage with our now 19-month old. Playtex bottles were the only ones we used and the drop in liners saved us time on dishes which to me was worth the extra expense.
+1	The Playtex dropins are a quick and easy way for bottles. The 100 count box is a good value as well.
+1	Love these bottles, but baby seems to drink faster with these nipples. Doesn't leak as long as you line up the arrows. Great for traveling with baby, but not that great for the environment.
+1	So far I really like. This product has not leaked and since my baby girl is growing this is perfect for water and formula.
+1	Most people look at the drop-ins bottles and frown because you have to continually buy liners for them. Let me tell you something, IT'S WORTH IT!! I love not having to wash the bottom part of my bottles.
+1	The yin and yang of disposable liners is having to keep buying more. But it beats washing bottles all day long.
+1	These liners are a great idea in theory. I only use them because my baby like the latex nipples and not many other bottle brands have latex nipples anymore. The measurements are a nightmare, I have to guess how much breastmilk I am pouring in the bottle. The only thing that helps is that I pour it in from a lansinoh storage bag and that gives me a better idea of how much I am putting in.With regards to leaks and the liner lip pulling free and falling out, I only experienced that with the 4oz liners but that was because I was overfilling them. However I am always worried about this happening so I screw the nipple on very carefully. It would be great if the nipple ring was clear so you could see if the liner is on the verge of pulling free or not.
+1	These work great for the playtex bottles.  I have had no issues of them leaking, as long as they are put on properly.  The number on the drop ins don't exactly match up with the numbers on the bottle.
+1	The Playtex system works well with my Medela breast pump - you will need to buy these liners, plus a set ofPlaytex Drop-Ins System Breast Milk Storage KitPlaytex storage rings (which these liners drop into). That kit comes with an adapter that fits on a Medela pump. The whole system is convenient and easy to move from frozen storage to feeding simply by dropping these liners into a bottle, and you can buy either latex or silicone tips for your bottles. The thin plastic allows the milk to heat up easily by submerging in warm water before feeding. Overall, very convenient and in almost 7 months of pumping, I never had a leak! Also, BPA free which is great!
+1	Works perfectly with the Playtex drop in bottles.  I love this system and wish I had used it with my first child. This saves so much more time with bottle cleaning.  Sure, you have a spend a little more to buy these liners but it's definitely worth it when I think of the time I save not having to wash bottles. (Can you tell I hate washing bottles?)
+1	It did exactly what I wanted. It lines the nursers perfectly. Liners are nice because all I have to wash are the bottle nipples!
+1	We were told about the playtex bottle by our lactation nurse.  She recommended it because we were having trouble breastfeeding and she said these bottles wouldn't cause too much nipple confusion.  They work great, we don't have to worry about washing the bottle every time.  Just put a liner in and you're ready to go.
+1	I don't know where I would be without these.  Easy to "drop-in" and you just throw it away.  I love that it's always ready to go and that I don't have to clean a bottle and a brush and make sure that everything is clean inside.  You can even heat up the milk/formula just by putting hot water in a bowl and swishing the bottle around for about 30 seconds!
-1	These are very small in size and "paper-towel-like", kinda feel like napkins that are made with recycled paper. We bought a pack and just couldn't use it because it is so small. I'd rather just use paper towel instead if I were to use these. For us we now use the babies R Us brand, they are much bigger and has a plastic feel to it, which is much more durable.
+1	This was the best purchase!!  These work great and have saved our changing pad from being stained!!!  They are just like the paper they put under your chin at the dentist office - and they work great!!!  We use each one a few times - unless it gets dirty on the first use - then just toss it.  Great to have in the diaper bag as well - don't feel so bad using the changers in the bathroom with these!!!
+1	Love these.  They are thin, but I like that as they are disposable, and I feel better about less waste.  I use them mostly out of the house, but occasionally use them preemptively for messy diapers at home, too.  They do rip easily, but you'll learn quickly how to handle them to avoid it.  Better priced than most, too.
+1	well, i purchased this at a local store despite erroneous reviews found here.  its a great device, at first it seemed wasteful since i could just microwave some water (3 minutes), then soak the bottle until it warmed up (3 more minutes) but now i can just pop in a bottle and the whole thing is done in under 3 minutes.  if youve got an extra $40 i recommend it.
+1	I was slightly spoiled, so why not pass some of that on?I got this because it was one of those things I thought I HAD to have, not true, but is sure is nice.  I lost the little green insert screen, but this thing works great, even without it.There are also instructions for deliming the warmer if you have hard water, like I do.  It's not too difficult and can be done in 5 minutes.
-1	First, we read the directions and we follwed them.  But this never seemed to work the same way twice.  Sometimes at 4 min. the formula was too hot and sometimes at 6 min. it wasn't hot enough.  There was no rhyme or reason to it, we had it set the same way every time.  We used it for a month and then threw in the towel.
+1	I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent. You may also want to purchase the Avent Sterilizer. It is fabulous.
+1	We've always used the microwave (most of the time) or a jug of hot water (when a mircowave wasn't available) to warm our first two children's bottles of formula - this worked fine for us as we knew the exact time to make the bottle just right.Unfortunately my third child had to spend some time in hospital when he was two weeks old.  What we learned from his nurses is that microwaves can 'zap' a lot of goodness out of your formula (the hosptial used a microwave as well until they were told this). We also learned that the prescription only formula he now has to have tastes digusting when not kept very warm.Hence our decision to purchase the Avent bottle warmer.  What we like about it is that it is easy to re-warm our bottles during a feed when the need arises and keeps all the goodness in the formula. The lack of an on/off switch is a bit annoying but we just turn it off at the plug.  The fact that the light goes on and off as it's keeping the water at a constant temperature is also a bit of a pain as at 2am in a dimly lit kitchen you can just assume you already turned off the plug when you haven't if the light is out.Despite these negatives things, they far outweigh the advantages for us of keeping our son's formula nice and warm.  It's easy to use, easy to keep clean and has worked pefectly from the day we bought it.We love it.
+1	The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is a very obliging unit. It services all types of containers, and of differing sizes too. It can warm disposable, oversized, and odd shaped bottles, glass babyfood jars, and tin cans to name a few. It's small in size, measuring 5" x 5" x 5 " high. Thus, it occupies very little room on the counter, or bedside table. A plastic basket fits on the inside of the warmer, and is removable for larger items. On the front of the unit is a dial control. It has 3 settings, 1,2, and 3, 1 being the coolest. Next to the dial is a power light, which serves 2 purposes.1.) It indicates the unit is "ON" and working, and2.) When the water reaches the correct temperature, the power light blinks "ON" and "OFF" to indicate the water is ready.There is NO ON/OFF switch on this bottle warmer. For that reason, one must unplug it after each use. With a rather lengthy cord, 3 feet long, it is very adaptable. For those concerned about d&eacute;cor, the all white exterior is designed to blend in. In addition, the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is portable. By that, I mean it's lightweight; it weighs 1 pound, and is compact enough to fit in an overnight bag. We traveled frequently when William was an infant, and this unit made a nifty travel companion.Pros* Accommodates all brands of bottles* Heats fast and evenly* Compact and lightweight* It's durable* Heats bottle liners without melting the plastic* The basket can be removed to warm oversized bottles, i.e. Avent Magic cup* Grounded 3-prong conductorCons* Overheats* No ON/OFF switch* An internal thermostat and an external timer would greatly improve this productMy Experience:Right off the bat, I was heating 10 bottles of breastmilk a day, as I was unable to breastfeed. Thus, I was thrilled to have a bottle warmer. Pop a bottle in the unit; plug it in, and in 5 minutes it's done. How difficult is that? The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer heats fast, evenly, and it's durable. Moreover, now there's no more white, icky, stuff to clean off my pans.In all the time I used this bottle warmer, I never encountered any problems. Let me tell you, this unit got a workout in my house. I think my success was actually due to reading the instruction manual. I know ~ "geek alert". Okay, that's true, but it's also fair to say that I quickly learned to keep a timer when warming. I overheated many bottles in the months I served warm milk, because I'd get distracted. Consequently, running a timer became apart of the routine. If Avent were to add an external timer, this would be extremely helpful to users. I almost never used the coolest setting, only when thawing frozen breastmilk, and I only used the 2nd setting when warming disposable bottles. Both were rare occasions. I generally thawed breastmilk in the refrigerator, and I used disposable bottles when I was on the go ~ outside the house.Here's another tip, adding an internal thermostat with an automatic shut off feature would seriously improve this product. Many have complained about the lack of an ON/OFF switch. I kept the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer on the kitchen counter so the lack of an ON/OFF switch was never an issue. Had I kept it at my bedside this would have been a huge inconvenience; although, a power strip would solve that problem. Whether one turns off a switch or unplugs the unit either way this final step must be completed. I can NOT tell you how many times I forgot to unplug this bottle warmer. An hour might go by before I realized my mistake. Now that's a fire hazard!Closing Remarks:When it comes to bottles, Avent is still my 1st choice. I have learned through research that several manufactures have modified their bottle warmers to accommodate the Avent brand. I guess that goes to show... input from customers can, and does influence manufactures. Avent could make a few improvements to this bottle warmer, which would certainly increase the price. However, I for one would be willing to pay for those added features. Would you? While writing this review, I've debated how to rate this product. I was extremely pleased with this warmer, but I also recognize its shortcomings. I've opted to give this product an above average mark, because1.) It did what it was supposed to do. It warms bottles fast, and evenly.2.) It accommodates plastic, glass, tin, and a myraid of bottles styles.3.) Warms disposable bottles, and bottle liners, and4.) It saved me from the stovetop hassles.Happy Feeding,Mary
-1	Before using to warm actual food or milk for my son I tested it out.  In the recommended time it was hot enough to leave blisters on my wrist when I tested it!
+1	I think the [...]. The fill line is crucial in getting the bottle warm. If you fill the water to high than it doesn't heat as well. The water is supposed to be just at the level of milk in order for it to heat correctly. If you fill it correctly it will work. It works fast too. A bottle of cold breast milk from the fridge is warm in about 4 minutes. If you're warming room temperature formula it will be even faster, probably about 2 minutes. I highly recommend this bottle warmer. My baby is not on solids so I can't say how it works on baby food.
-1	This thing is very hard to figure out. One setting gets the bottle too hot too fast, try another setting for 15 min's and you still have cold milk! I tried to use it for 3 months... finally gave up. Save the money. Warm water in the microwave and stick the bottle in that... Sometimes we need to listen to our mom's and grandma's - they didnt have these and we turned out fine!
+1	I like this a lot when I need to warm baby's bottles (I am not using Avent bottles but it works fine). It heats the milk evenly and to the same temperature as long as you follow the directions.But there should be a timer, or the light should turn off only when this is warm. The directions are way too complex for a mum and a crying baby. Be more simple!
+1	I was told that you can warm up water in the microwave or just put it in a bowl full of hot boiling water. But, in the middle of the night after weeks of bad sleep, the last thing you want to do is exactly that!! With the avent express bottle warmer is the easiest way to warm up your bottles with less trouble. The only thing that I dont like of this product is that doesnt have an on/off switch. Otherwise, its great!!! ( avent products are the best out there...)
+1	I got this product as a combo with the Avent Sterilizer.  ((Side note: the Sterilizer is a MUST HAVE item!!))It's nice to have a place to warm the bottle, and it does cut down on wasting water (vs the other method of a bowl of warm water).  The biggest plus is it's faster to prepare.  The problem that I had with the bowl of water method is that I would over heat the water then have to do a cool down process.  I thought this product would help with that but it doesn't.  You can get the water to almost boiling.  You have to time it, but again, it's fast and ready to go in 6-7 minutes.
-1	I used this for a short time. It was more of a pain for us.I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there. A timer would have been nice (and cheap enough to add).I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it.Yes, it may be the best there is out there, but that doesn't mean too much. It still has many flaws.Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on. There is so much they could have done with this that they didn't. Oh well.
+1	When I was pregnant with my first set of twins I felt that I could handle EVERYTHING. (i.e no exersaucer to babysit, not bouncers, no ridiculous toys, no uneeded baby products, and yeah, no sterelizer). Well my husband said we needed most of the stuff I said we didnt. But he let me be stuborn and didnt purchase the sterelizer. Well after 2 1/2 years of boiling bottles, pacifiers, teethers and all that other stuff, I was going crazy. Yet I still wouldnt admit it to my husband :). When the second set of twins were on the way, I was ready. I was going to buy baby wipes warmers, exersaucers, bouncers, swings, the aquarium crib soother and this sterelizer. Well this sterelizer is my hero (as well as my husband who forced me to get one!). It cleans about 6 bottles and all of the things that come with them. (actually it cleans 5 of the playtex airvent ones, but I use avent too). I did breast feed so it also cleans avent pumps (and my friend managed to get another kind in one!). My kids love pacifires so those are constantly in there, and so are all those teething rings. Let me just tell you that you can NOT put a dirty item in here, you still have to wash it a bit. This just makes sure its really clean, (my kids have maybe been sick 5-6 times, all four of them put together!) This sterelizer is great, and it uses very little water (I have a purifier so I use pure water). like another reviewer I HIGHLY RECOMEND TO UNPLUG IT WHEN NOT IN USE! I will say it again, after boiling bottles and sippy cups and pacifires and teethers all night, REGISTER FOR THIS! ITs a bit pricey but I can gaurentee that replacements for the bottles that you disintigrated while boiling and sleeping at the same time, and doctor visits and medicine for those odd illnesses due to unsanitary things that your child(ren) place in their mouth, will cost you more!*** P.S... IT MAKES A GREAT DRYING RACK TOO!
+1	We started off sterilizing using the old-fashioned, boiling water in a pot...what a mess and waste of time! Standing over the boiling pot and risking steam burns ran out of fun very quickly. After I got over the sticker shock for the sterilizer and got it home, I couldn't see how we survived before! It's quick, easy and efficient. New moms have enough to mess with, don't spend you few, precious moments each day waiting for a pot of water to boil, splurge on this item and you won't regret it!!
+1	This one is easy.  Put your stuff in, add a little water then push a button.  Truely a no brainer.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that you do have to drain it after each use.  My freind didn't and something started growing in it.  Other than that, this is perfect.  If you take out the racks you can fit a ton in it at once.  You don't have to watch over anything-go ahead and take care of your baby while this one does all the work for you.  Put this time saver on you registry.
+1	I love the Avent bottle sterilizer. I own two, one for my house and one for grandamas. You want to be sure your baby's bottles are sterile, but who has time to boil everything when you have a baby. It has never leaked! It is very easy to wash and fits well on the kitchen counter. It makes life much easier and gives you more time to spend with your baby.
+1	This has to have been one of my favourite purchases for baby - along with the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer. My husband and I had some controversy going initially on whether this was worth the money or not, and even HE now admits that it is worth it's weight in gold in terms of convenience, ease of use and overall good value for money. We keep a dish of soapy water in the sink and dump all bottles and binkys in there, rinse them off and load them into the sterilizer. Within minutes they are done and if you don't open them for a few hours they can stay in the unit until you're ready for them. I know that many people say you don't strictly need to sterilize everytime but with this you can run it as often as you want, it's a godsend for breastpump parts and according to our pediatrician, sterilizing is better for baby for the first weeks when they are so susceptible to germs. I would advise anyone thinking on this purchase to GO FOR IT. I can fit my entire breastpump and up to 5 bottles in as well as pacifiers in one go. This has made my life so easy! It also has a warranty just by the way, so those who have complained it packed up within a year, you could have had it replaced free of charge!
+1	This sterilizer is so easy to use.  It has three adjustable racks for bottles, nipples or other items.  You just put water in the bottom, your bottles (rinsed with warm, soapy water) in the racks, put on the lid and press the button to start it.  It is done sterilizing within ten minutes.  You have to clean it every so often by running it with citric acid (or vinegar) in there and since it has a coil heater, it should be unplugged when not it use.  Basically, it requires very little maintenance when the alternative is boiling bottles on the stove which takes longer and your bottles may easily be ruined.  The bottles are usually still a bit wet when the sterilization cycle is done, but you can leave them in there to dry, or place them on paper towels (putting a paper towel over the top of the bottles helps keep them sterile).  The sterilizer also comes with little plastic tongs to grab things and keep them sterile, but I just use my clean hands and my baby has not had a problem.  I sterilize Avent and Medela products in it and I have been very happy with the effectiveness and ease of this sterilizer.
+1	We have a dishwasher and had a full term very healthy child, and still used this product. Lids and nipples tend to turn up in the dishwasher and retain water, and sediment..so what is point if I have to just rewash them?This sterilizer holds 6 bottles, nipples, tops, and pacifiers all at the same time. You can put breast pump parts in it, and anything else that you need to sterilize. I washed everything, filled this with the items and water, and popped it in at 6 minutes in our microwave to have perfectly clean and sterilized bottles, pacifiers, or breast pump parts. I used this everyday until my son was 6 months old, when we stopped sterilizing bottles. Its easy, safe, convenient, and fast.
-1	I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!
+1	I bought this a few months ago and after reading a little about it, I thought that I wouldn't use it.  Boy, was I wrong.  I use it for all sorts of things.My niece dropped a sippy cup of juice in my car that wasn't discovered for a week.  I washed the cup.  When I removed the valve...NASTY.  I don't think it's ever been taken apart and washed.  After a second washing, I put all of the parts in this and let the microwave work it's magic.I love the lift out tray because whatever's in there that I'm sterilizing isn't sitting in the water.  It can also hold the Avent Isis breast pump.  The sterilizer is actually a great place to store your pump when it's just been cleaned and not in use.
+1	This product is a true time, not to mention life saver!  It completely cuts the time in half of boiling water.  If only it can hold more bottles.
+1	This is a great sterilizer. It is so easy to use, fast, and holds lots of stuff. Just check with your Dr., because some cities (like NYC) have water that is already sterile. Also, if you're breastfeeding, it's easy enough to boil water-- since you don't have to make as many bottles. Pricey.
+1	I ama clean freak and ws parnoid from day one about germs and my first child. I live in an area with hard water and boiling things was not reassuring because the water left deposits on our nonstick cookware. I would wash her bottles and things , pop them in here and in the time it took me to finish cleaning the kitchen or toss some clothes in the dryer this would be done. I could leave the bottles in there or take them out and prepare for use while sterilizing pacifiers and other items. I use the Avent system and love this!Now that she is about 7 months I only sterilize once a week but this s so simple I do not regret my choice. Being a nurse I worried about my daughter catching something....this was just reassuring.Great as a gift....
+1	It doesn't get any easier than this product.  Boy, am I glad that I got this at my shower.  I have never used anything more in my entire life than I have this guy.  It sterilizes my Avent breast pump as well.  As an aside, don't just rely on your dishwasher to sterilize your bottles and your breast pump.  For some reason, I never felt comfortable anyway just depending on it and put the bottles from the dishwasher into this sterilizer.  Well, I found out later that it was a great thing I was doing that because our dishwasher was not heating the water the way it was supposed to and nothing had been sterilized!  You can't always depend on one thing to do the job and since it's your baby's health involved here, take the extra step and make sure with this item.  I'm glad I did!  Plus, it's just so very easy to use.
+1	This works great. Wash your bottles and put them in this sterilizer. Put 7 oz of water and pop it in the microwave for 4 minutes and your done! If you follow the instruction you can only fit 4 bottles, but I have been able to fit 5.Not all babies need their bottles sterilize but if you want to be safe than sorry this is an awesome product!
+1	This makes it quick and easy to sterilize.  Four minutes in the microwave.  Fits four bottles in the center and nipples, etc. around the outside.  We use it daily.  Works best with distilled water- less residue- but tap water is fine too.
+1	This sterilizer is so easy to use even a dad like me can use it.  The tray holds all types of bottles, caps, etc.  Best of all, the bottles are clean and sterilized in four minutes, without boiling water or running a half-full dishwasher.I know, the price seems high, but this is one luxury that is truly a necessity.
+1	This is great for anyone with the Avent bottles.  A friend of mine got some of the bottles and the breast pump at her baby shower.  After a couple weeks of use she decided to get this sterilizer.  It's just much more convenient for her.  Takes much less time than the alternative!
+1	No more plugs to plug in or pots to boil. Just pop it in the microwave and walk away.  It fits all of her bottles and pacifiers in one process and it fits perfectly in my small kitchen when I am not using it. Definatly worth buying! you will get good use out of it.
+1	Portable and easy to use. Love the convience and ease of use. Only need Water and the microwave to kill the germs. Very convient and can do 6 bottles at a time or even baby spoons, forks & even bowls or cups your choice. If it fits inside with lid snapped shut then you can steralize it like me. Remember do not force it to close as that will run seal.
+1	I am NOT a clean freak who sterilizes everything my son touches.  I bought the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer to save time, and money.  After a brief, and horrible stint with stovetop sterilizing, I began to use the dishwasher to clean my son&#65533;s bottles.  Oh, and I mean USE.  Sometimes I ran the dishwasher 3-times a day JUST to clean bottles.  I live in the desert, where water is precious.  We pay handsomely for every drop that passes through our pipes.  When I saw this sterilizer sitting on the shelf at Target, I snagged it.1.) It requires a small amount of water, and2.) It sanitizes in less than 10-minutes.I thought to myself, &#65533;How can I go wrong?&#65533;This appliance is user friendly, so to speak.1.) There is NO way to confuse the stacking order: the base, the bottle rack, and the lid.  There is no other way to put the thing together.2.) Loading can be confusing if the instructions are not followed.  Keep the manual handy, as the loading order for large bottles, differs from the 4-ounce size.3.) Add the proper amount of water to the base every time.  Do not skimp on the water, as it could cause the unit to burn.  Do not over-fill it either, as the unit may not produce enough steam to work.That said ~ it&#65533;s really quite simple to use.  Pour 7-ounces of water in the base, load the rack, and pop it in the microwave.  In 4 or 5-minutes it&#65533;s done.  Of course, it depends on the wattage of your microwave.  Smaller microwaves may require more time, but that&#65533;s all there is to it.  I learned the hard way to wait before taking the sterilizer out of the microwave.  It&#65533;s HOT!  VERY hot!  Plus, any steam that&#65533;s emitted can burn.  The contents inside the unit will remain sterile for up to 3-hours given that the lid remains closed.  Once the cooling time has passed, 2-minutes or so, remove the lid carefully.  There will be lots of condensation on the bottles, similar to the dishwasher before the drying cycle begins.  Place all the bits and pieces on a drying rack, or hand-dry them.When my son was a newborn, I used the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer at least 4-times a day.  I cleaned bottles, nipples, breast pump parts, and pacifiers.  Later on, I used the sterilizer on some of his toys.  Be careful, not all toys are dishwasher safe.  If it&#65533;s top-drawer dishwasher safe, than it&#65533;s probably sterilizer safe.  We took many trips when William was an infant, and this unit made traveling easy.  It provided a safe place to store the breast pump, and it worked in every hotel microwave we encountered.  I don&#65533;t recall exactly when I stopped using the sterilizer.  It was probably soon after Will started solid foods.  At any rate, this sterilizer was seriously tested in our home.  I never had any problems, except the occasional burn to my hand when I opened the lid too early.  Bad mommy, bad!I can safely say the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer was worth its weight in gold.  Some might complain about the price of the sterilizer, but considering two, 9-ounce bottles come with the unit, it may seem more reasonable knowing they retail for $4.00 a piece. The EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer turned out to be one of the BEST purchases I made the year my son was born, and I will happily recommend it to anyone.Happy Feeding,Mary :)
+1	I got this sterilizer after the birth of my daughter and trying to wash all my avent bottles and nipples.  I don't know about everyone else, but I only run my dishwasher at most every other day, and I didn't have enough bottles to last that long when she was eating every couple of hours.  Plus, I find that in the dishwasher little bits of food and guck get stuck in them, especially the nipples.  The sterilizer works great, simply, and fast! You, obviously need to at least rinse the bottles and nipples before putting them in.  I washed all my bottles with soap before putting them in the sterilizer just in case.Also, now that my daughter has moved on to sippy cups, I use the sterilizer to clean those annoying spill proof valves that are impossible to get clean and aren't supposed to go in the dishwasher.I did use it occaisionally for my breast pump parts as well and it worked great for them, I just didn't get to breast feed for very long :(It saves time, energy and water! A great product!!
+1	I love this sterilizer.  It is very quick and completely uncomplicated.  In 5 minutes I can sterilize bottles.  The Avent bottles fit perfectly.  I now use the Dr. Brown's bottles and just have to lay them on their sides.  Obviously the sterilizer is using steam and is incredible hot when it first comes out of the microwave.  I ususally let it sit for about 3 minutes or so before removing the bottles.
+1	This product is so convenient.  I saw other mom's deal with the sterilization issue by boiling everything, what a time consuming process.  This way it's all done in less than ten minutes and you can be doing other things during the process.  The only suggestion I would make is to increse the number of bottles you could sterilize at one time.  Great product.
+1	This has been a lifesaver!!! It can sterilize 5 small bottles & nipples 5 minutes at a time!!! Just add the correct amount of water, pop it in the microwave, and go!!! It's saved me so much time and hassle... At first, I didn't think that I wanted to spend the money on a sterilizer when I thought I could boil them myself for free, but this has more than paid for itself in it's first 3 weeks of use... A definate must have for new moms!!!
+1	This is one product that delivers exactly what it promises.  It works quickly and well.I have used it daily to sterilize not only my isis breast pump... but also a hospital grade rented pump, too.  I am happy to say that neither of us has suffered from thrush or any infection.It's also wonderful for pacifiers and bottles.  I use the avent bottles which fit perfectly... but also have mendela bottles that fit wonderfully, too.I would highly recommend.
+1	We initially bought this sterilizer for use with our first child born in 2005. I loved it then, but I'm even more impressed with some updated details in the version we just bought for our second child. Before, putting on and removing the lid used to be a bit awkward. Now, easy-to-use latches have made doing both completely hassle-free. The inner steam tray also has more slots and spots that make arranging items easier. The older version was very similar but did not have specialized "compartments" to such an extent. All in all, it remains an extremely easy product to use because if I had to sit there sterilizing by boiling water and whatnot, it surely would not get done. That the sterilizer comes with bottles is pure bonus. I'd buy the steamer alone.
+1	This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  The best sterilizing option since I don't have enough dishes to bother using the dishwasher more than once every two days.  Even if you just want to clean one pacifier, it uses less water and energy than boiling on the stove and it's quicker too.  It saves my skin from hand washing in scorching hot water  (but I still give things a quick rince in warm soapy water before tossing them in the sterilizer).  It is a lifesaver when pumping and bottle feeding.The only drawback is the space that it takes up - it is about 12 inches in diameter and 6 inhes tall.  But I use mine so much, I just keep it in the microwave when I'm not using it!
+1	We use this for home and travel.  Just pop it in the  microwave and sterilize.  Good item.
+1	What more can you ask for? This is one of those baby products! It's VERY easy to use: so easy to use, you will learn to use it (believe me, this is important) &quot;in your sleep&quot;. It is inexpensive too: just shop around for other sterilizers and you will see this is the best one you can get for this price. Finally, and perhaps most important of all: this is an essential piece of baby gear. Sure, you can boil those bottles and those pacifiers, but let's face it: this is the 21st Century, and you might as well make use of your microwave.
+1	I LOVE this sterlizer! It is so convenient especially when you dont run the dishwasher every day!  The price is a little high, which is why i bought a used on on ebay. Best purchase i have made! I sterlize all my bottles in it, and pacifiers and even some toys.  However, when i bought it, it did not include instructions, i later got them off of avent.com when i got a horrible steam burn from the product.  That was probably just a dumb blonde moment on my part though! I was in a hurry and not paying attention and the steam hit my hand.  BE VERY CAREFUL! you will want to use and oven mit or towel to take out of microwave and keep your face and hands away when opening it.This sterlizer is great! i would reccomend it to everyone!  So far i have been able to fit everything from avent bottles to large 9 oz bottles in it, and even the parts to my gerber breast pump.  I look forward to using this for years to come!I found that the lid works really well for washing bottles too, instead of filling a sink full of water!  I can wash them in the soap and set them in the sink for rinsing, instead of using both sides of the sink.
+1	This is great!  I used to boil water to have my first child's bottles sterilized.  Then I got this for my 2nd and 3rd children.  I read the other reviews that it's much easier to just pop it in the dishwasher.  But what about for some of us who don't run their dishwashers daily(maybe because it's not a full load yet).  This sterilizer only takes 7 oz. of water and it takes 4 minutes in the microwave and your bottles, nipples, pacifiers, breast pump, etc. are sterilized.  You can't beat 7 ounces of water and 4 minutes of time.  You can't always wait for the dishwasher, which can take 30 minutes of more, plus all the water being used.  So for me, I think this sterilizer is great and it is very convenient.
+1	We wanted the microwave as opposed to the electric sterilizer because it was cheaper and more portable. It worked fast and great.
+1	Yet another great product from Avent!  This is so very easy to use and in minutes you have sterilized bottles, pacifiers, toys, pretty much anything that you can fit into the the thing.  We have a dishwasher, but our doctor advised that newborns can be sensitive to the soap the first few months.  Plus with animals in the house, we just like the idea of a little extra peace of mind.  By the way, we started with the electric sterilizer but after reading the directions and seeing it's size we returned it for this one.  This one is easier to store and use and is faster.
+1	This is a great product.  We use the Avent Bottles &amp; Avent Isis Breast Pump and they are made to fit into this sterilizer.  However, it works just as well on other stuff.  (You don't have to use their configurations to get good results.)  It's so much easier than boiling.  You just pop it in the microwave for 5 minutes and everything is sterilized.  We love it.
+1	This is one of my most used items from my registry.  Originally, I thought I would sterilize my bottles in the dishwasher but someone pointed out to me that that would require running the dishwasher every day.  Instead, you can throw your bottles, nipples and pacifiers in here as needed, and have them sterilized in 7 minutes.  It is absolutely something I would recommend.
+1	I have to pump milk for my daughter at my office, and getting my pump parts clean was challenging.  Our sink doesn't put out enough got water for me to feel that my parts were really clean and safe.  Now, I wash the parts and then put them through a steam sterilization in the office microwave, and I pump with the confidence that I'm not adding harmful bacteria to my breastmilk.  It also serves as a nice place to store my pump parts at the office, where I know they will remain clean and untouched.
+1	When we bought this, I thought of it as a luxury item, because you don't really need to sterilize that much, but we never use the dishwasher and I thought it would be easier and safer than boiling water.  Turns out that we were diagnosed with thrush and had to sterilize many times a day.  So glad to have had this!!! Some have complained about the "condensation" but this is really just the very fine mist of the boiled water on the items.  Shows it's working.. just rinse it off with water and put the items in the drying rack.
+1	I love this sterilizer. I am a breastfeeding mother and use the Avent Isis to pump milk from time to time. This sterilizer fits the Isis perfectly along with a few bottles, nipples and sealing discs. I wash my bottles out after I use them and put them away. When I'm ready to pump, I load this up and 7 minutes later I'm good to go. You don't need to dry the bottles or pump before using, if you use them right away. When I'm done, I wash my pump and store it back in here to dry. It stays there until I'm ready to use it again. I've never tried sterilizing any other bottles but the instructions specify how to place others in here so they fit well. It is very time saving, rinses easily, and works very well. I'm glad I've never had to resort to the boiled water on the stove.
+1	On more than one occassion I've had a crying hungry baby on my hands in teh middle of the night or the very early morning, and walked into the kitchen only to find that all of the bottles are in teh sink or in the dishwasher yet to be run.  It's much easier to keep my daughter distracted four the 4 or 5 minutes I need to wash and sterelize in this product than to wait for a load of dishes to run!  If this sounds like somthing that could happen to you . . . buy this product! (Or put it on your registry).
+1	I own Avent Natural bottles and this sterilizer was meant for the Classic line. All the holes and positions were specifically made for Classic bottles sizes.Of course it is still usable, though it will hold only 4 Natural bottles (or 6 Classic ones). I use it daily for sterilizing bottles and pacifiers, and it works perfectly.Just beware of the steam when opening it immediately after microwaving.
+1	We don't have a dishwasher so I throw everything in the sterilizer (bottles, breastpump parts, binkies, etc.)after washing with soap and water. It is easy to use, just throw items in, 7 ounces of water and microwave for 7 minutes. I use this sterilizer daily.I only gave it four stars because I put in the breast shield from my First Years breast pump and it melted a bit where the shield sat in the appropriate slot. I can still use the breast shield but there is a permanent dent melted into it. Otherwise, I love this sterilizer!
+1	Must have for sterilizing.  So easy, just 10 minutes or less of your time and your sterilizing is complete!  I use this sterilizer twice a day and it really makes the task quick and simple.  Well worth the price of admission!
+1	I saw this and just had to get it. It's good to wash and sterilize all bottles and breast pump parts before using them the first time.I own the Avent Isis breastpump and this has grooves for it to click into-very cool! I like to sterilize my pump once or twice a week, and once a week I sterilize the bottles and nipples.I can't ever wait for the washer to run, so instead of waiting, I just throw everything I want sterilized into the microwave for 4 minutes and it's done. It's so easy and simple.And it keeps things sterile for 3 hours unless you pop open the top right away!
+1	For weeks I boiled my ISIS pump parts and bottles, leaving on my non-stick pot calcium stain. As I was going back to work and my baby had to be bottle fed (thus more things to be sterilized), I found this great product and eagerly bought it. It's such a great invention! Everything (pump parts, nipples, dome caps, bottles etc) has slot of its own on the rack so they won't shift around. And if you keep the lid closed after sterilizing, contents stay sterilized for a day!Be sure to check your microwave power though, since it takes 4 minutes for a 1100watts microwave, longer for less powerful ones. Even though I have a 1350watts one, I do it for 4 minutes just to be sure!  And let it cool for recommended length of time to avoid scorching yourself.Enjoy this product and you won't regret.
+1	We love this sterilizer.  It is quick, easy to use, and fits other brands as well.  We wouldn't want to sterilize any other way!
+1	I use this at least twice a day to sterilize my avent pump and storage bottles. It is fast and easy and I can't imagine going back to boiling bottles again. A must have for working moms.
+1	I did not originally sign up for this item; it was given to me along with a box of 6 4-oz Avent bottles at my baby shower. I really like this product; according to the sterilizer's instructions regarding my microwave wattage, it only takes 2 minutes to sterilize and 2 minutes to cool down. I've never had any issues with getting burned or anything melting. And all it takes is 7 oz of water (I use filtered water instead of tap water) that I recycle every 2-3 uses to avoid wasting water(beyond that the water level decreases so it's best to measure to make sure it's still 7 oz).However, I have a gassy baby and wanted to see if I could switch to the Born Free bottles since several of my friends have raved about them. My 1 month old daughter is drinking 4 oz now, so I bought the 9 oz Born Free bottles and unfortunately they do not fit this sterilizer. She seems to be growing out of the stage of being fussy all night long due to gas so I guess I'll stick with the Avent brand bottles instead of buying a new sterilizer to accommodate using a different brand of bottles.
+1	solo viertes un poco de agua en este esterilizador, introduces los teteros y lo metes al microondas y listooo, ya estan excelente para darle la leche al bebe....
-1	The description states that this is compatible with all the Prince Lionheart Wipe warmers, but if you notice the pictures they have posted only show it with a generic wipes box or just holding the diapers.  This is because the wipe warmers are considerably larger and do not actually fit flush in them.  There are two small groves in the Prince Lionheart Wipe warmer that allows it to be forced onto it, but the wipe warmer hangs over the edge.The main reason I purchased this diaper depot to hang on the side was to hold the wipe warmer and diapers and save space on the changing table, but I don't think this one is going work.  The wipe warmer looks like it would just take a bump to send it tumbling and not very secure on the diaper depot.  If you are just using plain wipes without the warmer, it would probably be alright.  I primarily bought it to go along with the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer, so I'm left pretty disappointed.&#34;Compatible&#34; and actually fitting seems to be two different things....
+1	I was using a basket to hold wipes, lotions, etc and keeping on the changing table.  My daughter is growing and is very long so the basket was in the way.  I looked everywhere for a hanging basket but couldn't find one I liked for a decent price.  This diaper  depot is absolutely perfect.  It hangs perfectly on my changing table.  I did put a piece of fabric under it so the finish doesn't get scratched on the changing table.  I love having everything right there at changing/dressing time without taking up drawer space.
+1	I have recently started having a problem with my 12 month old kicking everything off of the end of his changing table while I am changing his diaper. His changing table is a dresser than came with a wooden surround that is removable once you are out of the diaper changing stage. This easily slid onto the rail and remedied the problem we had with him kicking the diaper changing supplies to the floor.I like that the little side compartments are removable. DIsposable diapers are so thin now that the slot you pull the diapers out through could be a bit thinner. I do often have two diapers come out instead of one. Even with that issue, this product is well worth the eleven bucks I paid for it.
+1	I have an Ikea changing station and this works great to help keep everything handy while changing the little guy.  It fits a Pampers wipe holder just fine.  There's not much more to say, if you're looking for something to organize the changing station and want a practical simple solution, this is a great product.
+1	For us, storage space is an issue. I was originally looking for a dresser top depot, I was unaware this was a hanging one. It actually worked out better this way! Tons of storage space for all the diaper changing essentials!
+1	I got this for my changing table and it looks great. i might get another one to put downstairs on the pack and play.
+1	I was worried this wouldn't work for us. We have a Pottery Barn Kids changing table that has a decorative moulding that sticks out about 3/4 inch beyond the frame of the changer top. This product hangs at a slight angle because of this, but it still hooks on solidly to the changer's top edge, and gives us much needed storage space for wipes up top. It is an inexpensive fix to a very annoying problem. Another bonus is that the plastic piece that the wipes container rests on is hinged to allow easy access below for loading diapers or whatever you choose to store in there.
+1	I am giving this five stars although it broke because my fianc&eacute; put a lot of pressure on it for it to break. Before it broke, I loved it. It held enough diapers for a two-three days and the side pockets held everything else that I needed for changing him. It WAS perfect, I am tempted to buy another one, that's how much I liked it.
+1	I bought this organizer since I will use the pack and play in our living room for changes. I have the Graco basic pack n play and it does not have an attachment for diapers and supplies. This fit perfectly and holds everything I need.
+1	i do like this product but i dont think it was worth 15 dollars. if it was under 10 bucks i may have given it 5 stars. it seems a bit cheaply made. however, it does hang on the side of my changing table nicely and keeps all the little items together. i have a regular wipe container sitting on the top and it fits well. the smaller sized diapers dont fit too well because they just slide around in the little compartment and often more than one diaper pops out when you just need one, but i suppose it was made this way so you can use larger diapers as your baby gets older.
+1	I bought this product to use on my Pack 'N Play.  It's definitely a nicer way to keep diapers and wipes organized at my Pack 'N Play changing table.  It fits onto the side of the Pack 'N Play nicely.  I wish the tub for the wipes box on top was deeper though.  The wipes box always tends to want to fall off when I'm taking a wipe out.  I also wish it held more diapers and that the diaper slot wasn't so wide, because when I pull out a diaper, about 2 or 3 want  to come out at once.  But all in all, this has been a nice item to have at my Pack 'N Play for diaper changing!
+1	I borrowed this item from a friend when I had my first child.  I loved it!  It stores a stack of diapers, a case of wipes, diaper cream, lotion, etc.- all within reach.  What I liked best was when friends and family came over to help out with the baby, they could clearly see where everything was to change baby's diaper.  Also, the plastic is clear, unlike a fabric diaper stacker, so you can clearly so how many diapers you have handy.Loved this item, will probably buy it for myself now that I'm pregnant once again!
+1	A friend made a changing tray for us that sits on the dresser and I wanted to be able to have wipes and diapers in reach without taking up dresser top. This was the perfect solution. Looks sturdy and I think it will really meet our needs! :)Here's a link to the changing tray:[...]
+1	This model is such a space saver for my small changing table. It's very strong and easy to hook on the sides of the table (make sure that the edge of your changing table is not too wide though and be aware when you want to put  any wipe warmer on the top tray. Most of them don't fit inside the tray. It just fits regular wipe boxes.  And the side containers also don't fit very large bottle of baby powder or lotion). I still highly recommend it though.
+1	This goes well with the new Prince Lionheart wipe warmer as well. A bit bulky but really useful.
+1	For our first child we did not have this awesome little gadget. Just bought it for baby number 2. It fits perfectly on the diaper changing station attached to our crib. No more bending in a hustle!
+1	An excellent replacement for those fabric organizers that hang off of the sides of things, this is plastic, rigid.  It's a little weird with newborn diapers as they can fall out of the bottom (the product is not exactly as pictured, the bottom is actually open on two sides, which is odd) but it really works well.
+1	I love this so much I've started including it in every baby shower gift that I give. I was skeptical at first, but it makes diaper changes so easy! Keeping everything in one spot is a must. We have one upstairs near the changing table and another downstairs near the pack and play. Wonderful idea!
+1	This is a great item to have on the side of your changing table.  I have both a diaper stacker and this.  The diaper stacker is great for a decorative accent and storage of tons of diapers.  The diaper depot is great for holding those diapers handy for the middle of the night changing.  Also, the wipes warmer fits right on top in the perfect reach.  The side compartment, they can come off, hold all the perfect necessities like Desitin and baby lotion.  I held Alcohol pads in them for the umbilical cord for the first two weeks.  This is really a handy little organizational item.  It is clear so it doesn't really stand out.  I have two.  One upstair in the nursery and one downstairs in the play room.  I highly recommend it.
-1	This diaper stacker is a joke.  The diapers come out 3 at a time, the shelf for the wipes container will buckle if you have a full container, and the plastic is very flimsy.  I brought this because of the great reviews this product got. After just one day of using this I decided to pack it up and return it.  I don't believe this product is ment to withstand the test of time.
+1	I have this on the side of our Jenny Lind dressing table.  I fit two rows of stacked newborn pampers swaddlers diapers in it (with the fold facing out), and they dispense just fine.  There is plenty of room to fit everything I need to use at the changing table in the side pockets... and I use the Dex Wipe Warmer with changing light in the area of the wipe holder.  It is a little bigger than the space alloted, but I find that the rubber non-skid bumps on the bottom of the warmer hold it within the wipes space... and since it is raised above the depot's wipes space it leaves room for any extra wipes that didn't fit inside the warmer.  This was a great buy, and I don't know what I would have done without it.  Everything is at a hands reach when I am changing my daugher (6 weeks old now) and I literally can hold her with one hand and reach everything with the other because of this.
+1	I received this as a gift and I'm going to buy it for every expectant mother I know.  We attached this right to the side of the changing table that came with our pack and play and it holds everything you could possibly need while changing your baby.  We hated the thought of having diapers and supplies just laying around downstairs, but were not about to run upstairs to the nursery every time we needed to change the baby.  This solved the problem...everything is right at our fingertips for diaper changes.  It also keeps our dog from going after diapers!
+1	This is the perfect addition to our changing table! It has just enough space for diapers, wipes, ointment, brushes, lotion, or anything you may need at your hand's reach while changing your baby.  Would definitely recommend!
+1	Very space saver and affordable! I stacked for newborn size diapers and size 1 diapers and it fits perfectly, even when I pull one diaper at a time, the other diapers don't slide through it. I can't believe how inexpensive this item is that comes with a great quality. It fits very sturdy at the side of Savannah Shore Changing/Dresser Table. Definitely recommend this item if you don't have enough space in your nursery!!!!
-1	Be aware this product does NOT fit all Prince Lionheart brand wipe warmer containers. I have the premium PL wipe warmer and it does NOT fit! If you plan to use it to hold normal plastic container of wipes, then you're fine.
+1	Perfect for organizing what you need on your changing table. It is not huge which was great for me because our nursery is not huge either. It held our wipe warmer (which was a little big on top but it staid in place), diapers, and the two side containers held creams, nail clippers, etc. It is strong plastic and hung perfectly on the side of our ikea changing table.
-1	I was so excited to get this because of the great reviews. After trying it out and on the changing table, I quickly realized that there was no way I was going to keep it. The first thing I noticed was that newborn diapers do not fit in the holder. It is made to hold full size bigger diapers. Then I realized that since I am left-handed, I wanted this to be on the left side of the changing table. Well that doesn't work, because the dispenser opening to get the diapers would then be in the back! So I tried it on the other side to see if that could work. In doing so, I realized that the plastic had left 2 scratch marks on the pretty cherry wood of my changing table!! The plastic is sharp and scratched my changing table on both sides as I was trying to figure out how to make it work. I considered using a cloth or something soft to protect the wood from the plastic, but quickly decided it's not worth it -- not only will it not work with newborn diapers, but it is also not left-handed friendly, and really does not give much storage space. Returning it right away. I would have given it 1 star but &#34;hate&#34; is too strong of a word. I simply do not like it :)
+1	We needed something to put on the side of our changing table for our wipe warmer and this really was our answer. Although our crib is curvy and not straight on the sides it still holds everything just right. A must have if you have the prince lionheart wipe warmer.
+1	We got this in conjunction with Prince Lionhart wipe warmer.  It is wonderful becasue it allows for the wipes, diapers, powder, and a rash ointment all to be stored at your fingertips.  It also works well to prevent damage to your changing table due to the warmer getting hot (which does happen).  As for the complaints about too little storage...we have a full sized powder, ointment, alcohol pads, a brush, clippers, and nail files in the side bins...which is more than enough stuff.The only complaint that we have is the diaper storage.  It is a weird size!  If it was just a little wider you could double stack little diapers.  As it is, you have to single stack them and there is a ton of wasted space on the sides.  They also pop out 3 at a time...great if you have triplets but a pain if you just have one.  It just needs a little bit or re-designing and it would be awesome!But, all in all it is a great little extra that provides well needed extra storage.
+1	For the price you can't beat this item. I bought and returned a couple of changing table hanging organizers. This one is what I settled on. It fits my badger basket changing table just fine. I was really looking for something small to keep wipes and ointments handy in. I like that I can also for my small prefolds (for cloth diapering) in where the diapers go. They don't fit perfect, but well enough that I'm happy! I paid less than $9 for this item so I really have no complaints. It serves its purpose!
+1	Very handy to have attached to the pack n play downstairs as our other diapering station.  It even fits over the plastic attachment for the bassinet height.
+1	I was looking for a diaper organizer/caddy for my changing station. I have an Ikea baby changing station and I needed an organizer that would hang from it, because I can't velcro something through it. That is exactly why I bought this diaper depot and I love it! Do pay attention to how wide your changing station's side is, it needs to be equal to or less than ~1.25 inches; otherwise, this diaper depot won't fit.I am able to fit some diapers in the middle compartment, place my wipes on top, and keep a few handy things in the side compartments. This allows me to use the entire space of the changing pad for my baby. Otherwise, I'd use some of the space to keep my wipes and diaper on the pad while I'm changing my baby. As she's growing, I need to be able to use the entire space for her and diaper depot helps me do just that. Love it.
+1	The Diper Depot works well with our Prince Lionheart whipe warmer. It's ridgid, plastic construction makes it a stable platform as compaired to the soft vinyl organizers. My only whish is that the hinges on the lid, of the diper dispenser, could be made a little sturdier.
-1	Cheap material, I returned it.It is not sturdyenough to use ever day.I was even afraid tobrake before returning the stuff.
+1	I love this diaper depot.  Prior to purchase, I thought it might be a little cheap, but it's the exact opposite.  It is well made with hard thick plastic.  It holds the diaper warmer on top and the side bins are great for nic-nacs like diaper cream, nail clippers, brush, etc.  It stores the diapers in the middle and has slots at the bottom where you can pull the diaper out from the left side or the middle of the depot.  It frees up so much space from the changing table and keeps everything organized and accessible.  We have a Graco Sarah changing table and it fits perfectly on the front.  This was one of the best baby items we bought along with the Prince Lionheart premium diaper warmer.
+1	I love this item. I bought this as well as other items for my granddaughters travel crib. There was no place to put her diapers, wipes, creams, etc. The diaper depot fits over the the side very nicely, keeps everything in reach.This will also fit a crib.
+1	We use the diaper depot for our Pack and Play playard. It's not a perfect fit, but it works, and it sure beats running around to get diapers, wipes, etc. I gave the diaper depot 5 stars despite two things:1) The opening for the diaper stacker is a little big, so sometimes an extra diaper slides out. In Prince Lionheart's defense, this may be necessary to accomodate larger sized diapers.2) The side containers could have been a little deeper.Besides these minor nuiances, it's a great product.
+1	Like many other reviewers, we used this on our Pack N Play as part of a secondary changing station.  It needed a little force fitting but worked okay.  The unit has helped us keep everything we need for changes organized and ready.  We've had no trouble with diapers falling out as some have reported.  Yes, the side compartments are on the small side, but they manage to hold a tub of vaseline, a container of Purell, a tube of baby lotion and a brush.
-1	This was cracked in the back when we got it so we sent it back and got our money back.
+1	There is one by this same company made specifically for dresser type changing tables. I have it and love it. It is almost a necessity. Holds wipe warmer, diapers, diaper creme, hair brush/comb, some q-tips, powder, small bottle of lotion...you get it. It holds the essentials, not everything you bought for baby. Both are great, but it depends on the type of changing table you have. Or if you choose to use the top of a dresser like I did, you'll love the "Dresser Depot".
+1	fits on my pack and play and just holds the junk you know,  dont think i could live without this item. and i use the diaper storage as back up when my dh uses last diaper and i and elbow deep in poop, this is a life saver
+1	This is very convenient. I have it connected to the side of our changing table, which makes it easy for me to have the essentials readily available when time for a diaper change. Great purchase.
+1	This fits perfectly over the side of our Babyletto crib and saves a lot of space. There's more than enough room for disposable diapers and they are very easy to take out and refill.
+1	It is just what I needed to organize my changer table.  Be aware that this product is not for a crib or a changer dresser or table top.  Also the edge of the changer table needs to be less than an inch for it to fit properly.
+1	Our changing table has curved ends, and it still fits nicely on the end! The top is the perfect size for a variety of diaper cases, and diapers fit nicely underneath. The little baskets on the side slide on and off, so you can choose whether or not to use them. It's made from a nice strong plastic, though it would break if dropped like most clear hard plastics, do. I highly recommend it if you need extra storage or shelf space!
+1	This net does what it says. I don't really like that you have to screw into the railing, but a child's safety is way more important. It was also a little wonky to size down the length. I wouldn't say it's too stylish either, but a person would be hard-pressed to find a stylish railing guard. At the end of the day, it does what it says and keeps the kid from falling though the railing.
+1	We bought a house that for all the other dumb stuff the sellers were asked to do after our inspection both personal and VA, they didn't have issue with the openings between the rails on the stairway. My older daughter could not just fit her head through but her whole body with no effort!  They are the typical late sixties rails and are metal. Before you scoff and say how you would just replace them with code wooden ones I implore you to look up the cost of a single family home in the DC Metro area of Potomac and you will likely gulp as you swallow your words!  So this netting is a much more viable and affordable option. Easy to install and very sturdy if you attach it properly. Once my girls are old enough I will get rid of the netting and gates and maybe even reclaim the living room as an adult room. Until then this item is a great purchase to keep children safe.
+1	it does the job, my daughter is discourage from playing with the railing since we installed this mesh&#8230;. not the best looking product but there is nothing else available in the market.
+1	we are in a rental home so needed to set something up that would not leave any marks or damage. Took me awhile to thread and tie everything, but was certainly worth it. Not the prettiest net, but it works and it isn't permanent!
+1	Nice quality, fits well, and easily tailored to fit my application with little effort.  Appear to be durable and safe!
+1	Let me start off by saying there is probably no way that I would install this inside my house.  It is definitely not the most stylish or fancy looking safety net.  But for the purpose of an outdoor guard it is perfect.  My condo is on the second floor and while I wasn't concerned about my daughter falling through I didn't want to worry about her throwing her toys onto the deck below.  I didn't use the hooks and string that came with it because it looked sloppy and was frankly a bit of a pain to install.  So I used simple tack nails to tack down the bottom trim to the side of the deck beam and along the top to the rail.  The nails are nice and small and won't leave any longterm damage.  If you are looking for something a little less 'attached' then the twine they supply would work.  All in all a nice cheap solution for a deck toy barrier!  Just make sure you get more than one if you have a long deck.... one wasn't enough for me and I need to get another one.
+1	This is a great bath tub and fits perfectly in my bath tub inspite of its hugh size. Its has a lot of space for the baby to grow in. The only thing I was surprised is that Toyrus is selling this for $26.99 as the regular price which is definitely cheaper than what amazon is offering at.
+1	We got the EuroBath when our daughter was six months old, and we love it!  It's true that you have your hands free for bathing, because the tub fully supports even the wiggliest baby.  Our daughter was able to spread out her legs and splash around, and she still loves it now that she's a toddler.  Although the tub is big, it's definitely worth a little hassle, because it makes bathtime fun for everyone.
+1	My son moved to this tub when he was about 5 months old and too big for his whale tub. I love that there's the option to let them recline or sit up straight. While my son is sitting up with no problems now and can catch himself (he's 7 months) I still recline him while I wash his hair so that I can avoid getting shampoo in his eyes. I have never used the drain feature as I just tip the tub over when I'm done. This is a great tub for babies too big for the sink but too small for the real tub! I highly recommend! I also recommend theOXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue- it really saves your knees while you bathe your child.
+1	Got for my daughter 10 years ago and continue to buy for friends.  So easy to put baby in and wash them hands free
+1	this is our 3rd (and surely, the last and the BEST) baby bath tub!  the first 2 tubs (Safety 1st and Summer) were nice but became too small for our baby when he was just 2.5 months old.  wish we knew about this tub before, we wouldn't have wasted money over the first 2 tubs.excellent points on Eurobath --1. huge space -- width, length and depth -- giving the baby enough space to splash and play (safely, without fear of him slipping into the water).  depth of tub allows for baby to be partially submerged in water keeping him warm throughout his bath.2.  holds baby safely in place allowing me to wash him using my 2 hands.  works great for first-time moms who fear and dread bathing a baby!3.  great anchors for the baby's arms.  these help mom clean baby's armpits, nape and back without any hassle, while keeping the baby in place, secure and comfortable.4.  drains fast.net, this is the best-ever tub we've laid hands on.  highly recommended for babies from birth to toddler.
+1	We gave our baby his first bath in this when he was only 5 days old, and we're still loving it now that he's almost 5 months. It's growing well with him and he always seems secure so that we don't worry about him slipping around. It is a large tub (almost as long and wide as our standard bath), so I don't recommend it if you are looking for something easy to store. However, if you have a dedicated child's bathroom where you can keep it, then this is a great baby bath tub.
-1	After reading all the reveiw on this, I believed I HAD to have this tub. It is bulky and a pain to use. Our daughter never liked it. Buy the sponge - it is a couple of bucks and really all you need, in my opinion.We just sold it in our garage sale - I think we probably used it about 3-4 times before we gave up because of the hassle.
+1	After I read all the reviews here on Amazon, I bought this bathtub right before the baby was born.  I had received 3 different baby tubs as gifts and returned them all and I'm glad I did. The baby is now 6 weeks and I can say that it is a well designed tub.Pros: Works great for newborn and the baby can continue to grow into it. The baby feels safe in the built in cradle for smaller babies.Cons: Only downside is it is super big.  I have to use it in our kitchen or the master bathroom where we have a large enough counter top.  Make sure you have enough counter space to place the tub on.  I would not put this in a regular size tub, can't imagine bending over like that is good for anyone's back or knees.Overall:  I highly recommend this tub.  Baby is happy and safe.
+1	We have 6 children & have fostered several. This tub was the best we have used! I have gotten rid of this tub twice thinking we were done just to have to buy a new one. We absolutely love this tub!
+1	This infant bath is huge! We decided we'll be hanging it in our bathroom out of the way, once the newborn phase is over.I think it will last throughout infancy and am glad we received it.
+1	This product has been wonderful for us as we only have a stand up shower at home.  For my little ones who are not old/big enough to shower, this tub allows them to take a bath with ample room.  Other baby tubs they would have out grown long ago, but this thing is really BIG.
+1	Agree with everything all the other (positive) reviewers have said. Used this for two kids. I felt like I could at least turn away from my baby long enough to fetch a washcloth or towel and know he would be safe.  Plus, once they get old enough it's great that they can splash in the water without having to fill your whole bathtub.  It is really huge, though.  If you have a small bathroom, anticipate having to store it IN your bathtub.
+1	Big, but great tub for newborn.  Kept my son, comfy, warm, secure and safe
+1	I originally bought a Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad based on all the good reviews.  I did not have any luck with it, was very hard to bathe baby alone so I searched again and came across this one.  It is exactly what I needed.  I am able to bathe my little one without any help.  She was probably about 8 lbs when we started using this tub and it cradles her so nicely so I don't have to hold her up or worry about her slipping under the water.  She is able to kick her feet and feels cradled and secure up by her arms.  This is really an awesome design.  It is a really big tub though.  We store it in her bedroom after it dries because there is no room in our bathroom for it.  That is the only downside, but it doesn't take away from the product at all so I didn't lower the rating.  Would highly recommend this tub.
-1	I really wanted to love this bath, but I don't.It is just too big even in my rather big bathroom.My baby wasn't really into this tub either.I'm still keeping it in case if we have another baby.If you are having a first baby, I would recommend using Infant Bath Seat from primo.It is easy to use, clean and store. My baby liked it better.
+1	Primo claims that the &#34;Eurobath is the only bath tub you'll ever need&#34;. It might just be true!When our LO was born, we started with one of the smaller standard bathtub with a net. It was ok while we used the net but quickly became uncomfortable for our LO. Now that we've tried it, we wish we'd have gotten the Eurobath right from the start.PROS:- Fits in our standard bath tub- Can be hanged (we use a Command hook)- Keeps baby comfy and safe for months on the &#34;baby&#34; side (at 7 months old, 18 lbs and over 28&#34;, our LO still uses the &#34;baby side&#34;)- There seems to be lots of space on the other side for when we're ready for it- Empties fast and easily- Actually saves water because it's so wide that there's no water loss when filling from the tub spout- No mold issues- Baby loves it!CONS:Haven't found any yet.
+1	We've been using this tub since our son was about 6 months old.  At first we used the infant position which worked great.  We got this when he was younger but since it doesn't have any padding we used instead a different tub until he was able to somewhat sit up (maybe he wouldn't have cared, but it looked painful).  After a year, he is still using it and fits perfectly in it. The tub went through a lot of banging, crayola drawing and stuff like that, but it looks great, and works like new.  The stopper has never leaked!
+1	Liked the fact that it can be easily used for newborns as they don't slip down and sink!It's very resistant and durable, the only thing I don't like is that you need plenty of space to storage it.
+1	This bath tub is everything we wanted in a tub for our baby. It has ones side where she can lie down and the other side where she can sit up. We started using this when she was 5 months; she could not yet sit by herself. She is now 8 months and sits very well on her own. She'll use the sitting up side for part of her bath, but still very much enjoys lying down on the other side. I was hesitant when I bought it, but now that we've had it for a few months, I would definitely buy it again.
+1	I brought this tub for my newborn. Great bath tub for babies because it provides the back support for babies. However as your baby get older, you may have to switch out of the bath tub since it doesn't provide much sitting space for older baby. Great bath tub still.
+1	We absolutely love the EuroBath!  We use it in conjunction with the Safer Bather bath pillow and our 6 month old just loves bath time!  The tub is incredibly well constructed, with a convenient drain at the bottom.  Whether your new baby is lounging on the one side, or your older baby is sitting on the other side, it is a safe, secure and comfortable way to bathe your child.Do not be frightened away from this fantastic tub because of its size.  It is longer than many tubs, but you can use it for a very long time and it stores conveniently right inside your bathroom tub or closet.I HIGHLY recommend this product!
+1	Our 4 month old son outgrew the First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub within a few months. He wanted to kick the water, but was kicking the plastic instead, which made him unhappy. I finally bought this bath. He tried it out yesterday and he was so happy! He fit in the tub very nicely. He could finally kick and splash in the water. In this bath he can splash the water with his hands too. He looked really crammed in the First Year's tub compared to this one. He stayed in the bath for 40 min splashing, laughing and cooing nonstop. No matter how much he moved, he stayed well secured.Great bath! Yes it is big, but that is the point!
+1	We had a Fisher-Price baby bathtub that someone gave us. It had a mesh sling in it to use when the baby couldn't be submerged yet. That aspect of it was nice, but when we started putting our son down in the water, he was moving all over the place and sliding down a lot. We used the F-P tub for about 4 months.I checked bathtub reviews inBaby Bargains: Secrets to Saving 20% to 50% on baby furniture, gear, clothes, toys, maternity wear and much, much more!(a great book to get to research baby gear) and found this bathtub. It is the best! It has guides for the baby's arms and legs and a crotch post to keep him/her from sliding down. Our son was comfy and in a reclined position. When he didn't want to be laying down for baths anymore, we switched him to the other side where he could comfortably sit up and play. We used this up until recently when we started putting our son straight in the big bathtub.For a long time, we used this on our bathroom counter. At some point, we started putting this tub inside our bathtub. He is 18 months now so we probably used it for about 14-15 months.Pros:-nice supports and guides to keep your wee babe from sliding all over the place-sunken areas for storing soap/shampoo-bigger area for older babies-recommended use for up to age 2-drainage holeCons:-BIG. This tub is huge-we had some issues with leaking from the drainage hole, but it was very little water so we just wiped it up when we were finished with a bath. It was about a tablespoon of water each time.
+1	My newborn squirmed and cried bloody murder during her sponge baths so you can imagine how nervous I was to immerse her in water for her first real bath. I needn't have worried. The shape of the infant side kept her comfortably cradled and even when she squirmed she stayed in place, allowing me to focus on getting her squeaky clean. (No need for two sets of hands). When she "fouled" the water, I used the drain to quickly empty the tub and then refill it before continuing with the bath. Since there is a toddler side I will be able to use this tub for quite some time before she transitions to the bathtub. Also the lack of slings or other cloth pieces eliminates concerns about the tub being fully clean and sanitary. My mother saw the tub and scoffed why would anyone buy a tub when they could just wash the baby in the sink. Then she saw how easy and effortless bath time was and she was sold. My newborn actually likes getting a bath now, hence I now enjoy bathing her. It's worth every penny.Things to know:1) The tub is big. It can't easily be tucked away somewhere out of sight.2) The shape of the tub requires maneuvering to get all of the water out while draining since all areas do not have direct access to the drain.
+1	We decided to go with this bath tub after reading lots of reviews about it...they were all positive!When we received it via courier, we were happy with the quality although found it a bit big.Our daughter is 5 weeks old and we've used it about 6 times or so.  Unfortunately we have to use it in the bath tub since it's so big which makes it difficult for us having to bend over all the time to wash her.  We don't have that much kitchen counter space so it won't work in that manner.All in all, our daughter enjoys it and seems quite secure in it.  She's not slipping around and she is well supported.PROS:-plastic seems durable, not flimsy-no foam/anti slip material in tub = less mildew, bacteria growth-has drain in tub-infant is well supportedCONS:-a little pricey-bigCompared to all the other tubs we saw, this one is a lot better in quality and function.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends!
+1	This is an excellent tub. I tried one of the seats first, which pinched my baby and was really uncomfortable. Second I tried another tub, I wish I could remember which one to warn you, but she just kept on slipping down to the bottom of that one despite its "no slip surface".Finally I tried the EuroBath. Never had a problem bathing my daughter in it. Its great for itty bitty babies, big babies, and even small toddlers. I used it all the way until my daughter was large enough to go into the tub herself.Only down side is that its huge. If you lack storage space, this can be annoying, but its definitely worth it.
+1	This is by far the best purchase we've made for our son - at 2 months old he was 16 lbs, and too big for most tubs.  This one is perfect.  He absolutely LOVES it - he kicks and splashes and has so much fun in the bath!  It's very supportive, but at the same time, he has a lot of freedom to play.  Our 7 month old nephew took a bath in it the other night, and he loved it as well.  He sat up where my son lies, and also had support and freedom at the same time.  It's too large for our kitchen cabinet, but it works well inside a bathtub.  I would absolutely recommend it to any and every parent and/or grandparent.  Just be ready with your video camera the first time you put your child in it!
+1	This tub is great for my 19 month old. We didn't really use it until she could sit on her own at about 6-7 months though. I didn't like it for before she could sit...another option with more padding is better. I will continue to use this until she's 2...it's great that I don't have to fill up the whole tub and feels much safer.
+1	We had a pretty big newborn (9lbs) so this worked really well for us.  I think I would be scared to put a baby littler than that in it though.  It is a HUGE tub.  If you don't plan on keeping it in the tub all the time...get a different tub.  I'm glad I have a basement because storing it anywhere else would be a pain.But the size is one of the reasons I love it too.  Son really likes kicking and splashing around in it and I feel he is very secure in there.  I love the little sections to put his shampoo and soap as well.  I love the little "out spout" it has too to empty it.
+1	Wow -- where do I begin? This tub is, hands down, the very best bathtub on the market. We bought this tub before our daughter (first child) was born. We chose it based on the rave reviews of a trusted friend and the advice of NICU nurses in a baby preparation class we took. After 22 months of use, this tub is still in perfect condition and our daughter still fits in it with room to spare. This tub allows you to wash your child with at least one, if not both, hands free. The baby sits in what reminds me of a western-style saddle with the piece in front that won't let baby slip down -- even as a newborn. Our daughter's very first bath was in this tub just the way it's pictured here (no infant insert needed). She'll be 22 months-old next week and still fits in this tub. We expect she'll fit in this tub well past her 2nd birthday. Now THAT'S what I call bang for your buck.We got one of those inflatable duck tubs for our daughter's first birthday as a gift. We blew it up tonight thinking maybe we'd start putting her in the adult tub with the duck since she splashes us a lot now and soaks the walls when we use the eurobath on the bathroom counter top. To our dismay, we found that the duck inflatable tub was way too small. We assume other inflatable tubs will be too per their dimensions. In addition, the duck tub was so narrow that our daughter's bath toys would have been piled up on her lap. In the eurobath, even at nearly two, she still has plenty of room to sit and play with all manner of bath toys. She sits confidently in the eurobath because she's supported so there's no slipping and scaring her, and there's no worry for us. I can wash her hair and her body without holding onto her or worrying she'll slide and bump her head, etc. We'll probably just start putting the eurobath in the adult tub for a while now until she outgrows it.I cannot say enough good about this tub. You WILL NOT find a better tub out there because it just doesn't exist. Other tubs may have "spa" features or temperature devices but they don't hold a candle to this tub. You can buy a cheap rubber duckie bath water thermometer at any baby store and they work fine. This is just the best design on the market and you will thank yourself time again, probably for two years or more, for buying this tub. We do, that's for certain.
+1	PROS:This tub is PERFECT for my 6 month old. It's nice and big, the water covers her whole body and she has room to splash and play with good support. She still uses the lying down position. We don't usually use the drain plug, it's light enough to just dump the water out.CON:For 0-3 months this tub had issues because it does not have the newborn sling.  (It looks like there are holes for one but there's nothing to buy from Primo).Our solution was to place a folded towel beneath her in the bath which did work great and provided her comfort and support while bathing.  You just have a soggy towel to wash after every bath which is taxing.
-1	This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable. His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic. Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby's balls so watch out especially if he's too small to fit in the tub properly! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old. Hopefully in the future we can use it again.
+1	After they outgrow the infant tub this is awesome. We had it for our first and got rid of it thinking we weren't having more. But we had another one and had to have this tub again. It will last well until he is 2 and works wonderfully.
+1	This bath tub is very functional & cost efficient..considering you can use this for a very long time (just DON'T use chemicals to clean it/ USE Organic Cleaners!) All you would need is a little pad to put under baby's butt or back..everything else it perfect! It is a little on the Big side...so if you have a small place, I would invest in something a little smaller...GO TO [...] they have this bath tub & another one that is a little smaller, so you can actually hide it under a cabinet & not keep it out in th open all the time because of how big it is :) Just nail it to the wall (back of door) like I did :)
+1	It is huge and can be slippery but if your child loves water and loves to splash around this is probably going to be the right tub for you.  Put a wash cloth down and, as always, watch them closely! I will say, however, that after ordering it off of Amazon, I found it for a cheaper price at Babies R' Us so check around.
+1	We didn't buy this seat until our daughter was 4 months old, because we were previously using the Puj tub. I only wish we had bought it sooner! I love the fact that it is non-toxic plastic, made in the USA, and can be used for many months. One side has a cradle seat for younger babies, and the other side has a round piece that keeps older babies who can sit up from slipping and falling. Right now our daughter is using the cradle piece, and loves that she can splash around. When she can sit up, we will put her on the other side. We will feel much safer putting her in this knowing that she won't be able to slip like she would in the regular bathtub. One of our best baby purchases!
+1	just make sure to use a thin bath towel under the baby to keep them from sliding so much, only issue I've had is that the piece for the leg split is too wide on the baby side, at four months my daughter still has a hard time having to sit there with her legs that wide apart...  it is just short of 4" wide on the baby side and not shaped for her legs to go over it either.
+1	This is a great product! The tub is well-designed and comfortably keeps my 5 month-old baby in place while I'm washing him.  Our son loves to kick and splash in it.We originally had the Fisher-Price Aquarium Tub, which was great for our newborn - 4 months.  After that, it became really uncomfortable for our son.
+1	My husband and I love this tub. So roomy and it's very clean/sleek looking! Our son was very cramped in his smaller tub at just 4 months of age! His toes would reach the end of the tub! My son is in the 90 percentile for his height & 60 percentile in weight.Now the reason why I gave it 4 stars: It is not ideal for newborns because it doesn't come with a hammock. From 0-4 months, the smaller tub was great for our son. It also allowed us to bathe our son standing up because the smaller tub fits on top of the kitchen sink. This tub does not. If you have a smaller baby, I don't recommend this for your newborn! In my opinion this is more ideal for babies who are 14lbs and up!
+1	Great bath!  Super useful and will be used for much longer than a typical baby bathtub.  It is very big, but much better than the others available in my opinion.  I like that there are two sides- one for a reclining baby and the other for a toddler sitting up.  This is better to use than sitting in the bottom of what can be a very dirty bathtub and  it saves me from having to wash the bathtub multiple times per week.
+1	This tub is the best- I wish I had bought it sooner. We had a 4 stage tub for our son, but he got really big and it didn't fit any more. I saw this tub listed in Baby Bargains (great book!) and decided to try it. I never used it for my son when he was an infant, but you can put the baby in one way and they recline, then face them the other way once they can sit up.This thing is fabulous! My son has a ton of room to splash around and play. In fact, now he hates to get out of the tub since has so much fun in there. The tub also has a spot to hold shampoo and bath wash bottles.
+1	I don't use the drain feature, so that doesn't bother me (other people have said it's hard to drain.) I love that it's roomy and has a couple different options for seating. I lay my kiddo down to bathe him but allow him to sit up to play. Actually, he can switch himself between the different seating options now (he's 8 months), which worries me a little, that he's that mobile in the tub, but hey, I'm right there watching, so I guess it doesn't matter much, and it entertains him to move around and chase toys around the tub.
+1	I needed a bathtub that would work for both my infant son and my 3.5 year old daughter.  My daughter freaks out in the bathtub, and I thought that getting a smaller tub would help her to feel more secure.  I also needed a new infant tub.  I really like the size of this tub, because it is huge (though it still fits easily into my standard size tub).  It has a nice contoured reclined position on one side to hold my infant son, yet the sitting position on the opposite side provides ample space for my 3.5 year old daughter.  This is the second time I have purchased a Primo brand product (the first time was a Primo potty), and I have been very pleased both times.  I think that the plastic could be a little bit thicker, but I think it is durable enough to withstand several years of use.
+1	I bought this when my 5 month old got too big for his small baby bathtub (he was 20lbs then).  He was a really big baby and his arm and legs were starting to hang out of the other one.  The baby seat my mom got me wouldn't stick to my bathtub floor and would tip over. So I'm so happy I found this.  It worked perfect. Exactly what I needed. Super easy and my son had so much fun taking a bath since he could play with a couple toys.  My son is 15 months old now and I have started putting him in the regular bath tub now and he does fine now that he has good balance and everything.  He is 30 pounds now and for him if he leaned over the side he would start tipping the whole bath.  But I think it's pretty sturdy, maybe just that my boy is a big for age.  Lifesaver for me when he was 6-12 months though! And it still looks brand new now, so I can use it again for next baby.
+1	We just recently stopped using it for our 18 mo old just because she can now sit in the regular tub but this little bath tub was great! Very durable and easy to clean.
+1	We started with what I call the newborn tub and switched to this by 3 months. We could have used this the whole time if we'd had it! It is very large and fits perfectly in our existing tub. We used it on our kitchen island counter-top until about 6 months when my son was really sitting up unassisted. Unless you have a sink right next to a large enough counter space you will have to bail the tub a bit unless you are really strong. One side is sloped for reclining. Makes hair washing a breeze if your older baby will stay reclined! My son no longer will! The opposite side is a little deeper for older babies. There is a drain plug built in that hasn't leaked on me yet! Just press it in when setting up the tub to be sure. The stopper on the drain plug tends to flop back down making draining the tub take a little longer. We just squish one of his squirt toys between the walls of the recline and side of the tub and tuck the stopper underneath.
+1	This is the best baby bath tub out there.  It is large, taking up a good amount of space, but when hung on the wall (there is a hole in the top rim of the tub for this very use) it's simple to take down and set up and then give baby a bath.  We've used it in two of the homes we've lived in, and it's worked great in both.  I used it on the kitchen counter in our small condo (as we didn't have much space anywhere else) and then I used it on the large bathroom counter in our townhouse.I tried that sponge shape for our first son in the regular bathtub and that really hurt my back (and he didn't like lying down in the water).  This keeps baby's head elevated even when he can't support it; but baby can sit up on his own later in the other end...  Win win!
+1	I have four kids and have used so many different tubs.  This is by far my favorite.  This tub is very big and holds an ample amount of water.  I love that it is molded inside to accomate young babies and later on toddlers.  While the baby is young, the infant molded side is great.  There is plenty of room to fill the tub and keep the baby covered in warm water.  There are even spots to hold soap, shampoo or wash cloths.  I like that and I always put my stuff in these areas before I even start the bath so that everything is right there and I don't have to reach for anything.  Once your baby can sit very well, you move him to the toddler/sitting side.  This side is great because it allows you to bathe the baby and he won't be sliding all around the tub because the moldings help keep him steady and secure. Here is the one warning and tip I will give:  My second son was very active during bath time.  He loved to play and carry on.  He kept on trying to stand and he kept slipping and smashing his little behind and nether regions on the molding.  This happened a few times until I learned that this tub was no longer a good tub for him.  I packed it away and brought it out when my third son was born.  I will use it until my son has the same problem.  I don't think it's a problem with the tub - just something that you should be aware of and watch out for.  Overall, I love this tub.
+1	We tried 3 different bath tubes for our newborn.Using this bath from her 4th week! perfect shape, highly recommended.
+1	You cannot go wrong with this bathtub!  It has an end for the infant and an end for the toddler!  Worked really well for us and we never had to buy two sizes of tubs!  Also, it is nice that it has ledges to hold your wash cloth or soap too!
+1	When I was pregnant and looking to buy a tub I went through every review on Amazon to see which one people liked most. The EuroBath got the best ratings by far. Now after using the tub for about 6 months I see why everyone is so pleased.I have never had to bathe a baby before so I was a little scared at first. This tub's contoured bottom made it so easy! There is a place designed specifically for your baby to rest comfortably without you having to hold them. Your baby may be a little small to fit snugly at first. If that is the case, use a towel underneath them to hold them in place.The only people that should maybe hesitate to buy this tub are those with very limited space. It is HUGE! My bathroom isn't exactly spa size so I store the baby tub inside my tub. There is also a way to hang it on the wall too but I'm not sure why you would need to go that far.I don't recommend trying to move the tub when it is filled with water due to it's size. I simply fill it in my bathtub, sit on the floor and bathe my son, then when I'm done I tip the tub up and let the water drain. There is tube that you can use to let the water drain from so you don't have to lift the tub, but I find it faster just to lift it up and dump the water out.Other than those with little storage space I see no reason why anyone shouldn't buy this tub. I think the reviews themselves show how much you and your baby will love it!
+1	Great bath tub and my toddler is 3 now and we are still using it.Yes, this is  a bit more expensive than some other models and brands, but you really get what you pay for.The fact that we are still using it after 3 years, that alone is worth the price.We have given this product along with a bottle of Argan oil (I love the brand Vitaville) to many of my girlfriends for baby shower.
+1	This was a life saver! Best bath tub for its side. Lightweight and enough room for my LO who is 8 months old to play.
-1	This was the ONLY bathtub I purchased, based on all of the stellar reviews, and BOY was I disappointed!! My baby was only 6 pounds full-term, and this tub was HUGE!! Even with the so-called supports the tub has, she still slid all over the place, and I still had to lean over the side of the tub and hold her very carefully! She hated it and so did I, and to this day (18 months later!) she HATES the tub and we're still doing sink-side sponge baths!! If I had to do it again, I'd get one of the smaller tubs that has the sling-type support! IF YOUR BABY IS A PREEMIE OR IS JUST ON THE SMALLER SIDE, DO NOT BUY THIS TUB - IT IS JUST WAY TOO HUGE AND REALLY HAS NO SUPPORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE MUNCHKIN DUCKY TUB FOR $15, AND I WAS ABLE TO GET HER TO CLIMB INTO THE TUB AND EVEN START PLAYING WITHIN THE FIRST 5-10 MINUTES OF HER LAYING EYES ON IT!! It's considerably smaller, has walls that go straight up (versus being slanted, like the Primo) all the way around, and I think it just makes her feel so much more secure and safe!! Should've gone with this from the beginning.....
+1	After our twins got too big for baths in the sink but still too small to just sit in a tub, we were at a loss.  All of tubs we saw were meant for one kid and we were hoping to be able to give them baths at the same time.  I finally saw the EuroBath and decided to try it out.  It worked fantastically!  One baby had to recline while the other partially sat up, but we could finally give them baths at the same time.  We've been using it for several months now with no problems whatsoever.  Our kids love it and so do we!
+1	I was surprised at just how large this tub was when I received it. Literally, my 3 year old can take a bath in it. He LOVES it, and calls it his "boat". It is really sturdy. it has both positions for infant and toddler, so really can last a long time. If you are NOT looking for something large, this is not the tub for you :-)If you have a smaller infant (which I always do), I would think adding a sponge insert will help to allow even the smallest baby to fit.We love it!
+1	Ok, this is the tub you need, folks.  We started using it as soon as my son's cord stump fell off.  Alex *hated* sponge baths, but he loves his Primo tub.  The reclining position is pretty darn safe, and it gives the baby a lot of support while you wash, which is a Godsend.  Alex kicks his feet into the water, but I don't have to worry because he is held up by the raised center bumper and doesn't slip too far into the water.  The depth is perfect, too - the baby doesn't get too chilled.I agree with some of the other reviewers that the drain is very small for the product size, but really, it's not hard to just upend the tub and dump out the bath water once the baby's out.  I also like the indentions to hold the soap and bath products because keeping those in close reach is very handy.  The only real negative is the size of the Primo - it gets unwieldy when we have to take it out of the tub when company comes over, but otherwise we just leave it in the tub.I look forward to using this for many years!
+1	This bathtub is excellent because you can use it from birth to toddlerhood.  I started using this for my son's first bath and it was great.  I just put a towel underneath him and he was safe and secure.  Now he's over 20 months, and we still use it, and he's still very comfortable in it.  Sure, we could probably just use the bathtub, but this will use much less water and I feel he's much safer in it.  If he accidentally slips backwards, the sloping backrest catches him without injury.It's nice and big - for me, this is a plus as I think he'll continue to fit comfortably in it for at least another year.  However, if you have a really tiny bathroom that is shared with multiple people, this could be a drawback.How many baby products do you use, basically every day, for the first 3 years of baby's life?!  Not many.  Considering this fact, it's $25 well spent.Also, it might be nice for some to know: if the stopper/gasket breaks, the company will send you a replacement free of charge.  Given this fact, the bathtub could last for generations!  ;)
+1	We call this tub "Moby Dick" in our house on account of it's size, but this has been a great tub for my now 16 mo old. He really cannot slip in this tub and has ample room to play and splash. I use the baby side to shampoo his hair.All in all, a great tub!
+1	Although rather large & cumbersome in my apartment, my newborn daughter was perfectly comfortable and secure in it.  My favorite feature was being able to use both hands to wash her or lather soap in my hands since the tub supported her so well. This is the ONLY tub I would recommend!
+1	I looked really hard for a tub that can grow with a baby.  The headrest of the tub is great for a newborn and I love that I can wash the entire tub and not worry about detaching and washing the support fabric that other baby tubs have.  The only thing I don't like about the tub is the size.  It's huge.  Takes up 3/4 of the size in our bathtub.
+1	We love this tub and so does our daughter! I read the reviews on this and we are so glad we recieved this as a gift. The tub has been great since she was a newborn, and weighed in at 7 lbs. 11 oz. She fits great in the contoured area and the water level is sufficient to keep her warm and happy during bathtime. We originally bought one of the sponge teddy bear pads to put her on inside the tub, but found it unecessary and uncomfortable for her because she was now out of the water too much. Instead to make the plastic where she lays a little comfier we put in a hand towel to lay on. We are extremely happy with this tub and would have rated it five stars, except for the fact that it is HUGE. It is very hard to find anywhere to store this monstrous tub after the bath when it is damp. That said, the fact that it is so big allows two parents to enjoy giving the bath together to the little one, and allows for the deepness of the water a tradeoff you'll have to decide on.
+1	We are very happy with the tub.  It is light, well made, made in the USA!  THANK YOU!!!  We buy a fair share of Made in China stuff, so it is nice to see a made in the USA product.  THe drain in the bottom is a great idea as well.
+1	Everyone is right, this is a great tub for your little one.  My baby is 5 months old and was outgrowing the infant bathtub that sat on the sink.  He fits great into the infant side and he had a blast the first time he was in the tub.  It was the first time he could splash around and the first time Dad heard him laugh!  So worth it.  He doesn't find it so amusing anymore but it's great for me because I can give him a bath alone now instead of having to have another person hold him up in the tub.  Yes, the drain is really slow so I do what someone else does and use a large plastic cup to scoop the water out so I can refill with clean water.  But, no big deal since we use the cup to rinse his hair anyway.
+1	At first I thought this tub was ridiculously big, but my son loves it! I think it's so clever that you can have the baby in a lying down or sitting up position, depending on which way you put him in--this product is very durable and made to last until your child outgrows it! We even bought a second one for our summer house, because I can't imagine giving him a bath without it. My son is 9 1/2 months old and can sit up perfectly, but still prefers to "lounge" in it lying down. I put it on my kitchen island and bath him that way, so I don't kill my back in the bathroom. I also like that it's all plastic, no mesh or rubber mats that can mildew--it has a bump in the middle to keep the baby from sliding.
+1	Our 6 month old outgrew her 4 stage bath tub & I wasn't comfortable readjusting it to fit a toddler.  This Eurobath is wonderful.  It is VERY roomy & baby enjoys splashing around. There is plenty of room for her toys.  It has a drain & I haven't had any problems with it.  It seems like it would have been perfect to bathe an infant too (since it has the special design to do so), but I didn't have it at the time.  I definitely recommend this tub!
+1	This is the best for me. It is very simple to use, even when you are a first mum and are giving baby his first bath, and convenient according to baby's age.
+1	After dealing with a couple of unsatisfactory baby tubs, I found this tub for my infant twins. It is, hands down, among the best baby gear purchases I've ever made. Can't say enough good things about this product. The smart ergonomic design keeps your baby sturdy and safe, and allows you to have both hands free for washing and grabbing bath products and towels. YOU WILL LOVE THIS TUB!
+1	This tub is great to use for infants, but definitely not for newborns (unless you provide extra support, which defeats the purpose of this tub with a built-in support).Also, very big in size, so take it under consideration when purchasing.
+1	Our son loves this bath tub! He is so relaxed in it! Best out there on the market!
+1	I used to have one of these small baby tubs with a hammock for newborn.the Hammock thing was great when she was a newborn but as soon as I stopped using it and put her straight into the baby tub she would just slipped, flipped and I always need to hold her which made it very hard to clean her....this tub just solved all of these issues.she is hold into place and can freely splash and move without me holding her and in exchange I have my 2 hands free to clean her.PROS:the design is such that:Baby can lie down and splash and play while being hold well.Baby can sit and play while being hold well.This is a two stage tub-it looks big but fits well in my bathtub which is very standard.CONS:Nothing yet.UPDATE:Baby is now 10 months and she still fits in the tub (and she is very tall- size of an 18 month old baby)- I will keep using it as long as I can as it way better than dealing with the regular bathtub. I like it so much that when we go on vacation I always try to find a baby equipment company renting that kind of tub.
+1	Before my son was born I bought him fisher price bath tub. I liked to look at it, and imagined how I would bathe my baby in it. So the time came, and Nick was born 9 lb 4 oz. Huge?! Oh yeah - he was too big for his tub. And bathing him was such a disaster :( especially when he started to jump out of it. I couldn't bathe him alone, my first hand was busy with holding him and the other one was shampooing. And my husband was showering. We tried to switch to an adult tub, but as he can't sit yet it was even more uncomfortable: my back ached, the baby was scared, and I was nervous.When my son turned 4 months, he weighed about 20 lb I couldn't wait anymore, and again searched net for bath tubs. All I saw was about same size as fisher price. Finally after googling "my baby doesn't fit his bath tub", I found an advice from woman who recommended trying primo eurobath, date of her advice was 2001, but anyway I tried to amazon it and found it to my great surprise. After looking at customer photos I understood this is exactly what I need.So it came, I cleaned it and we tried it same evening: Nick was so happy. He was sitting like a king on his throne in it. Primo is designed so well, like it was created just for the shape of my baby. It has space for his hands, bump doesn't let him to jump out, it's pretty high, and it also holds well.Our bathing time became much longer. The baby was very happy, smiling all the time, and kicking the water. Mommy was relaxed for the first time, and really had fun :)))
+1	Our daughter loves to take a bath in this tub, and we love to bathe her in our Eurobath.  The contoured tub holds her head above water without our assistance, and it has since she was a tiny little thing - under 7 pounds when her cord fell off.  We are looking forward to being able to turn her around when she can sit up on her own!  Hate to bathe her without it - though we have had to a few times.
-1	My husband registered for, and we recieved this bath when our daughter was born. From day one, I absolutely hated it. My daughter was born 7lbs 15oz and 20" long - She constantly was sliding around in this thing, or when she would kick and splash her legs would go around the "post" that was supposed to separate her legs and it would hit her privates hard. She just could not relax enough to enjoy her bath, and she LOVES to be in warm water.Even with a sponge support she cried every second she was in the water. A towel, sponge support, anything at all that might help A) make her not slip around so much and B)make it not so hard. Once we switched to a softer material tub by Summer Infant (I might also add that the tub is MUCH smaller!) my daughter loves bath time again. She will kick and splash, play with toys, etc.I would not recommend this bath tub. It's a good idea, but the material is just too dang hard and it's not comfortable for little babies.
+1	I got this for my baby shower and I LOVE-Love-Love it.  I put it on my kitchen table after filling under sink, and drain it from the easy-drain spout right into the sink when I am done.  My baby Amelia has been in it since week 1 and she is 3 months and still loves it.  She fits perfectly in the newborn side, and I feel safe she won't slip down.  I can easily bathe her alone without problems.  Highly recommended, especially since the tub grows with you and your baby.
+1	This is an awesome tub. It's huge so Lo can stay in for a lot longer than most tubs. My daughter loves her bath time and her tub. The seat thing is great and does a good job at keeping her from slipping when I lay her back.
+1	As a soon-to-be new mom I was determined [read obsessed] with finding the most practical of items for our new arrival. I read the reviews of the Euro bath and added it to my registry. I am so glad I did! From the moment we brought our son home this bath has severed us well. I must confess that I also recieved the summer infant comfy bath sponge and actually the two items complemented each other perfectly. From newborn to about 10 weeks I placed the summer infant bath sponge in the reclining part of the Euro bath. This secures a small baby in the bath, keeps them warm and allows you to reach for things like washcloths and wash without fear of them slipping. Given the low cost of the bath sponge it was a winning combination. As our son has got bigger we've not needed the sponge and at 13 weeks he's now at ease in the reclining part without the sponge. I have been told that some babies don't like water (my little man did wig out once) but I think the Euro bath is a gentle intro to water and bathing. The plug hasn't been very useful for us as I tip all the water into the tub to drain before cleaning with plant based cleaner but it may be useful for some. Overall this has been one of the best registry gifts that will last beyond the first few months.
+1	We love love love ours. We have used for two years, and it is in as perfect condition as when we bought it. No sharp edges a fabulous size, and easy to clean. It is also more attractive than many others we looked at. Could not be happier.
+1	This tub is HUGE!!!  You need to measure because you will need to figure out where you will use it and store it.  My master bath only has a shower stall, so I use this in there when I bathe my 6 1/2 month old daughter. My shower has an extra long shower hose, so it is very convenient to fill the tub.  While there is a plug it doesn't really do a good jub of letting out the water while the baby is still in the tub.  I let it drain as best as it can and when she is done with her bath, I just turn the tub over and let the water out.  I store it in the shower stall when I am not using it.  I would have bought the white tub, but Amazon had it priced at $15.00 more than the blue tub, plus the blue tub was eligible for free shipping with my Amazon Prime account while the white tub was not.I had this same tub in white when my son was a baby.  He is now 4-years old and prefers to take showers.  He is a big kid and outgrew the baby bath tubs so very quickly.  It seemed like every couple of months we were buying new baby tubs and then I found this tub.  He used this tub until he was nearly three years old.  I preferred using this tub because for some reason, it seemed like it kept the water warmer than the big bath tub in our main bathroom.  Also, there is nowhere for him to hit his head, which he did on the regular bath tub.  This tub, does hold quite a bit of water, but it even if you fill it completely full, it will only use a fraction of the hot water that the main bath tub in your house will use, so it helps you save on water and water heater costs as well.My daughter is 25&#34; tall and just under 16 lbs and just outgrew the Puj tub that I was using in the bathroom sink.  Instead of buying a smaller baby bath tub, I opted to just buy this tub because I knew from personal experience that it would be the be all end all baby bath tub for me.  Little Miss likes to kick, so this tub is perfect for her.  The infant supports hold her very well.  I do not need to hold herThe infant supports
+1	This is a quality bathtub. When we first received it my daughter was about 10 lbs and 21in and the tub was a little too big for her...I ended up putting a folded towel in the bottom to prevent her from slipping. Now my daughter is 6 months old, 14lbs and about 24in she's just about right to use the tub without the towel.
+1	Design is superior - no other tub compares. You can use this from birth on, no matter size of baby. First daughter was tiny, second was a tank. Both love their eurobath. It is huge (the bigger your bathroom - and tub - the better), but so worth it.
+1	I was determined to not by a giant plastic baby tub because I lived in a 3 story townhome. Well, I finally gave in and guess what, I purchased what I think is the largest tub they sell. This thing is big. It is one molded piece of plastic -- no removal pieces to have mold grow under.I used a large sponge to bathe my child in the sink until she was about 3-4 months old and got so squirmy I was afraid she would wriggle out of my hands and bang her head against the sink. I did a LOT of research on the best tub before buying this one. For a few weeks, we had to pad the set with a towel so it wasn't so hard and so that my child fit better. But she loved this tub so much more than the sink -- she learned how to splash so much that she now soaks all four walls and the ceiling.She's 10 months now and still using this tub -- she'll fit in it for a long time. It's nice that we can still use this one on the counter and not have to lean over a regular tub. My child has a cousin born at the same time -- his mom had a different tub and ending up buying the Eurotub a few weeks after we did because her child almost flipped their smaller tub.I purchased this from Babies R Us -- it was significantly cheaper than the Amazon price at the time.
+1	The tubs works great for my 6 month son, but I could not make it work when he was a newborn... He was just too small for the tub.And yes... its almost as big as a regular sized bath tub, but that's one of the things I like about it... more fun for my son.Taking off a star because of the plug... it doesn't stay open on its own... it keeps closing, which is annoying when you are trying to drain the water while your little one is in it.
+1	Biggest baby bath ever! My son loves this bath! I love how it keeps him sitting up, and it will last him a few years.
+1	I used the safer bather (and liked it) one time before going to the EuroBath. I used the safer bather in the EuroBath when my sons was very small, and within a month or two just used the EuroBath. I love this tub. The main reasons:1. Uses alot less water than the bath tub2. Has a position for all age babies and toddlers, which will save money because you don't have to keep buying bath products and again it save with the water bill (My son still used the lay down position)3. Has spots to hold things while I am re-adjusting my son4. Has easy drain plug5. plastic so you can dry it quickly and put up elsewhere if other members of the family use the tub.6. White color so you can remove things floating around in the bath water, and you can easily notice things such as bug bites and such that need your attention on babies skin. (i am a paranoid mother! :))7. Once you get your hands on it you will see that it is built to last. There are no plastic cheap parts to break or wear out. It is one solid thick mold. That means a whole lot to me.The only bad thing about this tub is that it is large. I like large because I know I will get my 25.00 out of it since I will be able to use it for several years but again it is a pretty large item.
+1	So - We had one of the fancy schmancy Puj baths because of space concerns. The baby hated it.The baby loves this bath! He kicks and splashes and has a grand time. We place it next to the sink on the kitchen counter and it works wonderfully! My mommy group of over 80 women agree! This can be used for toddlers too as there is a sitting spot opposite of where the baby lays.We don't store it in the bathroom - it has a hole for a hook and we just hook it onto the back of the nursery closet door. (A tiny closet - but it fits!)This would be super useful for those without a bathtub and just a shower!
+1	I bought this and had it sent to my niece for her baby shower, so I can't really say much about it as I never actually saw it, but she told me she really likes it!!
+1	We still use this tub for my daughter at 2 1/2, 30 lbs and 37" tall, and have used it since birth.It is so RARE for a "convertible" baby-to-toddler product to actually pan out in real life that I just had to review this.The molded shape of this tub is just perfect, and thinks of everything!  The slanted part is such that we still use it to wash my daughter's hair even as a large toddler.  It seems to be very comfortable between the crotch as she's never complained, and sits relaxed reclined or upright. As a baby, she was cradled, secure and very happy.I love everything about this tub, especially its' large size.  Some reviewers complain about this, but I look at it this way:  we have a tub/shower, and put this bath tub into our bathtub to bathe our daughter.  If I had to scrub out our tub every night to get it clean enough for her, that would be a huge pain!  Given this tub's large size, I can (now that she's too big to ever slip under) fill it up to the top, and she's got warm water and suds up to her mid-chest, without any risk of her falling under as with an adult tub.  To me, this is a much more pleasant bath than sitting in the adult tub as a toddler in only a few inches of water.  If you put more water into an adult tub, we've found our toddler slips around too much and feels insecure, even with a mat.Cleaning this tub is a snap.  No nooks and crannies for gunk to accumulate.  The rubber drain is the only place where we get some mildew, but it pops right out for easy cleaning and reinserts just as easily.  I use a Seventh Generation cleaner with a hydrogen peroxide active ingredient.Durability is fabulous:  We actually never drain the tub with the drain, but lift it and spill the water out.  Even with a full tub, in 2.5 years we've never had a crack.I love this tub so much, we bought two more - one for Grandma and Grandad's in each state!  For $25, this is a slam dunk in all respects.
+1	...or so my older friends tell me.  We were given a Diaper Genie for a shower gift and it proved so invaluable in the baby's nursery upstairs, we bought a second one for our downstairs changing table.  (we had been wrapping each diaper in a plastic bag and throwing them in the garbage - yuck!)Keep the instructions until you get the hang of loading your Genie - the Genie comes loaded with the first roll of plastic, and we had some trouble figuring out how to load the next roll because we didn't have the practice from the first roll and had misplaced the instructions.  It is easy to load but not so easy to figure out how it loads if you aren't paying attention or are sleep-deprived.
+1	It works great!  No icky smells and very easy to empty.  I put a dryer sheet in the bottom of it like a regular garbage can.  It just makes it smell nice.Just read the instructions first, it saves you from frustration later!  ;c)
+1	For us this is a LIFE SAVER!!... It has been really helpfull... I even bought another one for my mother's house... Im agree with a lot of nice stuff from other reviews and Im not going to repeat them, but I have to say something about how many times it gets full.  It's not true that it gets full everyday.... or.... It would get full if you put the diapers open.... What you have to do is Fold the diaper together with the wipes that you use, and you would see the difference... I use to change it every 2 days, now It gets full every 4 days.... The refills are not expensive at all, and you could always get free refills at Babies R Us, buying 2 or 3 together....I use one refill every 3 weeks or so....I haven't try any other one in the market, but for me this is perfect, so I could say that is the BEST OPTION!!!
-1	Be wary of any diaper pail that requires instructions and a demo by your next-door-neighbor in order to use it!  After I figured it all out I found that it was a pain to fool with.  Also the refills are expensive and it doesn't hold enough diapers IMO. It doesn't lock out odors either.  It may have for the first week or two, but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD.  I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier.  What can I say?The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly.  No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper, the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked.  The only positive thing I can say is that when you do cut the links loose they are easy to dispose of in the outside garbage.You may want to save your money on this one and go with something less fru-fru.
+1	This product is worthwhile, because you are going to be changing diapers constantly, and you need to throw them away in some sort of sanitary and convenient manner. When baby starts eating solids, there is quite a different aroma coming from his diapers! This device is basically a garbage can, but it helps keep the nursery from getting stinky. The only thing is, because it holds so many diapers, it can make the nursery smell very "baby powder-y". So keep the room well ventilated. The Diaper Genie is easy to use, and the refills last a long time. If you happen to live in a building, with a garbage shoot on your floor, then you don't need this. Just put a day's worth of diapers in a plastic bag, and down the shoot.
-1	I would rather throw the diapers on our kitchen trash can. It's a lot faster and easier than trying to mess with the Genie. I would recommend trying a different brand.
+1	Oh the diapers are not really a stinky issue if your baby is young and you breastfeed him or her. But just you wait until you introduce those solids. Phew!!! I suggest you get one of these right off the bat and go straight to using the green liners for toddler diapers. They are thicker and hold the stench at bay way better than the wimpy blue liners. Just remember to empty that sucker out every other day or even the Diaper Genie will abandon you to the Smell Genie.
-1	I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months.  Then I discovered what a waste of money it was.  Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench.  I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie. infant, original and toddler.  Still didn't do the trick.  I even put air fresheners in and near it....  Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers.  Still a hassle to remove the "diaper weenie" so now I just use a normal trash can.  Much less hassle and same results.
+1	I love this product!! It makes a huge difference in how the changing room smells. I have seen negative reviews on this product, but I would guess that they haven't mastered how to use it. It is a little tricky. It would be nice if it held a few more diapers, and the cutting and changing of the refills is a little tricky, but I love it just the same. The sausage idea is great because it contains the smell when you open it to put another diaper in there. My 5 mo old laughs everytime she sees her father change it. He loves to go on about the poo-poo sausages that she is so talented at making...lol (Daddies are weird) When you get one make sure you read the directions twice
-1	The Diaper Genie does the job of keeping odors away, but otherwise it is a real pain!  If you shove the diaper down and accidentally miss the clips you have to reach down and pull up the messy diaper and wipes!  Ick.  Particularly icky at 2 am.And contrary to what one poster says, a monkey definitely couldn't operate this thing.  The refill directions are lousy.  It took us over a half hour to figure out how to install the refill, and we're all college-educated professionals (and my dad, a retired mechanical engineer, couldn't even figure it out!).  It's hard to get the refill in, even when you do figure out the part that's ommitted from the instructions.  When you're busy with a newborn, the last thing you have the time or energy to deal with is a challenge like this!And why does the obvious dial at the top cut the liner instead of sealing off the liner for the next use?  Yes, you realize that's what it does after reading the directions.  But we have to tell anyone helping care for the baby not to turn the noticeable dial because it doesn't do what you think it will.If you do decide to purchase this product, don't turn the liner multiple times after use as the directions suggest.  The only reason they say to do this is so you'll run out of the liner faster and have to buy their refills.  One or two turns is sufficient once you get the diaper lined up in the Genie properly.I wish I had taken a better look at competing products.  I realize now there's a real reason other companies decided to come up with other models.  The Diaper Genie has some major flaws.
-1	It is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn (1-3 months) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day. The inside gets  horrible smell like something died in it. It is very hard to replace the refill. Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills. So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie. And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing. So right now it is in the garbage. Money down the drain.
+1	The Diaper Genie is sooo easy to use and they always have coupons on refills.  I love it.. Even my husband can use it lolol... u just pop a diaper in til u feel the grabber thingys and then close it and twist the lid and it locks in the diaper... I can keep it next to the changing table and know my son can't get into it and won't smell his nasty poopies..
-1	We ended up giving this away. The stickers it comes with is a joke. We went with another brand (just one long piece) and it worked out much better since our brick fireplace is rounded. If you do go with this one, make sure to get the removable caulk as the stickers don't work AT ALL.
+1	A new baby reaching toddler size presents a lot of difficulties around the house. What will he get into? How will he injure himself? What do we need to do to protect him? Hmmmmmm. It's a tough question and no matter what you do, he'll probably find something you didn't think of. Our toddler has already found a tube of diaper rash creme and spread it all over himself (primarily the face) and over the wood floor and a carpet.Well, we've tried to do some common sense things. For example, our living room has a large fireplace with a raised brick hearth. The edge, and particularly the corners, are sharp and harsh and could cause a good wound if the baby were to fall against them. So we bought this Prince Lionheart Cushiony Fireplace Guard. I installed it in about an hour. It's a one-size-fits-all solution and I was afraid our fireplace was too big. No problem. It took a bit of cutting, but we ended up with about 6 inches of edge left over.We don't like the looks of it, but the baby's safety is of greater importance. The guard is stuck on with some tape from 3M and there are warnings in 10 different languages that they do not guarantee that the glue will do no damage. Hmmmmm. I expect there will be damage when the guard is removed. It's an imperfect solution, but better than nothing.Gary Peterson
+1	Just as described. Works well, good quality.  Needs replacing when child is teething and I will replace with same product.
+1	Easy to put on. Only put tape at TOP and not SIDES if it isn't a perfect 90 angle. Our fireplace is made out of stone pieces so it is uneven on sides. It still stays with tape only on top holding it on. Colors are true to actual look.
+1	Haven't had any issues with sticking. My 13-month old has tried pulling at it, but haven't succeeded. Not sure if it's due to getting the product on right or his lack of interest and attention to it. Or both.
-1	We got these becasue our new house has a brick fireplace with an elevated ledge.  Our daughter was just learning to walk when we moved in and as part of our baby-proofing we decided we needed something for the fireplace.  This was about the only option BRU had and it was a waste of money.  It didn't fit together right and then the adhesive didn't stick to the brick.  Plus when it was on our daughter seemed to be drawn to it! It never failed she wanted to go right to it and try to get it up.  So we just took it up and she's been fine without anything on it.  In fact, she's pretty much left it alone since we took this off.
+1	Worked very well for when my son began walking at around 12 months and would fall into everything.  I purchased the colour that best matched our fireplace mantel
+1	I have 2 of these covers and love them.  i put them in the wash at least 2x a week, and after 5 months they haven't even faded (i have a blue and a cream colored one)I throw them in the dryer regularly as well and have no problem fitting them back onto the changing pad - which is an issue with most covers.  I have no time to wait for these to airdry, so that was a must.Overall i'm very pleased.
-1	I have two of these changing pad covers and used them both for a year with my first child. They are mediocre. I noticed that the material frayed around the elastic after a few months of use. I stitched them back up, but it looks kind of cruddy and the material continues to unravel in new places. I agree with one of the other comments regarding a slit for the safety strap...one is not present. Finally, I used it with the changing pad by "Especially for Baby" and the fit was a bit too tight which resulted in the pad curving a bit over time.For a few more dollars, I would strongly recommend looking at Pottery Barn Kids' chamois pad covers. They are extrememly soft (you'll wish your sheets were made out of this stuff!), have the safety strap slits and fit the changing pad perfectly.
-1	I can't believe how much this shrunk once it was washed!  It never made it to the changing table.  You would think the makers of this would know that every item that is going to touch a baby is going to be washed.  Therefore, have the material be pre-shrunk before marketing it.
+1	We have two of these that we rotate and they work just fine for us. We also have the contoured changing pad by Simmons. True, they do seem a little small straight out of the dryer (the cover stretches straight across the top of the pad), but after one changing our baby's weight shapes it right into place. That's really never bothered me. And considering how often they are washed, they are really holding up well.My only complaint (and why I didn't give it five stars) is that they could be a little softer.
-1	These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings.  In addition, the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides.  Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers, but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top.  This way I just change the multi-use pad and I don't have to wash the changing pad cover very often.
+1	This changing pad cover works great on the Especially for Baby Contour Changing Pad. I have one in white and one in green (the green matches my Malawi bedding really well.) I washed and dried them many times. All of the stains came out and they stayed soft and didn't shrink much. I did have to stretch them a bit to get them on, but once in place they fit perfectly. The straps on the pad I have are attached at the bottom so I didn't need to cut any holes in the cover in order to be able to use the straps. I also use small changing pads so that I don't have to change and wash the cover that often. I like that I can put my baby on something soft and warm instead of the cold plastic pad. I definitely recommend getting these.
+1	This terry cloth cover has been a lifesaver. It covers the cold vynil of my changing pad. It cover the big fat rips in my vynil changing pads too, so that you would never know that its ripped. It has caught numerous undiapered poops and pees and went right into the wash without having to wipe a thing up. That was my favorite quality of it.I have two of these so that when one is in the wash the other is on the changing pad. The only beef that I have with it is that after the first wash, one of the Terry covers ripped at the seam. Thats ok though, it was fixed quickly with a few stitches. No matter what it was a GREAT BUY.
+1	These covers are very comfy and the fit is pretty decent (in my opinion). However, I don't really use them much. I found out pretty early on that it's easier to just change my son on the uncovered changing pad because he is constantly spitting up, urinating and pooping on the pad.  I was having to wash the covers every day! Now I just bring them out when we have visitors (like the fine linens, ha ha!)
+1	We got this as a gift at our baby shower two years ago. I am very glad we did. This is almost a MUST have for babies.The range is fantastic. I can be outside watching my two year old while my baby sleeps. I know that I will be able to hear her. Not only is the range great but it also picks up the smallest sounds, I hear my baby rolling over in her crib when this is on. As an added bonus, I have not found this to be a battery eater.In my opinion having a moniter is not the most important thing to have if you are having a baby. However, it is one of the more useful things if you want to have some measure of freedom while the baby is napping or if your child sleeps clear across the house from where you sleep.
+1	I was really not looking forward to having to spend a ton of money on a monitor. I found this one by accident. Since we have had it has worked perfectly. It really is crystal clear I can hear the baby's 1st stirring. I can even hear my husband doing baby talk when he forgets the monitor is on lol. I am very glad I found an affordable option that works perfectly for us.
-1	We've been through three of these. Two were total junk out of the box. One worked very well.The first one we got didn't work at all. It was totally useless. The static was so loud we could barely make out noises from the babies room. But, we sent it back and exchanged it for a new one. The new worked great. So, we ordered another one for the other kid's room. This 3rd one was total junk. So, 2 out of 3 were junk. But, the one that did work, we really like. For me, this explains the mixed reviews on this product. Poor quality control.As far as the one that did work, here are some more details about why I liked it.We've tried a few monitors. This one had the least static. For us, static is the most important issue. We hate it. We use the baby monitors primarily at night, so that we can hear if the kids wake up in the middle of the night. If the monitors have a lot of static it keeps US from getting to sleep.The next most important issue is unnecessary beeping. Some of the other monitors we've used periodically loose the signal from the baby's room, and then automatically reconnects after a few seconds. Each time they loose the signal they beep loudly to let us know. This always wakes us up. This can happen a dozen or more times each night. No good. THIS monitor does NOT beep when it looses the signal, or maybe it just never looses the signal... either way we're sleeping much better now.
+1	The unit is about 4 feet away from the crib and every sound the baby makes can be clearly heard. It even picks up the sound of the a/c unit. I can remain sitting in the chair that's 12 feet away from the unit, nursing the baby and ask my sons in the living room, where the parent unit is located, to bring me a glass a water. I love that the parent unit can be used without batteries.
+1	Maybe the best $ deal I found so far. I would not be with out one of these. This one is very clear and loud. I would buy another any day.
+1	We had actually gotten this monitor for free through a promotional offer at Babies R Us. I was skeptical at first because it was free, but once we got it home it worked great! A little bit of static, but nothing compared to our other monitor.We had an expensive montior before this that had TONS of static and threw it right in the back of their closet once we got this one!
+1	FINALLY HAD OUR BABY AND GOT TO TRY IT OUT..THE FIRST TIME I HOOKED IT UP WAS WHEN I RECIEVED IT, I DID HEAR THE NEIGHBORS MONITOR A LITTLE..BUT ALMOST ALL BABY MONITORS WILL HAVE THAT PROB. UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ALOT OF $..BUT THIS HAS 2 CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM.. SO JUST SWITCH IT..THAT SIMPLE..I HAVE HAD IT ON FOR LAST FEW DAYS AND WORKS PERFECT..VERY SENSITIVE, AND ALMOST NO HISSING OR BUZZING AT ALL.. AND DOESNT NEED TO BE TURNED UP VERY LOUD..JUST SET IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE CRIB ON A TABLE....VERY HAPPY WITH IT
+1	I was given this as a gift and LOVE it! There is NO static at all and I can even hear my baby breathing! I recommend this to everyone!
-1	You get what you pay for... For $17 you should not expect a lot. It does its job, but with quite some statics in the background. It's working OK for me, but I regret not spending some more for a better quality monitor.
+1	I love this monitor more than my expensive VIDEO monitor.  It has Crystal clear sound just as stated and works REALLY WELL in my 2700 sqft home.  Baby can be downstairs and I'll be upstairs on the other side of the house and hear EVERYTHING that is going on in that room.  One time while he was sleeping in his crib with the window shut, I could even hear the birds chirping away outside.  Love this monitor and wished I had bought it sooner.
+1	this is a bare bones baby monitor, but it does what it's supposed to do. we get strong reception throughout our 3 level house with ceramic tile floors and thick walls.  we can hear even very quiet things like our girl's soft snoring and the rustling of sheets.  i have no need for a super fancy monitor -- i just want to know if the baby is asleep or awake and needs tending to.  this monitor is all i need for that.we've been using this monitor for about 6 months now and have had no problems with it. i was a bit hestitant to order when i saw how many people had problems with the product, but thought it was worth a shot.
-1	This monitor is awful.  Do not waste your money.  It certainly isn't "crystal clear."  I can't hear my son in the next room.  Often times I will wake up to another family waking up.  How awkward.
+1	I just purchased this because our other monitor was going on the fritz.  I love it.  Our other monitor always interfered with our wifi and had lots of static.  This is crystal clear.
+1	I'm so grateful for this monitor. The price was just right and it's just the item I need to quickly get to my baby when she awakes from naps, etc. The clarity is perfect for our large 3-bedrm apartment.
-1	I had to return this item because it didn't work right from the start.  It made very loud static and if someone talked or cried, it would only change the sound of the static slightly.  I really wanted it to work too- it had all the features that I needed and I loved the price.  I didn't try a second one since I really needed a monitor and didn't have the time to mess around with something that might not work.
+1	I Love this monitor.  Even though it's not THE GREATEST, it works great for being under $20.
+1	I was among the parents who were really upset by the news about BPA in children's bottles -- especially because I exclusively pumped milk for my son, which meant that his milk was not only served but also stored in plastic bottles. We switched to glass shortly after the news broke.The Evenflo glass bottles are certainly a great buy -- the price is fantastic! I wasn't wild about the rubber nipples that came with the bottles, but I just pitched them and used the nipples we'd been using. (Just about any standard-size, as opposed to wide, nipple will fit these bottles.) I also feel like glass just gets "cleaner" than plastic ... that's probably not true, but the glass doesn't get scratched and cloudy like plastic, so the bottles seem more pristine to me!Of course, the best part about glass bottles is that glass is inert. So there are pretty much zero worries about anything leaching into the milk (or formula).Now, the downside ... these suckers are HEAVY! We almost never used the larger bottles, because when filled, they just weighed a ton. And if you've never been smacked in the face with a bottle by a toddler ... well, let's just say these ones are way more painful than the plastic ones!And, unsurprisingly, glass can break. These are quite solid, though, and I think we only ever broke two -- one at home (it was dropped on a hardwood floor) and one at an airport (my son threw it onto a chair with a metal arm ... whoops!).Since my son is no longer drinking anything from bottles except a little water at bedtime, we've switched to BPA-free plastic, just for convenience (and this co-sleeping family's safety!). But when our next baby is born and I'm pumping at work, we will DEFINITELY be storing the milk in my glass Evenflo bottles.
+1	These are good basic bottles.  Going to the baby store and shopping for baby bottles as a new parent was daunting.  There's a litany of choices and every imaginable variation on design.  How do you choose?  For us, it became simple when we decided to stick to glass bottles.  There aren't many choices out there in glass, and those that are available are usually very expensive.  Our daughter has had no problems eating whatsoever so I can't say anything about any of the specialty bottles on the market, but for most babies, I can't imagine needing more than a basic bottle.  These are more or less the time tested glass baby bottle.  Basic and no frills, but solid and sturdy.  We like them a lot, and the price is very affordable.
+1	These little bottles are surprisingly strong and light weight for what they are, which is a glass bottle.  While they can shatter, it takes a lot to get them there thanks to their compact build.  On top of that, you don't need to worry about BPA.The only problem with these bottles is that they have to be screwed down just right to allow airflow into the bottle and prevent baby from gulping air.  This can be solved with a nipple that Gerber puts out made of brown silicone that has a cross cut in the side of the nipple.  It's absolutely perfect for these little bottles.
+1	We love these small glass bottles.  They are thick glass so we haven't had any problems with breakage.  They also hold up great in the dishwasher.  The smaller size is also more comfortable when feeding the baby.  The nipples and rings work well, no leaking.  It's nice not to have to worry about chemicals with these old school glass bottles.
+1	I am usually against things made of plastic, even though those without BPA. So I choose these bottles for my baby and so far so good. The only downside is that the slow-flow nipples flow too fast for him and he chokes on them. I had to purchase nipples to fit these bottles and it's hard to find the right ones. I ordered some Dr. Brown standard nipples, hoping to fit the bottles well.
+1	These are great bottles. I used them from day one until 6 months old. The only reason I don't use them anymore is my daughter is interested in holding her own bottle sometimes now and plastic is easier for her to hang onto because it's lighter. I love the glass bottles though because they keep the milk cool longer, important when pumping at work and using one of those little coolers. And they heat the milk up faster when placed in a warm water bath. They're very sturdy - I've dropped them several times and they haven't cracked or chipped. These come with nipples and the covers. I highly recommend these.
-1	REALLY FAST FLOW. It chokes the baby. Please dont use it with newborns as its too much flow and air and it creates colics
+1	I had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an Avent bottle (which my first took beautifully) so I called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice.  They suggested the Evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple.  They worked great.  After swearing by Avent with my first, I never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an "old-fashioned" type bottle.  It works though so I will stick with them.
+1	I was concerned about all the BPA fuss and considering that according to studies ALL plastic bottles can be harmful, I decided to find an alternative.. Although, I still use the playtex drop ins once in a while, when I'm giving my baby water or we're on the go, because its convenient. Anyway, back to the point, these bottles have been great! I noticed that with my plastic bottles (NUK- although I love NUK nipples) would still smell funky after several washes AND having them in boiling water. These however, are very easy to clean and SMELL clean! I didn't like the nipples it came with, so I bought NUK regular nipples to go with them, it fit perfect and my son liked it ! I saw reviews that said the medela nipples went along with it too, but I prefer nuk since I have found it is less confusing for my son (since I Breast feed and bottle feed)I got the 4oz pack of 3 for about $5 at target and that's enough for me, I recently purchased the 8oz 3pack from babiesrus for 6.99... GREAT BUY OVER ALL!
+1	I don't know why people are still buying plastic bottles for tiny babies, it's not like they are going to hold the bottle, they are too young!  Do yourself, your baby, and the environment a favor and use glass bottles for as long as possible!
+1	I was very happy to find these, and at such a good price, after looking for glass bottles at several retail stores. I have not had any issues with these bottles. I have not tried the nipples that came with them, as I was given specific nipples to use that mimic natural. The outer ring and bottle work with all of the nipples I have. Great product.
+1	These are ok, thick glass so thats great but its so hard to read the side. I think if they redid their molding it might be a little nicer to read. Other then that they serve their purpose. I purchased this so that the breastmilk could sit in the fridge a couple of days. Mine was getting an odor from the plastic bottles. Problem solved with glass. So I pump into the plastic so I can easily see a measurement then I transfer it into here.
+1	best bottles for your money these old school bottles are not expensive and work better than plastic all the time
+1	I like these bottles mostly because they are glass. However, comparing to highier quality glass bottles like lifefactory these break so easily.
+1	Even flo is a good product but there are other brands out there. This is what we chose and will try something else for the next baby.
+1	Concerned about the chemicals in plastic bottles?  Me too!  I was thrilled to find that Amazon had these glass ones in stock.  Now I don't have to worry about warming my breastmilk for the babysitter or my husband to give my little one.  A great buy!
+1	These are simple glass baby bottles.  They're not fancy, but they have no nasty chemicals. I know that the plastic bottles are now all BPA free, but who knows what chemical they'll discover next year that's been leeching out of our plastic and poisoning us all this time.These bottles are compatible with my medela pump and can take the same lids, which is convenient.  However, for a breast-fed baby, even these so-called slow flow nipples are way too fast, and caused my baby to choke.  I bought Dr. Brown's nipples, which work great.  I now have these in 4 oz and 8 oz sizes.
+1	These bottles have been perfect for us.  We started bottle-feeding out of necessity when our baby was only 6 weeks old, and these bottles have worked perfectly.  They're BPA free, which means we don't have to worry about heating them.  We haven't had any trouble with the nipples, and we're currently using the Stage 2 (3-6 months) size.We love these bottles and their classic design.  And the price is great (BPA-Free plastic bottles often cost $12 each).  If you are bottle-feeding, I would recommend getting at least 12-15 of them so you don't have to wash and sterilize bottles everyday.
+1	I'm not sure what &quot;not impressed&quot; review meant by it bunches up...it depends on the mattress.  I got the Sealy Superpedic Firm mattress and the cover fits perfectly.  Quilting gives extra comfort and it's thick and waterproof.
+1	I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition.  I have about 4 of them and they are essential.  I use John Lennon receiving blankets (6 is a good number) with an quilted absorbing pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad. I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on. It's nearly impossible to do when you've had a c-section, and not a good idea to strain yourself.
+1	I purchased two of these mattress pads two years ago for my son's crib.  This pad is so easy to put on and take off the mattress.  It fits a standard crib mattress PERFECTLY, and lays nice and flat.  It washes up easily, and does NOT shrink!  It's soft and durable, and it has NEVER leaked!  Oh, and compared to many mattress pads that cost up to $19.99 each- this pad is a super deal!I was so pleased with this product that I'd buy it all over again- and I will.  We are expecting TWINS this spring, and I plan on purchasing two more mattress pads for our second crib!I reccommend purchasing TWO for those middle of the night messes, that way you can change the sheets and pad in the middle of the night and not worry about washing the soiled pad till you wake up the next morning.  :)
-1	It pilled up with the wash and dry{tumble low}! AND it shrunk just the tinest bit so to annoy you because it fits but not quite and you broke your nail trying to get it to touch the bottom of the mattress! Grrrrrr.....
+1	My son used his "Kid-Ding fitted mattress cover" for over a year. It had gotten kind of gross so I decided to run quickly to the store to pick up a replacement. I made the mistake of not reading the details. This company Kid-Ding makes TWO different mattress covers that look almost identical if you don't read between the lines! About the same size, one is a Kid-Ding FLAT mattress cover and the other is a Kid-Ding FITTED mattress cover.I wasted my money cause I couldn't return it once I opened it and realized the one I got at the storeWaterproof Crib & Toddler Bed Pad - 27 x 50 - Whitedidn't have a fitted skirt to wrap around the mattress! I tried to make the best of that one, but it was AWFUL! Underneath the crib sheet, it slips and slides all over the place and crinkles up like crazy! What a disaster!I went online to make sure I get the correct one this time, and I did!!! This one is a fitted mattress cover by the same company and is just PERFECT! Wraps around the crib mattress flawlessly and doesn't move an inch! It stays put and makes slipping on the crib sheet so much easier!!! I have since bought another one! They're great and reversible. I machine wash mine and air dry -- DO NOT put it in the dryer!
+1	I have been washing and drying it (low heat) with no problems. It fits well. Just don't scrub really hard when you spot clean it, because I noticed a lot more &#34;wear and tear&#34; from that. Other than that, it's just what I was looking for.
+1	I have an average sized mattress and this fits perfectly!  It is super easy to install!  If it &quot;bunches up&quot; like some others suggest, it is because it isn't put on the mattress correctly.  A little tug, and it goes right in place... kind of like a normal bed sheet, know what I mean?After washing, many lint balls pile up, but it is durable in the fact that it isn't falling apart!  Just because it collects lint balls doesn't make it any less durable in my honest opinion.I recommend at least two of these!
+1	My baby would take the bottle with a lot of bouncing fussing etc. sometimes, but I was on maternity leave so I didn't really mind the work cause bottle were occasional and I could always switch to BF if I needed to. But at 14.5 weeks I had to go back to work and there is nothing worse than A)leaving your baby to go back to work and B)being told that he won't take the bottle so that your normally happy baby is crying and fussy all day long.I was using the nipple that came with the drop-ins and it's very round and the tip seems harder and rounded too. Not exactly like the shape I am when he's breastfeeding. I had seen these in Babies R Us and didn't get them because it said medium flow. After about 3 days of my caregiver telling me he just hates the bottle I hopped on here and looked for another nipple because I had already looked in the store and there wasn't a lot of selection. I read the reviews which lead me to believe you shouldn't trust the flow speed when comparing the two nipples so I decided to go get these. The next day my caregiver text me and it said "I love these nipples!" He took them right away, she said it was 100% difference and now he eats when I'm away.If you use this system and baby doesn't like it very much switch to these nipples and see if it helps. My good friend is pregnant and I gave her these as part of her shower gift. I feel they are closer to a real breastfeeding experience and these should come with the bottles.
+1	Great for vintage baby bottle collection; need for old Playtex bottles that are no longer made.  Hard to find these !
-1	For what these nipples cost they were a total disappointment! They are no different from ordinary nipples that cost 50% less and my LO still hated them! Also after using these nipples my LO would tend to be extra rough and pulled at my boobies
+1	My baby is breast fed and I needed to start pumping and bottle feeding before heading back to work after 12 wks of maternity leave. Baby would NOT take ANY nipple out there! We tried over 8 different nipples and bottle types. FINALLY this nipple worked! I believe most of it was my prayers asking the Lord to please help this baby take the bottle, but the nipple is the only one that he would take to! Also, amazon is one of the only places I've found that you can actually purchase this nipple! Great buy!
+1	My baby says they feel just like the real deal. He enjoys them almost as much as the real ones. He would definitely recommend them. They have great flow that doesnt leak yet the baby doesnt collapse the nipple from extreme suckling.
+1	Used it for more than 4 months and still as good as new. The quality is really good.Got it together with thishttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00433OQO6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00433OQO6&linkCode;=as2&tag;=travguid0ca-20
+1	I use these Avent nipples with Avent bottles. I just wish they were a little cheaper since you have to buy so many of them in such quick succession.
+1	I love the ease of the avent bottles for feeding, cleaning, transporting.....everything.  When I found out the bottle design changed, I didn't want to have to re-buy all new bottles ( because the nipple design changed to fit and perform with the new bottle too).  I went to several local stores that were already sold out so came here to stock up.  I bought all the sizes I will need in the future.  Also, these nipples fit in the avent trainer sippy cups.  This is great for my little one since he didn't understand how to use the spout on the one that came with the cup.
+1	This is a good bottle nipple which of course fits the phillips avent bottles.  Even though this is a slow flow nipple my 3 month old baby did and still at 4 months does struggle with it on occasion for being too fast.  In our case there's also a little bit of nipple preference so I am not sure that it is entirely the nipple's fault (as in not being slow enough).  Perhaps in another month or two we'll revisit this review.
+1	I purchased these for my baby girl I have used the other AVENT nipples for younger babies with no issues. Great product, no issues.
+1	Love the flow of milk for my daughter but these do leak if not upright. Definitely not ok for when my toddler is in bed, falls asleep, and didn't finish her milk!
+1	These nipples lasted about 6 months before the rubber started to rip. I've had to replace about half of them because the tip where the holes are ripped and now there's just a gaping rubber flap. But despite the need to periodically replace them, they are a good nipple and I haven't had any other issues with them.
+1	My daughter has been using the Breast Flow bottles and nipples, but we were given one of these bottles as a gift.  Our daughter now uses both.  The only thing I've found is, we have to replace the nipples more often (but it could be because she is teething).  They are a little difficult to get clean, as they are narrow.
-1	I have a 4.5 month old and these newborn nipples are too fast for my breastfed baby. He guzzles a 4 ounce bottle in less than 5 minutes, which is HORRIBLE for a breastfed baby. He doesnt know when hes full and ends up spitting up a ton after feeds. He also ends up with an upset tummy and is extra gassy because of them. Since this is the slowest flow Avent offers, Ive had to look for new bottles. I wish they made slower flow nipples because I really do like the bottles.
+1	I am the Grandmother to 2 infants and 1 toddler. One of the infants lives in our household and I can state that Avent is at the top of my list when it comes to bottles and nipples. No excess gas is produced, no bags to fuss with and have to toss away, clean up is simple just as mixing the formula is simple. No extra parts to have to put inside the bottle and try to remember if you are supposed to boil them or just wash them. I love Avent.
+1	My baby likes these nipples, and they actually work better than the Newborn nipples. My baby always gags and gets too much from the newborn size, but she has no problems at all with these.
+1	Great product. My newborn baby was swallowing the formula very fast when I used the 3 months size so I ordered this one. It is just perfect.Love it.
+1	I got these for my 9.month-old as i had already bought the number 4s and the flow was too fast for her. Number 3s are perfect for her now at 9 months.
+1	These are the BEST nipples I have ever used!  I call them dial a nipple!  You line the number, you want to use, up with the babies nose and it's smooth sailing!  They are variable, numbered 1,2,&3.  1 is for slow flow, 2 is a faster flow and 3 is for cereals or thicker liquids. These are great!
+1	My granddaughter is eating baby food now, but for the more runny foods, I find it much easier to mix the food with formula & give it to her in a bottle.  I also mix cereal and feed it this way, especially first thing in the morning, when she is impatient to eat.  I had a difficult time cutting holes in the regular nipples to allow proper flow of this mixture.  It ended up flowing either too fast or not fast enough.  This nipple works great, because as she is nursing, I can simply turn the bottle to the best spot for the perfect flow.  What a great idea!  Happy baby makes Grandma happy!
+1	These are very durable nipples. They've withstood numerous washings/sterilizing and they maintained their appearance and function. The Slow flow is a good flow for babies that are both bottle fed and breast fed. These nipples fit the original Avent bottles not the newer Avent Natural Flow bottles. These were good for a few weeks until we inadvertently bought the new Avent Natural Flow bottles. Since we were stuck with our purchase, we tried it and now our baby wouldn't go back to these.
+1	We started with number 1 nipple until my daughter was about 2 or 3 months, then switched to number 2 nipple, which she used until 5 or 6 months. It worked great. We moved to the number 3 nipple until she was 1 year old, when she stopped using the bottle completely.
+1	Our baby is over 6 months and we still use these nipples.  When I'm not at work she is breast fed.  This slow flow nipple helps her work at getting the milk similar to when she's nursing.
+1	Hold up for multiple children. Do well in dishwasher in a kid container / rack that we got from Target.
+1	THEY ARE I WAS I SPECTED, GOOD QUALITY, GOOD PRESENTATION, PERFEECT PRICE, GOOD FOR CHILD AND GOOD FOR BABIES FROM 9 MONTHS
+1	Everywhere else sales these for almost $10 each!The newborn (one hole) size is perfect for breastfeeding babies. Love this brand!
+1	After I dropped a nipple down the garbage disposal while washing I was in the market for a few replacements.  The replacements seem to be holding up better than the originals!
+1	I still use these nipples for my 1 year old when I have to pump from time to time and he's never had any issues with them. They work great and are very reasonable. Love Avent!!
+1	I like the avent nipples because they don't deform like the medela ones. I haven't tried many nipples since he seemed to do fine on these. These are the newborn flow ones and although they are the slowest, it's still not slow enough. I'm trying to breast feed and sometimes he just gets impatient with me (I have a low supply) and wants the bottle. Sometimes I oblige depending on how loud he is and how tired I am.But these are easy to clean and switch out too. I bought these to put into some "2" nipples I had since I got a set of these avent bottles.
+1	This nipple works great for both my babies. Does not interfere with breastfeeding. No problems latching (on either) going back and forth from breast to bottle.
+1	These bottle nipples work as intended. Our baby never did the jump to the largest ones (I.e. fast flow, etc), so we had to keep using this kind for several months. The thing is that, at the end of their lifetime, the 2 holes on top widen and allow more liquid to go through. When that happened, the baby would refuse to drink anymore and it was really frustrating. I'm not knocking off any stars on this review because it is not really a defect or downside. It's jut the result of normal &#8220;&#34;wear an tear&#8221;. Just be mindful of it.
+1	works well, felt like the baby was fighting with getting enough milk fast enough. Put these on and now she can keep up
+1	very good product this brand offers quality products and have bought several for baby products sincerely recommend this brand, it is best for babies and children
-1	We brought these nipples based on all the raving reviews and write up's online.  However our newborn is now here and wasn't putting on enough weight.  Our pediatrician told us these are the worse brand of bottles on the market for newborns and shouldn't be used until the baby is at least 5 months old.  The reason for this is because the nipple is too large for a newborn to latch on to and they're unable to get enough.  We are now using the Medela nipples instead and he's feeding so much better.
+1	Just what I needed. Shipped fast. Very satisfied with the product, Right now moving towards sippy cups, good luck with that
-1	I wouldn't know if this product works or not because it doesn't fit the bottles I have bought from the same company, i.e. Philips AVENT Natural Glass Bottles. Make sure you have the right bottle before you buy this.
+1	I added 1 tsp of cereal for each 1 oz of formula and my son was able to eat without any issues. I gave it to him with the II mark facing him. He normally uses the size 3 classic nipples. The flow didn't seem to fast or too slow. I'd definitely recommend these.
+1	don't waste your time trying to find a cheaper, generic nipple for your Avent bottles!!  ours are so old they don't even indicate which newer Avent nipple is correct... so figured 'classic' ought to do it!!  it does!
+1	We love Philips Avent bottles and nipples. They are easy to use and easy to clean. It was easy to switch my son from Dr. Browns to this.
+1	I love all avent products,so easy and wonderful cant go wrong with them.They are just the best.Highly recommend to all mommy out there
+1	I have used Avent nipples for all 3 of my kids.  They are a great product at a great price on Amazon especially if you can get the free shipping!
+1	I love Avent bottles & nipples!  They hold up over time & my son has had zero issues with them - no gas, no hesitation when transitioning from breast to bottle, nothing.
+1	For our son as a newborn. No problems with cleaning or melting in the dishwasher. Avent products have done us well since our son was born.
+1	This are a little harder consistency than the size 3 nipples, which is good because now my 6th month old daughter is sucking too hard on the size 3 nipples and they are caving in. Perfect for 6 month olds!
+1	Our son has bad congestion and it takes a lot of work for him to eat. Switching up to a level 3 has been great for him in terms of being able to take in more forumla.  He was eating anywhere from 30 to 120 cc before, now he is eating 150+ because he isn't expending all his energy trying to breathe and suck at the same time.  It's also cut down on the amount of time it takes to feed him.  Have not noticed more spit up or gas with the level 3 compared with the level 1.  Wish I had started using these earlier but all the nurses and doctors recommended using the Preemie nipple!
+1	My husband installed these on every piece of furniture that could tip in our house. It took him about an afternoon, but we have a lot of furniture. They are easy enough to unhook when you need to move something, but they hold well. Cheaper than I could find anywhere else.
+1	Works alright. Bought some from ToysRus and had to return them because they didnt work, thats why i turned to amazon for these. These worked much better and hold
-1	These brackets were very frustrating to install.  Once you had them screwed in place, they were difficult to adjust to make them tight.  In addition, they are bulky and white, making them very noticeable eyesores.  There are much less cumbersome safety straps out there!
+1	Very sturdy hardware, easy to use, everyone should have these. Thanks for the great reviews for helping me see these straps were the ones to buy.
+1	I bought these after my son yanked open a drawer on a 5 drawer dresser and it tipped and fell on him. I was standing right there and was able to catch it and break the fall. If it had fallen on him I doubt he could have survived. We strapped everything in the house to the walls and found these straps to be easy to use. Its an added peace of mind having these in case I am ever not there to catch a falling dresser. Buy them, use them, prevent serious injury.
+1	We had a bookshelf in our daughters room that we didn't want her pulling over, and these worked great. Perfect solution, no issues installing.
+1	We purchased these to secure a large mirror and bookcase to keep our toddler safe.  My husband said these were pretty easy to install (and he's not the handy type) and that they took no time at all.  They are secure to the wall and piece of furniture and I'm confident that the furniture will not topple over when my toddler is pulling and leaning on it.
+1	I purchased several different types of anti tip furniture straps, this was the most expensive, but seemed very sturdy.  I used both straps for a very large piece of furniture.
-1	These might have worked better if I had bought different screws. I just couldn't get these to work at all.
+1	We bought these when we converted our twins cribs to toddler beds and they had more freedom.  Protect your kids! Bolt down furniture so they don't get hurt!
+1	Was able to secure a 6 foot bookcase without any issues. Screws were not a problem. Always possible for a long screw to break, just drill a pilot hole. Straps seemed sturdy. If you want them flush to the wall, you need to install the wall piece well below the piece attached to the unit (several inches.)
+1	You can never be too careful when you have toddlers at home.  I'm not one of those moms that has the entire house baby proofed.  I believe more in teaching my child to not touch certain things so that when we go to other people's home that are not baby proofed, she will "survive".  However, these come in handy since most little ones are big into climbing.
+1	This is a wonderful gate when you have your hands full, as I often do.  We've used gates for years with our pets, and this is by far superior to any others we've used.  We actually went out and bought a second gate when we saw how great they are.
+1	I used this gate at a family member's house, and I loved it, so I bought one for our place. However, it is too small for our normal, standard width hallway. I have to buy the extension for it. It's a great gate, but I think it should be a little wider. I was REALLY looking forward to putting it up and containing my crazy toddler, but now I have to wait on the mail man to bring the extension kit.
+1	I love that this gate installs very easily, and the gate swings both ways.  We installed this in a bedroom frame, and easily moved it to over the stairs. I love that it doesn't leave any residue on the walls. Be sure the use the wrench it comes with which makes it very easy.The measurements it gives you are pretty accurate for the max length it can do, our stairway is just over 39" and it barely doesn't fit with the first extension so we had to add another.
+1	Good:-Easy to open with one hand.-Works great for keeping the dog out of the nursery.-Really like the pressure mounting, easy to install.Bad:-Gate creeks
+1	Fantastic gate extremely easy to install.  There are no little places where kids can get their fingers pinched so I feel safe closing it even when my extremely curious and active 8 month old is crawling and climbing on it.  it's a tall gate so i don't worry about her going over it at all and it takes force to push the step down but easy to do.  Buy it for the entrance to hallways or in doorways where you want the door open sometimes but don't want babies in and out of that room.
+1	UPDATE:  I have been using this gate with the New Baby.  He is now 20 months old and there are absolutely no complaints...just praise.  The pedal seems to be improved as I have yet to have it break.  I still recommend this gate above and beyond all the rest.  Matter of fact I am about to buy another one this weekend to put upstairs.I used this gate for both of my girls and eventually a little girl that my MIL babysat.  It's very durable and the ease of use and set up is great. It's also a plus that the fram stays in place and you dont' have to remove it all the time like other gates. The one part that might give out will be the pedal.  My husband broke it once when we first got this because the animal that he is put too much weight on it (the gate stands up nicely to regular pressure).  I do have to say that the company was great when I called them for a replacement part and sent it out the very same day. I am now 4 1/2 months pregnant and will buy a new one.  I have no doubts or bad things to say about this gate.  It was well worth the money. I had tried several other gates and was not happy at all with any of them.
-1	I have several baby gates so it's not that I didn't install it right. Its just that my daughter could rip this one right out. The others that I had held up when she would do her monkey in a cage routine but this one would rip out. It holds on for a while but still she can tear it down. So I wouldn't recommend it.
+1	We needed a sturdy gate at the top of our stairs that was pressure mounted because we had to mount it on both sides to our wood balusters.  We did tons of research and finally settled on this one.  We couldn't be happier with our pick!  It is extremely sturdy, doesn't move in the slightest (and we use it ALL day long), and is well built.  The hands-free option is an absolute must if you're getting this because you have small children.  I can step on the release and nudge the gate open with my knee, so my hands are still securely on my child in my arms.  I cannot imagine a child being able to open it because it does take quite a bit of pressure, in fact, our two year tries to step on it and can't budge it.  The gate swings nicely in both directions and easily latches back in place.  I don't especially like that the bar is underneath, but I also understand that there's no way around it.  I will say that at least the designers tried to alleviate the annoyance of the bar by adding in slopping plastic mounds around the bar.  They're not great but definitely better than just the bar.  We also had to get the extension and it works great.  Like other reviewers, I should mention that when you order the extension it's only ONE extension (I think about 5 inches or so), not two separate extensions, which is a little misleading in the description.  We were right on the edge of needing another extension but it actually works great with just the one.  Also, when you pull it out of the box it appears be bent, but it's made that way and it works once it's in.  It's also easy to assemble and install.  I highly recommend this gate!  We might even get another one for the bottom of the stairs because it works so well.
+1	This gate is very simple to install, but time-consuming to get the perfect fit. I'd say it took me a solid half an hour the first time.  I recently moved it to a doorway and spent just 15 minutes (since I am now an experienced baby gate installer).  It is tension mounted with no hardware or tools required.  It does come with a little plastic wrench, which is useful for the final tightening once you have the gate in place. It does take quite a bit of elbow grease as well.I expected the gate to swing closed more easily. You have to stop and use your hand, foot, or knee to push it all the way closed - at least on mine. I do find myself using my hands most the time to make sure it's closed, but if I do have my arms full it can definitely be operated without my hands.My baby girl is 8 months old and spends a lot of time standing at the gate (and pulling on it).  I like that if she has her hands on the gate, there is nowhere for her fingers to get pinched as I open it.  Well, there is one place she could; if she ever messed with the foot pedal near the bar that it's connected to.  I have found that if I get my foot too close to that bar when operating the foot pedal, I get a good pinch.I am using the gate in a doorway and the door is able to close normally.  The braces come off the doorjamb just ever so slightly, but it is still secure.I have also used it in a hallway with one extension. In the hall, the top two braces were affixed on the wall, and the bottom two on floorboards, which come out about 1/2" and I still got a secure fit. The hall is 38" and one extension did the trick, but the extensions are about $16 so it could get expensive if you needed to make it wider.  The manufacturer recommends only going up to 44".  When I removed the gate from the hall there was damage to the wall under one of the top braces - it removed paint and texture.
+1	We are so glad that we bought this gate. We use it in the entrance to our son's room. It keeps him in and our 3 dogs out. Completly hands free is such a plus!!!!!! Simple to use!!! Fits very snug...it isn't going anywhere. The vertical only slats are great because our son tries to climb this gate and I truely believe that if we had bought a traditional gate with vertical and horizontal slats that he would be able to climb it!!! I recommended this to all our friends already!!!
+1	I purchased one of these back in 2003 (for our dog).  Now I wanted another pressure-mounted, hands-free gate for our toddler and this is the product I immediately thought of purchasing.I was extremely disappointed when I received the gate and realized that there is no longer a ramp to help prevent tripping over the lower bar.  I thought that feature was one of the main advantages of the older gate version.  Why would the manufacturer discontinue that?  Surely it would not cost a lot more to include that piece, and I think parents would be willing to pay a few extra dollars for added safety.Fortunately I was able to find another product that solved the problem for me:Tee-Zed Dreambaby No-Trip Gate Ramp, WhiteIt's not as perfect a fit as the original ramp, but it still works very well.  Kudos to Dreambaby for thinking of selling such a product.  I wish The First Years product manager would reconsider including the ramp with this gate.
+1	I have a puggle and boxer, and neither one can jump this gate or accidentally open it. It's the best gate I've ever owned- and I've gone through a LOT of gates!! It is so easy to install- did it myself and I'm not usually good at putting things together. Easy!! Great when I'm taking groceries in the house and don't have an extra hand to fiddle with one of those tricky gate locks. LOVE IT!!! It doesn't leave "marks" on the trim or "damage" the walls... some reviewers must be over-tightening their gates if they're having that much trouble. It also has NEVER shifted out of place- ever... and I've had it in a high traffic area (where it's used over and over throughout the day)for nearly 3 months. Great gate- worth the money!
+1	I purchased this gate when my son was learning to crawl ... as stuck it on the bathroom door frame to keep him out - it was wonderful!  I could be in the bathroom watching him in the hall as I did my hair or cleaned, without him getting into the toilet or pulling the blowdrier down.  He learned to pull himself up with this gate, and I feel like it is extremely sturdy.  I love that when guests came over, the bathroom door would still shut, and they all loved that it was so easy to use.  The pressure mounts are very secure and were very gentle on both of the appartments we have used it in as well.  This gate now is on our baby's door frame to keep 2 year old big brother out during nap time, but still let mommy hear when the baby needs her.  I love that my tall 35 lb and 39 inch 2 year old can't open it, but that for anyone over 6 that has tried it in my home, it is very simple and effortless! This is a wonderful gate, and I would (and do) recommend it to anyone!  We have used it for over 2 years now, and still love it!
+1	We've tried at least three different gates in different doorways and entrances, and this one's by far the best. It really is hands-free to open. Better yet, it closes automatically by bumping it shut, unlike some gates that require a hand to *close* them, argh.One complaint I've heard is about the foot pedal breaking off. That hasn't happened for us, and we use two of these, nor has it happened for friends (and friends of friends) who've had one of these for several years. I suspect that anyone's who broke had the gate in the entrance either too tightly or crooked. So, use the tool that comes in the box for checking the tightness, and use a level(ing device) to get it straight.
+1	This gate was very easy to put up and is very sturdy.  It is also convenient since there are no levers to pull or push with your hand to open.  It's totaly hands free leaving you to carry other things while you walk through the gate.  We thought that the opening might be a little small, but once it's up it doesn't seem so bad.
+1	This hands-free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open. You can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee. The gate is fairly easy to install (a necessary slim wrench is included in the box) and requires no screws or glue. The gate provides good protection. The bars on the gate are well-spaced so even small infants shouldn't be able to crawl through. When properly installed, it provides solid protection, although (important!) you should regularly check it to make sure it's securely affixed to the door frame. Also, over time the gate tends to bend a little, so you should use the little wrench-like tool to adjust it when necessary.In short, a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room. But this is *NOT* designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway.
+1	very good gate the only down fall is that it is only hands free gate if the mobile home or house or apartment is leveled other than that it is perfect and hand free and easy to install and it is alot harder to knock down than other baby gates my daughter could never knock this gate down no matter how hard she tried even when she was a year in a half she would stand on it and lean on it and it still wouldn't fall so it is all round a very good gate.
+1	We have a 1 year old and a 4 year old, and neither one of them can open this gate because they are not heavy enough.  We have 4 of them throughout the house.  I can open it easily carrying the baby or groceries.  It fits securely and doesn't loosen.  It is great quality.  We have had two of these for three years now and they are still in perfect condition!
+1	We love this gate, we bought one to block of the top of the staircase, and we wanted a second one t block off the living area and the kitchen... unfortunately the coverage range of this product is very limited... even with the extensions.The gate overall is made out of solid material. The kickstand takes a bit of pressure to release, but it's good to have, because my son can't accidentally push it down and open the gate.The gate area is smaller than an average to walk through, but it's not too bad.Out of all the gates we have had we like the Hands Free gate the best. It would be the only gate we purchase only if it could a bigger area.
+1	We got this gate plus two extensions, one for either side, almost a month ago for our triplets who just turned a year old. We were concerned at first if the extra extensions would be able to support the three babies sufficiently. It does! The only downfall, which I've seen mentioned a few times before, is that the available width space doesn't match up with what the gate says it can support. So if you get this and are running to the border of width, add that extra extension for sure so it's not wobbling. And after measuring and you think using the gate with both extentions will just barely fit, try it, but more than likely it will be wobbly a bit. Just keep that in mind. Otherwise, this is a great gate! We have the added baseboards along the bottom of our walls plus the tiny toe boards and because this is all pressure mounted it adjusts great. Just take your time and get things even and straight. It doesn't take long to set up, 15-20 minutes tops. It works great for us since we live in military base housing and want to avoid putting holes in the walls to fill in later. It's odd at first to get used to the foot petal but once you get used to it, it's a lifesaver! We have the Clear View Gate on the playroom which we love but for the kitchen doorway we needed something wider and more convenient with the smaller swing door since we use the kitchen more. The bar on the bottom took only a couple days to get used to and with the ramps on either side it helps with not tripping. The gate swings either way which helps too! Sooo worth the money since these things can be used for years!
+1	Product delivered on description.  Easy to use, install, and hands free.  It says it's not approved for use at the top of the stairs because the only gates approved for use at the top of the stairs are hardware mounted ones, so I just put it in the hallway right before the stairs and works great.  Although it's so sturdy, if there wasn't the rule about needing to be hardware mounted it would work for stairs.  I'm not sure how old the people's children are who said they can open this gate, but mine is 1 and there's no way he's strong enough.  In order to open the gate you have to have a good amount of leg strength that I wouldn't anticipate younger kids having.
-1	I thought this idea seemed great since my hands would be full once our baby arrived, but it did not work for us. We bought this for use in a doorway, but the foot pedal stuck out so that we never would have been able to close the door. The opening for this gate was also very narrow. We returned this for the North State Industries easy close gate, which we love.
+1	...in medical bills! Previously, we had a cheap wood, stationary gate in our hallway. I must have hefted my pregnant self and my 10 month old over that gate a hundred times a day and it was taking a serious toll on my back and knees. After about the 10th time I nearly fell over the darn thing, I went to find a new gate and saw this one. Next day I picked up at BRU (I had to get the extender peice too) and installed it.WONDERFUL. Sturdy, tall, nice to look at and it opens effortlessly. Couldn't be more thrilled. Everyone who has used it loves it because there is no fussing with latches or handgrips. Just step and nudge.
+1	We love this gate, it is so easy to install.  I just got rid of our superyard gate.  That was not very good to use because you have to climb in and out of the gate.  If you have an active child like mine, you will have to go in and out a lot.  Several times i trip over it and it's not fun when you bang your legs into the gate.  It is plastic but still it hurts!  Since we just change to this hands free gate, we are so relieved.  It's worth every penny!
+1	I purchased this gate at Babies R Us, but read the reviews first from Amazon.  I just purchased a toddler bed for my child and the gate is used to keep her in her bedroom at night.  The gate was so easy to put together and fits perfectly at the entrance of her bedroom door.  To open it, all you do is step on the foot pedal, which is needs weight to open.  The only problem I have now, is that my child closes the gate all the time.  When it's suppose to stay open.  Oh, well!!
+1	This is probably the best gate I've had so far. I really like the hands free foot peddle. I've had it for more than six months and haven't had any problems.
+1	We got this gate because we recently got 2 puppies, and have gated off all areas of our house so that they don't run all around the house causing havoc. However regular gates are such a pain, having to step over them, is a hassle. Especially while trying to carry a new baby. So this is great. Only complaints: I wish the opening was larger, it isn't huge- but to be fair, the description does give dimensions. The only other thing that is taking a while to get used to, is there is a bar at the bottom of the gate- even in the opening, so you still have to watch your step, but it is less of a hassle than having to take down gates or step over them. overall, I would recommend.
+1	This is a great gate over all--convenient, sturdy, etc. We use it at the top of the stairs. The opening seems a little narrow, but overall it's not bad.
+1	I really like this gate, it was easy to install and it looks great.  I highly recommend it but I also have metal door frames so I don't know if this would dent the wood in a regular door frame.  Though I think a small dent would be better than a screw hole...
+1	I like the look and feel of this gate and the concept that it's a "hands-free" design for opening, because let's face it--a gate that requires that you use your hands to open is worthless for a mom holding a baby.  It seems to be a pretty solid construction, and for a tension gate, it actually holds pretty well.  Not only does this gate confine pets and babies/toddlers/little kids, it seems to be adult-proof, too.  Every single adult that has come into my house has hesitated at this gate because they couldn't figure it out.  HA!There are definitely some downsides to it, but it has been serving us well as a dog and baby gate for close to two years now.Pros:- Hands-free opening- Clean, simple, solid design- Ability to add extenders which work great for wide hallways (I use one on each side of the gate)- Tension-mount system so it's movable and you don't have to put holes in your walls.Cons:- Beware if you have painted your walls recently (Recent for us was maybe a few months prior).  The rubber grip pads just ripped the paint right off when I released the tension in the holding rods.  I'm not sure if the paint on our walls is cheap or if it's because there are just too many layers of paint or what, but I ripped a large chunk out of the wall upon moving the gate.  So yeah, having to patch that sort of defeated the purpose of avoiding a gate that required mounting hardware.- Pedal can get "stuck" and become temperamental.  I think this also causes problems with closing.  You should be able to close this easily by just pushing the gate back, but it always sticks in one of the directions and requires more care to close it properly.- I don't know how, but my now almost 21 month-old has managed to open this gate maybe 10 times by now.  She refuses to tell me how and every time I try to watch her try, she acts all helpless and can't open it.  So yeah, she's apparently a step ahead of all our visiting adults who can't open this thing.Despite the fact that she can open it from time to time, I still like this gate and it has really been an important feature in our home.  Even before she was crawling or walking, it was perfect for keeping our two big dogs confined to one side of the house.  If I had to purchase a replacement gate, I wouldn't hesitate to get another one of these.
+1	My 22 month old can open doors but still can't open this gate!  Gives great piece of mind.  I love that you don't need to use your hands to open and close it.  Installed without any problems, adjusts to fit any door way in our house (old house, nothing is even...).  Grandparents love it too, ended up buying them one as well.
+1	She said it was easy to install, she had to do it her self because her hunny was in Iraq. She has a very hyper golden retriever.Perfect for protecting your baby from many diffetant things.
+1	We use this gate to block baby from going into the kitchen.  But the primary entrance/exit to our house is via the kitchen, so we needed something easy to open with your hands full.  Voila, the hands-free gate!  It is great, you can open and close it with your foot and knee just like the other reviews state.  We had to buy 2 extensions, one on each side of the gate to cover the opening to our kitchen.  They work great, we have had no problems.  I have two complaints, but they do not outweigh how much I like this gate:  First, the gate was difficult to install.  There was one part that wouldn't fit properly, my husband had to bend something with pliers to get it to fit on.  Caused about 10 minutes of extreme aggravation, haha.  Second, the pedal is so noisy when you push down on it!  I need to try some WD-40 to see if that will help, I honestly haven't tried that yet.  But still, we really like this gate and the noise problem doesn't change that fact!  Baby hangs all over it and I don't see how she would ever be strong enough to press down on the pedal herself and open it, you really do need to press hard!
-1	TL;DR if you are looking for a great gate that will function well for 6 months, and inevitably break in unrepairable ways, this is the gate for you!I loved these gates.  We bought two of them and they were relatively easy to install and had been very effective at keeping our rambunctious 2 year old out of the kitchen and hallway.  The foot petal requires quite a bit of pressure, and even kept our 6-yr old nephew contained pretty well :)That being said -- their reliability over time is *horrendous*.  These gates come with only a 90-day warranty, and both gates started breaking in obviously flawed ways within 6-months.  The first gate stopped locking shut -- which is obviously a problem for a gate that is supposed to keep a 2 year old out of places.  The problem is that the spring-loaded plastic peg can actually separate from the spring inside the end of the swinging door.  I contacted the manufacturer and their customer support was very good!  They shipped out two replacement pegs and I was able to get the door working within a few days.  That being said -- the issue will certainly happen again, as there is nothing preventing the spring from separating.  This is a clear design flaw.Weeks later our second gate broke.  This time the foot petal stopped actuating the pin, so the door will not open.  After taking off the plastic assembly for the foot petal, I found that the metal pin which connects the plastic petal to the metal arm was completely broken (in two places).  After putting the pieces together, the issue became very clear -- the metal pin is tapered quite substantially in two places -- which is exactly where the pin broke.  With people putting significant force on the foot petal to open the gate -- dozens of times a day -- is really unacceptable to have such an obvious weak point in the design of the metal pin.The problem with the pin being broken is that there's clearly no way to actually reassemble the foot petal to the actuating arm -- even with a good pin.  There is no way to fix this broken gate.  Upon contacting the manufacturer's customer service, they confirmed that there is on way to fix the foot petal and there is nothing they are willing to do to address the broken gate.In the end, we regret having bought these gates, and I am rather disappointed that the manufacturer doesn't seem to acknowledge these design flaws in their gates.  I think it also speaks volumes that they offer 1-2 year warranties on almost all of their baby products -- except the gates.  Makes you really think...
+1	This gate is really a great product. I love the fact that you don't have to hardware mount the gate (no drilling into the doorways required), and it's still very sturdy. It was incredibly easy to install, and is very safe and secure. My 18 month son knows how the gate opens, but cannot open it because of the weight required to push down on the lever. The only negatives I encountered were:1) The first Hands Free gate I purchased was not painted properly, so I had to return it for another one.2) I had to buy the 5&quot; gate extension for the gate to fit in the doorway. So, in the end, there are additional costs if the opening you intend to use the gate for is not that narrow. But all in all, it's totally worth it.
-1	I needed a gate for the top of the stairs, and searched Amazon for "baby gate top of stairs."  This gate is the second item returned.  Nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs.  Of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say DO NOT USE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS.  The gate works great in the upstairs hallway, but we'll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room.
+1	I am very pleased with this gate, we have it at the top of our stairs and it works great.  The opening isn't HUGE but it still works.  Our stairway is 35 1/2 inches wide so we did have to get the extension, it is not wobbly at all. Some advice though, don't tighten it too tight or you won't be able to get the door open.  I gave it 4 stars only because I was under the impression that it had a knee plate that you could bump to open and mine did not.  The first one I ordered was defective but Amazon was very quick to replace it with a new one and works great.  I have a 7 year old daughter and she does have a little trouble stepping down on the pedal to get it to work so I think that might take some time.  I am guessing that the people who say their infant has figured out how to do that must have super babies.  I am very pleased with this product.  The slates are wide enough for my cats to fit through as well, ok well one of them the other one is too dumb to figure that part out so she just sits there until someone opens the gate.
+1	I was fortunate to find two of these gates with two extensions each at a second hand baby store for 20 dollars each.  After the first year with my newborn, I've come to need a coupe more gates.  I have tried 4 other similar ones and quickly sent them back.  These ones are a little more expensive, but I've found that after being spoiled with the foot opening contraption of these gates, I simply cannot live without that feature in another gate.  I do need the extensions, which makes it more expensive, so I will be purchasing two more of these in the very near future!!
+1	Our little one is rolling and starting to crawl, so we bought two of these gates, one for the top of our walk-up stairs, and one for the hallway.  They are fantastic.  You have to do two things to open the gate -- push down on the foot pedal while pushing the gate forward, but because you can do these without your hands, it is perfect for when you are carrying your little one in your arms.  The foot pedal also requires a substantial push, so there is no way that the  baby (or a pet) would be able to do so on his or her own.  The material is very sturdy, so even if a toddler tried to pull herself up on the gate, it would not come undone.  The gate door also works both ways, an important feature.The one negative as far as I can tell is that when coming up the stairs, it takes a little extra coordination to step on the foot pedal.Definitely recommended.
+1	I LOVE this gate and would buy it again. I like how it swings open both ways, opens with a foot pedal so it's hands free, and is incredibly sturdy though it's pressure-mounted. My ONLY disappointment with this gate is that it doesn't fit well on our stairs. We live in a small apartment and the wall doesn't jut out far enough from the bottom step in order for the foot pedal to work. Instead, I mounted the gate in the doorway of our baby's nursery, and it is working out GREAT.
+1	This is a sturdy gate which does not damage the walls. It can be moved to another location if desired. A great purchase and can withstand being manhandled by a toddler, yet can only be opened by an adult.
+1	This gate is very high quality and a snap to install. The pressure installation won't hurt your door frames, and my 15 month old daughter hangs attacks it frequently and it doesn't budge. The pedal operation is ingenious, so much easier to open with your foot when you've got your hands full. Also swings both ways, so you can push it open whether you're coming or going.Highly recommend.
-1	Color washed off within one month of use and its a little too bulky for a newborn. Recommend trying "Baby Buddy Bear Pacifier Holder" Love them.
-1	I bought this because my older daughter had one just like it about 9 years ago. This clip is being used only when we go on car rides, so baby doesn't lose her pacifier. Well after about 4 months of occasional use the clip itself won't close all the way, so it doesn't secure to anything. Pacifier constantly falls onto the floor. Very disappointed as it's a cute design and it fit in her pacifier holder. Now its only purpose is to take up space in a landfill. Junk, do not buy!
+1	saves headaches looking for pacifiers that seem to always get lostplus it is cute and doesn't tear clothing when it gets pulled off
+1	I have a medal banister on my stairs and have been having a lot of trouble getting a gate to fit. The kidco gate in combination with the Y Spindle has given me a safe and secure option for the bottom of my stairs.
+1	This was purchased for use in a special needs classroom.  It was easy to install, easy to use, and has stood up to the abuse of being used in a school classroom.  It is much more sturdy than previously used wood gates.  The item may be a little more expensive, but the quality is well worth it!
+1	I was happy to find a gate that works for us. We use it at the bottom of our stairs along with a kidco y spindle. Not sure what other options we had for mounting to our round staircase baluster. If you have a similar staircase I would say this is the product for you!
+1	I purchased two of these gates for the bottom of my stair cases.  They were fairly easy to install even though the instructions weren't that clear.  I had to buy a 5.5 inch extension and the Y spindle pack to fit my stairs.  Once I got it all together I was very surprised at how sturdy the gates were.  They seem to be of very high quality.
+1	After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this is my favorite.  I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here's my take on three different gates.I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you're looking for.  The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and  2) the latch mechanismKidco Center Gateway:---------------------cost $85 & extensions $24  / gate is 29.5" Tall  / fits 29.25" to 37.5" doorway width  / 1" bar to step over / gate opening 22"-  Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22".  (This certainly won points from my 6'2" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others).  I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature.-  This one also had the most secure latch feature.  You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru.  I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out.- This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become "weaker" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37" and your door opening is 36.5", it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34").-  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white.-  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1" high (seems less of a tripping risk).-  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 08/04)-  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need.-  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up.-  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller.-  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it!Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate---------------------------------------------cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36" Tall / fits 28"-48" doorway width / 2" bar to step over / gate opening 19"-  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal.-  The gate opening is about 19" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider.-  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it.-  It does come with its own extensions in 5" and 10" so it more easily fits the wider doorways.-  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33" and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75" as needed).-  It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far.  I also just like the way the taller gate looks.-  It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2".-  If it fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money.First Years - Hands-Free Gate-----------------------------cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32" Tall  / fits 29"-34" doorway width / 1.5" bar to step over / gate opening 17"- My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17" wide! I'm 5'8" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However...- The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width.- Good height to the gate.- It was very sturdy in my doorway.- This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor.- Fits only up to 34" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension.-  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one.All three gates seemed to:- Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly.- Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall.- Were pretty easy to set up.- All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look "cheaper" to me than the others.Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.  Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value. Good luck with your own purchase!
+1	This gate is much better than most on the market. The design allows it to function well as a gate, yet allowing foot traffic through by the inclusion of a lockable door in the unit. The gate is made of metal, but I deducted 1 star due to the locking mechanism being made of plastic. Only time will tell how much real-world use it will stand up to. Another thing about this gate that I like is the flexibility offered by the availability of extensions -- it is possible to mount this gate pretty much anywhere needed. Overall, I am happy with this purchase.
+1	This is the second Kidco product I have purchased.  Let me start by saying that their products are some of the safest out there and I have every confidence in the security of the gates I have installed. BUT, the first gate I purchased was the standard gateway that uses hardware to install.  You can see my review there but the thing that is pertinent here is that they only included limited hardware in the box which would not work safely if installing the gate into dry wall (even when there is a stud).  So, instead of including another set of screws that would've cost them about $0.90, Kidco likes to make busy parents go buy that stuff themselves.Well, this gate has its own torturous surprise for busy parents who are trying to multitask every hour of the day.  Kidco kindly includes two extensions making this gate much more versitile than most on the market.  The thing they don't tell you is that these extensions are held in by the same tension that holds the gate into the wall.  Each of these tension screws are completely separate from one another (which is good design because it allows installation over uneaven surfaces).  However, because there is no mechanism holding these extensions into place, this means that the parent installing the gate must use two hands to hold up the gate, make sure each of the 4 separate extension brackets and two separate support bars, and the 4 metal extension bars which the brackets slide over (none of which lockinto place in anyway) don't fall off, all the while trying to tighten one tension screw at a time...  I cannot even explain to you how two limbs are not enough to get the job done and still remain sane by the end of the process.Throw me a bone Kidco!  How about the brackets clip or screw that holds the brackets into place so they don't slide off while I'm trying to mount the gate?  Something!?!Unfortunately, you will find that Kidco often makes the best products for this kind of thing but they sure do cut corners on the little stuff that would make a parent's life a LOT easier.
+1	I purchased this product used.  It was still easy to install and it is truly pressure mounted - we did not need to put holes in our walls.  We installed this at the bottom of our stairs, one step up.Pros:*This is a very sturdy gate.  My twins stand on the first step and constantly play and apply their weight.*Its fairly simple to use one handed.*The opening is plenty wide enough to walk through without having to turn sideways (and I'm not a skinny minnie)*This will probably work if I need to install in a doorway to keep toddlers in their room, and not conflict with a doorknob (just guessing).*The door can open either direction (although on the stairs that doesn't matter)Cons:I've been using this gate for at least 4 months now - I can't think of any.I bought another brand gate (a tall gate) to use in another entrance.  It is getting returned because 1.) its not truly pressure mounted, and 2.) its not sturdy like this kidco gate - I'm spoiled!  I mention this because I will go back and get another Kidco gate - I feel more comfortable knowing that it will hold up to two toddlers hanging on to it and I don't have to mar my walls.I recommend this gate and would purchase it again (even new).(I don't use this for pets, but this would be good for smaller animals or those not jumping due to the height of the gate)
+1	If you are going to invest in a baby carrier, invest in the best.  I use this carrier all the time and even my husband has started to use it and he originally said he would never put a baby in such a contraption.  It hold the baby very securly and is comfortable to wear.  Has a classy look to it and goes through the wash well.  Easy to get baby in and out of.
+1	Even before we had our baby I told my wife that I wanted this baby carrier as my first Father's Day gift. Now that baby is around, I love putting him in the carrier and taking him around, not just because I can free up both my hands, but mostly because we get to spend quality time very close together, and the movement when I walk seems to soothe him (unless he's hungry, of course!) I would recommend all dads (and moms) to consider getting their Baby Bjorn. Along with the swing, the bouncer and a few other pieces of gear, it will not only make your first few parenting weeks easier to deal with but it will reward you time and again with unforgettable moments with your baby!
+1	I got this carrier as a baby shower gift and it has been truly a great gift.  I can use it anywhere and it is pretty simple to use.  My son is now 4 mos and still fits comfortably in it.  This is a "Must Have" item.  It is kind of pricey, but worth the money since it has a 20 lb. capacity and won't just be a couple of months worth of uses.
+1	$80.00, fine.  Knowing what I know now, I would've paid $200.00.  This is the second pair of hands you need.  It is very comfortable to use, even as your baby gets heavier.  It's got the option of facing your baby outward as well and my daughter loved to look around as she got older.  I washed it and it faded a bit but I still feel the Bjorn can do no wrong. An ansolute must and a fantastic gift idea (maybe get a few people to go in on it to help if finances are a problem).
+1	I really wanted a soft carrier, and the Bjorn had great reviews...  but it's pricey.  Luckily, my mother-in-law was feeling generous with the baby gifts, and she bought us one.At first, my son hated it.  When he was little, I would put him in it, expecting him to sleep peacefully like so many other babies I had seen.  More often than not, though, he would thrash his head around and mash his face into my chest.  Boy was I glad we hadn't paid for this!But we kept trying...Once he was big enough to flip around...  he loved it!  I use this mostly when I am out and shopping, rather than putting him in his baby bucket in the cart.  He loves to be up high and look around.  Everyone remarks on what a quiet, happy baby he is.  (If they only lived with us...)No matter how much of a fusspot he is being, putting him in the Bjorn almost always makes him happy.  I keep it in the basket of my stroller when we go for walks, so if he starts wailing (as he usually does after about 2 miles) I can switch him to the Bjorn and he will be happy until we are home.He started teething early and one great thing about the Bjorn is it puts something soft and squishy right at mouth level for him to chew on.  Dealing with a baby who is teething but lacks the developmental skills to hold and use a teething toy is maddening - so this is a great little side benefit to the carrier.The first few times I wore the Bjorn, it did feel a little hard on my back.  Now I have no problems with that at all, and my baby is about 16 1/2 pounds.  (He's a big 4 1/2 month old...)I have no fears of him falling out of this thing, it holds him quite securely.  It's a little akward getting him into it when I am by myself and want him to be forward facing - but he doesn't seem to mind being flipped about and arched back over my shoulder for the little bit of time it takes.  It would be nice if there were some way transfer the baby from person to person without removing him from the Bjorn, but doing so would probably make the carrier a lot less secure.The longest I have ever walked using this carrier is about 1 1/2 miles.  Before he was born, I really thought this would be great for nice, long, arm swinging walks, but it hasn't really worked out that way.  At about that point, we both start to get a little fussy.  Also, his hands get really cold, I think because the top edge of the carrier cuts into his armpits and cuts off circulation.  I have tried adjusting the seat height, but I can't seem to find a way around this.  It doesn't happen if the top flap is fasted over his shoulders, but he likes to have his arms free and doing that restricts his arms.I haven't tried any other soft carriers to compare this to, but I did get a Maya Wrap sling.  My husband liked the sling when the baby was little, but I was never comfortable using it.  It made the baby so folded up, I was constantly checking his breathing, as well as constantly supporting his weight with my arm, which rather defeated the purpose of using the sling in the first place.  I really like how the carrier allows me to have my baby close, be arms free, yet still feel my baby is safe and supported.It would be nice if they made the regular carrier with just slightly longer straps.  This size works just fine for both my husband and I, but I really find it annoying how you have to pay so much extra for just two more inches of material if you and your spouse are very different in size.One more sort of so-so point about this is, they say you can use it for nursing, but I can't understand why you would want to.  I understand how to do it in theory, but I have never tried it and doubt I ever will.
+1	This baby carrier was the best investment I made for my sanity!  It was a lifesaver for me and my colicky baby.  I put him in it when he was fussy and I needed to get things done, or go out.  He always wanted to be carried and didn't like his travelsystem, so this was the only way I was able to take walks and move around the house with my hands free.  I also used it when we went shopping.  Lifesaver.  He is now 6 months old and he still loves it!  It is pricey, but I found it was well worth it for my sanity!
-1	I actually liked this stool for the longest time. What I love about it is the slip-resistant top and bottom. However, as my kids got older and weighed more, I find that if they if they place their weight too much to one side it does tip over. They've learned to be careful and we do still use this in their bathroom. My biggest problem with the stool is that the underside of the stool is made with a plastic grid and once my son fell on it when the stool was upside down and had to go to the hospital and get stitches in his knee. I was surprised that the plastic was able to cut him like that. Now, I know Baby Bjorn did not intend for this stool to be used upside down, but my kids are always moving this stool around to use it in different places, and sometimes they leave it upside down. These are just things to keep in mind if you purchase this stool. I obviously haven't thrown mine out, but I wouldn't buy another one & it probably should have gone into the trash after a visit to the emergency room.
+1	This is a good step stool. It helps my cautious 2 year old get into her queen size bed (no frame).
+1	This is the perfect size! It's large enough for my 3 year old to get both feet on comfortably but not so bulky that it gets in the way in the bathroom. It also has a really nice rubber top so it's not slippery as well as rubber grip on the bottom so it's not sliding around on the tile floors.
+1	We have two of these and my toddler totes them all over the house to climb up on things. Very sturdy, we are happy with the stools
+1	Ordered this product about 5 days ago. Must say that I am impressed. It is durable, sturdy and is a companion for my 2 year old. She seems to take it all around the house (even climb up the sofa from the armrest side) just to go up the sofa.It has been very easy to have the young gal adapt to using it. She gets up and gets down smoothly from her regular activities (brushing, using the toilet, etc).Highly recommend it to anyone whose child is about to be potty-trained or can wash hands or perform simple hygenic chores.
+1	This worked perfect for using the potty and for using the sink.  Also since it is a plain color it I felt it didn't stick out in the bathroom as much as an Elmo or Dora would.
+1	I use it as a stool and it's nice. won't slip on any surface. But I guess it will be hard to clean the top.
+1	Very modern looking. And my decor a good fit. I love this little bench. Expect their children to use it. Now the child is still too small.
+1	We love these at our house.  This pink one is especially cute.  The rubberized bottom never ever slips and the stepping surface is also non-slip.  They are loud when you set them down, but I would imagine any stool would be.
+1	I thought the price was a bit steep for a step stool, but man is it well made!  This step stool will not budge, with all the rubber grips it has.  It's also a lot nicer looking after it's been used a while because the black rubber on the top wears so nicely.  I looked at another step stool in the BRU store when I bought this, and its rubber already looked icky just from people testing it out.  This Baby Bjorn one is also very strong, even for heavier children.  I'm very pleased!
+1	This matches the potty I bought for my grandson.  I want to instill in him the habit of proper hand washing after toilet use right away, and having this at the sink will help.  I just wish this company had made this with two steps...one is not quite high enough for the sink we have.Even so,  I would recommend this quality product.
+1	My 2.25 year old daughter loves standing on this in the bathroom and it seems very sturdy and safe.  I wish it was a tad taller or had a step because she still can't quite reach the sink.
+1	At first I didn't like this step as it wasn't tall enough for my then 2 year old son to get to the toilet seat on his own. At nearly 3 years old, he can get up-and-down from the toilet seat on his own, but he's still not even close to reaching the faucets on the sink. However, after several near miss falls on a small, sliding two-step Rubbermaid ladder, I realized that the BabyBjorn one is a safe choice. And I like the way that it looks too and the fact that ours was made in Sweden (I believe it's now made in the USA).
+1	My toddlers are 34&#34; tall. The step is still too short for the sink.  I need to get something else until they are tall enough for this step or when they are potty trained.  Otherwise the surface is wide enough for their feet and it does feels sturdy.
+1	With four kids (the oldest being 4 yo), we have five of these throughout the house. Yes, it's most commonly used in the bathrooms for the toilet and sink but the kids also use this in our kitchen and bedrooms. In fact, we know we need more when we see them carry these around from room to room!Why do we keep buying these?-HEIGHT-Seems to be the perfect height to ensure a balance of safety and function. My 36" 4 yo can reach sink hardware easily. My 28" 2 yo can use it to reach the water in the sink.-STURDINESS-These are incredibly sturdy. After years of regular use, they still look brand new and have not deteriorated in any way. Unlike another review I read, I find it hard to tip these over. You have to try to tip them over or be very careless (if the kids don't place their entire feet on the step). These are meant for kids but can easily support me (170 lb).-SAFETY-With rubber grips on the feet, they don't move around at all on tile, hardwood, or carpet. Not only do they have rubber on the feet but the step is also rubberized. My kids have never slipped on these and they use them daily. Additionally, all corners are rounded.-DESIGN-They do not look as nice as wooden steps in my opinion but since they are plastic, they are easy to clean. All of ours are white and none of them have discolored. They look at home as part of a toddler's bathroom but look a little out of place in other rooms of the house.-RECOMMENDATION-All my kids love these, including our 18-month old climber. We continue to buy these when we need more steps. Buy and sleep well knowing you have safe, functional step that will easily outlast your child's needs.
+1	sturdy, good quality, nice design. Buyer be aware that it is kind of short, not tall enough for my 3-yr to watch her hands in the bathroom sink, , but good for getting on the toilet to potty.
+1	A great step stool for those who don't want their house to look as though it's been overtaken by kid-themed stuff. I like the non-slip rubber along the bottom to keep the stool in place, and the same rubber on top to keep the kid in place. :) Simple, cute, and durable.
+1	We keep this stool under the sink in the bathroom so our son can wash his hands. When he's taller he'll be able to use it to get to the big potty as well. It seems completely safe, it is pretty innocuous looking, and we have no complaints. He can't quite reach the faucet yet, but it gets him close enough that with a little adult help he can wash his hands "by himself" which is all we need. I am confident it will last a long time. It's light enough for him to pick up and put into position, but the rubber bottom means that he can't really drag it or kick it around without picking up -- a plus in my book, as it trains him not to just push things around when they should be picked up and carried.
+1	I looked at a few options before I choose this safe step. It is well made and very sturdy. Only the best for my grandbabies!
-1	Its probably because my baby isn't tall enough, but He can't put his feet on this thing without it sliding when he is on the toliet. The top surface is nice, but the bottom needs more slide resistance.
+1	nice product, works as described.
+1	My son used this when we transition from the potty chair to the toilet. This helped him tremendously and made the toilet more accessible.
+1	This stool has really good grips. It never budges. We use it for the potty and sink, and haven't had any slipping accidents. I would purchase this again for sure.
+1	I have two of these, one for each bathroom.  they are very stable and just the right size for a 3 and 5 year old to get a little higher to wash hands or brush teeth.
+1	My 2 yr old son likes to sit and stand on these stools. He's not quite tall enough where he can use it to reach the sink in our bathroom, but getting closer. These stools are very sturdy, even mom and dad can sit or stand on them.
+1	Overall a very good stool.  I like the gripper stuff on the top and bottom.  My two year old can also move it around easily.  It would have received 5 stars if it was a bit taller.  Even with the stool, my daughter still can't reach the sink so we use this one for other purposes.
+1	Using this for my toddler (2yo) in his bathroom. Have not noticed any difference between this product and cheaper step stools. It is sturdy, nice-looking and serves the purpose - even though for some people it makes sense to buy a cheaper one.
+1	We began by using this in the bathroom while potty training my son but now it travels all over the house. He carries it to the kitchen sink to wash his hands, help cook or bake and work on projects in the garage. I love that it is small and light enough for him to carry and still so useful!
+1	This is a great little stool.  We also purchased the matching toilet seat trainer for our three year old.  This stool works great in the bathroom for brushing teeth or climbing onto potty.  It has an attractive design and a non-slip grip on the bottom so there's no risk for falls.  I recommend this item.
+1	This thing is light weight, easy to grab and move with a grippy top. The drawback to the grippy top is that it grips to the billion things kids trek around so it perpetually has something stuck to it. Probably cleans up nicely, but after cleaning the kids and the kitchen and a billion other things, the stool is at the bottom of my list and just stays dirty.
+1	This is the second baby bjorn step stool we have purchased. It is simple, it works well, no moving parts for my baby to get into while crawling, and allows my daughter to wash her hands by herself. Wonderful.
+1	I purchased 2 of these, one for my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law's home as they are beginning the potty-training task with our grandson.  Although he is still too young to be able to handle climbing on this by himself, having it around the home now will get him familiar with the item and what its use is for.  I purchased all of the potty training items now for both homes so our grandson will become comfortable with them at both homes and learn what he needs to do at both homes too.  This step is very well made, sturdy, and doesn't have any sharp edges to hurt the little ones.  The top is slip-proof and has a rubber strip on the bottom to keep it from slipping on tile and wood floors as well.  Highly recommend.
+1	Great step stool for my two year old to use to wash his hand all by himself.  The non slip service works great!
+1	It helps my daughter get on the BABYBJORN potty seat, reach the sink for hand washing and teeth brusing.  Overall we like it!
+1	I was wanting something small and sturdy and this fits the bill! Some of the ones you find at Target that are plastic are very flimsy. This has rubber on the footings and on the top and is exactly what I was looking for.
+1	We have 3 of these, and could probably use a couple more.  These are the easiest stools for my daughter to use.  She climbs up and down the potty herself on it easily since it is so stable.  She can also easily retrieve it and put it somewhere when she needs a little step up.  I wish there was a taller size of this so we could use at the sink (she's too short to reach with just this stool at the sink).  And in the early potty training days she wasn't tall enough to reach the toilet with this either, so I think a taller size would just be really useful.  But regardless, this is a good reliable stool to have and looks nice.  I find baby bjorn products to generally be very good.
+1	I read a lot of the other lower reviews about it being over priced, it's just a step stool or the grip is bad or it tips over...........Did you buy the same product?This is a clean looking great stool with good traction and easy to use for little onesIt's a trusted brand which I would highly recommendWhen you pay a little more you get better quality
+1	Bought this to match the Babybjorn potty seat. It is sturdy for my 19 month old, and is a good size for our small bathroom. Perfect, just like the potty!
+1	My toddler is 20 months old but is quite tall for his age and has begun using this to try and reach the sink to wash his hands.  This item stows away nicely, is sturdy yet lightweight and attractive enough.  The advantage for it is that your toddler can easily step on to it on their own.  Note that this could also be a disadvantage as an unattended to child could be standing on top in a heartbeat when not wanted.  So, be careful what the access to this item looks like.  The disadvantage of that height is that my 20 month old can't even come close to actually putting his hands under the faucet to wash his hands and I still need to hold him.My recommendation is to know what you are using this for and understand the dimensions of this item combined with the height of your child and about how far they can reach.  If it doesn't help you to just get a little but higher-maybe hold off.  If your child is tall enough to benefit from the Safe Step-this is a reasonable value for a safe, sturdy item that will not slide around on the ground or break easily.
+1	This is such a great stool! It's sturdy and doesn't slide around. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that my two-and-a-half year old is a little on the small side, so this stool would be more helpful to us if it were about 2 inches or so taller. Other than that it's great!
-1	Got this for our first child (read: bought into the idea of buying the whole BabyBjorn potty training line to match).  It's only 6 inches tall so it's your basic step stool.  Obviously the product description already says that so that wasn't a suprise.  However, my son is 20 months, 95 percentile for height.  When the faucet in the bathroom is on full-blast, this stool only allows him to get the tips of his fingers wet so I still have to pick him up to wash his hands.  This doesn't allow him to get on the "adult" toilet by himself nor can his feet touch when he's sitting on the adult toilet (which: (a) is bad for assisting him w/ #2 since it's better for him to plant his feet and "brace himself" rather than dangling his legs; and (b) this requires me to hold him still while he's sitting on the potty so he doesn't fall backwards or forwards).If you want a basic step stool there are cheaper ones out there that are just as good.If you have a young child, this isn't the best option.  Try a 2-step stool, such as the rubbermaid version, instead.  For kids 4 and over this is probably fine, my nephew is close to 4 and this would probably work for him.
+1	This step stool is the perfect size!  Bought it for our 2 year old and he is able to carry it from bedside to bathroom with no problems.  It is very sturdy and has no sharp edges.  Great, simple product!
+1	This is a nice little stool. It's not very high, so I think it would be difficult for a child to really hurt themselves fooling around on this. At the same time, it's high enough to help a toddler get up on the couch or to the toilet.It has a nice rubberized top to prevent slipping, which is great when you have a little billy goat climbing up and down repeatedly or exploring its uses in unorthodox ways. The green color is also very bright and fun, and the plastic shell seems easy to clean.
+1	My son loves being able to use this. It's easy for him to move around the kitchen to watch me while I'm cooking. I used it once (hoping I wouldn't break it) and it seems to hold 250 lbs. well. Granted, I wasn't jumping on it or anything, but it held up and didn't break. Woo! :)
+1	i use this cuz my baby is too short but already active and wants to bounce/etc. so i use this under his feet. later it can be used for potty training, and it is also a step stool in the kitchen area for the shelves that a just a little too high for me. love this, use it all the time for everything. does slide on my bamboo hardwood floors tho, the antislip doesnt work perfectly with smaller weights like a baby.
+1	Love this product! My favorite feature is the non-slip material on the feet and on top. It doesn't slide around when my kids climb up and down which was a big concern for me. My kids love it and so do I!
+1	I like this step stool a lot. It's very sturdy & looks nice too. My 2 year old son stands on it just fine & the non-slip top is fabulous.
+1	These cups have been perfect for my 1-year old son. I've tried just about every brand on the market & had issues with them all - they were either too small (didn't hold enough liquid), had parts that dislodged, leaked and/or started to "fray" at the spout when my son used/chewed them. Not these - they are a larger size than most, very durable, don't leak at all & were very easy for my son use. Highly recommend!
+1	Great lid.  Our little one has no trouble getting liquid out and can hold the cup on her own.  Great product.
+1	First off, the ad that I saw which I purchased from told me I was getting blue and orange cups, I received mint green/pink and purple/pink.  I wasn't happy since the bottles are for my son.  That said, I did use them and like them.  The material is a sturdy plastic  that wears well after multiple washes and being thrown on every hard surface imaginable.  I also like the little plastic piece that goes inside the bottle preventing leaks when traveling.  It works.  My only complaint is that the sippy piece is a little hard.  I know it is meant for teething babies but I worry that when he chews on it it might hurt his teeth, it is that hard.
+1	I read wonderful things about these online, so I went out and got them.  My daughter loves them!  We've got them on her car seat/carrier, and they keep her entertained while we shop, eat out, whatever.  She has managed to stay interested in them for a long time!  Great product!
+1	I switched these from the basinette, to the infant carrier to the stroller all the time.Really cute how my son would focus on them.
+1	These are great! My baby girl has loved these since she was just a few weeks old (she's almost 6 months now & still loves them.) At first, I'd place them on the sides of the car seat handle, so they'd catch her peripheral vision. It's been fun seeing her develop & her enjoyment of these little bugs just keeps developing, too. First she just watched them, then she batted at them, now she grabs & pulls & of course, tries to eat them. Only problem is that the jitter toy (the firefly) broke a long time ago, before she even got to the point where she could pull it & enjoy it. Still, she doesn't know she's missing anything.
+1	Makes any car ride, just that much more quieter :)
+1	My son loved these hanging on his infant carseat.  Now I put them on his wrists when he is in a shopping cart.  They not only keep him busy but I dont have to worry about him dropping them.
+1	I don't know what I would have done without these bugs.  They kept my daughter entertained for hours while she was in her infant carseat.  Now that she is in the larger carseat I have found other places to attach them because they are her favorite travelling toy.  This is one toy that I will be saving for her memory box!
+1	When I bought these bugs for my 2 months old boy I anticipated him to get attracted; but his reaction exceeded all my expectations. When he saw these toys hanging on his bouncer he said his first "Wow!" :-) Or, whatever he said, definitely meant a big Wow. I had never seen him that excited before. My little man was even more attracted when he discovered that the bugs have crunchy wings, they rattle and the dragonfly buzzes. Toys came in different colors then shown on the picture; but they look even nicer.  The size is perfect also: enough to attract an infant's attention, but not too big so he can hold them easily. He can spend 30 minutes or even more kicking these toys, touching wings and even talking to them! The bugs became his best friends - and mine too because, while he is busy with them in his bouncer or crib, I can spare time for some homework.
+1	When we reg for our twins i think we totaly forgot about cute practical things like these. My friend bought us 4 sets of these cute little bugs. To keep on both sets of infant carseats My babies really like them and im so happy she got them for us. We put these on when the babies were about 2 weeks old and now at almost 6 months they still love to stare at them. Sometimes when we run earns i just take one down and give them to the babies to chew on, shake, or rattle around with. They get a lot of mouth time now since they are teething. I have washed them a few times already just cuz we spent time some at other ppls homes and their children were chewing and carrying around with the bugs quit a bit. I just wash them in the sink with cold water and woolite and let them air dry. They still are in great shape. They come in great for those long car rides to visit family. Each of the bugs do something diffrent. All around this is a great product!
+1	My son wasn't interested in these until he was maybe 3 or so months old, but then he loved them. He's 8 months old now and we bring them when we go shopping or out to eat. I just velcro one on to his wrist or the stroller or highchair and I never have to worry about him dropping his rattle or toy on the nasty floor wherever we go!
+1	great toy, works well on place flights.  occupies child and keeps them happy.
+1	to be honest i did not use it , but believe it is a very good product for those who travel :)!!!
+1	This is excellent!  I pump in my car while at work and this is the BEST idea ever.  Nice long cord allows you to pump in the backseat for privacy.  A must have!
+1	If you do your pumping outside of an office, like I do, you'll find that pumping in the car can be quite enjoyable. You have climate control, your favorite kind of music, and you can even park under a tree or somewhere else if you have time. This car adapter makes it possible!
+1	Very necessary and helpful part, would definitely recommend adding to your pumping bag if you're a working mom or find yourself traveling often.  Having this product increased my pumping options and was definitely worth the small investment of cost.
+1	Nice piece of equipment. Make the pumping experience way better. Mobility means a lot when you need to pump regularly but don't want to stay home all the time.
+1	If you need to pump in the car for any reason:Working full-time, during lunch.Long trips (vacation) during the summer.Privacy.Asking someone to drive, while you pump in the back (cord long enough).:)
+1	Works great- has same power as a wall charger if not better! Big fan with my hour commute to work or for family car trips to family- pump and drive and more time with daddy and baby when I walk in the door at home
+1	Works great!  Used it on a 5 hour road trip. Need to pump every 3-4 hours. No problems, very convenient, works great!
+1	Good price for such a convenience!  Driving down the road with your breast pump attached is one of the biggest joys in life!  :/Thanks for making it possible!No problems with this product.  Works perfectly!
-1	This product great while it worked, but within a month of using it, the metal part of the adapter broke off and I have been unable to use it since.  I used it maybe 4-6 times in that first month - not sure why the metal is so flimsy.
+1	I am sure it works fine but just think about buying it before you do. If you are like me, as soon as you were pregnant you ordered absolutely everything you would possibly need. I do pump and exclusively breastfeed but I now realize I really don't think there is ever a time where I would need to pump in the car!
+1	I chuckled the first time I saw this car adapter but after reading reviews I thought that this might be something that would really make my life easier.  I decided to purchase before going on a road trip and I am glad that I did.  I was going to give up on pumping when I went back to work but my hour commute each way will be the perfect time to pump at least two times a day without it interfering with my workload.  While the thought of pumping while driving seemed silly, I tried it today and it was completely safe and inconspicuos with my hands-free pumping bra under my shirt.  I am very glad that I bought this as it has an even stronger charge than my plug in adapter.  I do recommend this to any working mom who might think of giving up on pumping.  Be hands free and it is a great idea.
+1	Keep in mind that this adapter is not for new Medela pumps. I don't recall what year the cut off is for this adapter, but you should research that before purchasing. The cord length is great: would have easily spaned the length of my vehicle. The speed of the pump is faster using the adapter vs. the regular electric cord, so I just used a slower speed when I pumped. No complaints at all.
+1	These seem to be working. I started using them a month prior to my due date in preparation for breast feeding. I haven't had the baby yet, so I will find out once she's here if they did what they're supposed to!
+1	I was given some of these at the hospital when I delivered my baby as we were having major latch issues.  They worked so well that now we are exclusively breast feeding and no longer need to pump and use the bottle two weeks later, or one of those annoying nipple shields.  My only problem was that if I didn't wear them e.g. at night as Medela suggests then the nipples would get flat again, so I purchased an extra set and wear them all the time.  Wearing them 24/7 did cause some irritation initially but breast milk solves everything, and I make sure to air the area out after every feeding and keep them clean and now this is not a problem.  I hope with longer use I won't have to wear them all the time.  I also find that as long as I don't wear anything low cut then nobody would know I was wearing them, I am not on the huge side so I don't know if that makes a difference.  As an additional bonus they are a built in catch for leaking milk.ETA: at 6 weeks pp I no longer need to wear the shells so much, they have done their job and now I am wearing them for maybe 8 hours per day. Still love them!
+1	Due to having inverted nipples and not really knowing how to help that (the nurses and LC at the hospital weren't much help to me at all), I didn't do too well with breastfeeding my first child and gave up after only about 1 wk which made me feel like a total FAILURE. Heck, I didn't even know I had inverted nipples until the nurses told me!I got pregnant again and really wanted to give breastfeeding another try this time around so I began researching as much as possible to find out what I can do without using those nipple sheilds they give you at the hospital. I found a blog site talking about how these helped a women in my situation so I ordered them from here. They arrived very quickly and were a great price. I started to use them when I was around 8 months pregnant. Since I have been using them they have made a considerable change to the shape of my nipples. They aren't inverted like they used to be! The cups are very comfortable to wear as well. They do make a weird shape in your bra so I wouldn't be running errands or anything in them but I wear them while I'm doing housework and you can barely feel that you are wearing them.I now feel like breastfeeding will be a much better success this time around because of these cups.(And from all the other information I have learned since the last time around)
+1	This is my first baby and I got very sore and cracked nipples from breastfeeding him.  I tried just about everything to help heal them.  Using these with A&D; Original Ointment Tube for Diaper Rash & All-Purpose Skincare Formula - 1.5 Oz between nursings, and pumping for two days with only nursing a few times, was the only thing that worked to heal my severely cracked nips.  (If you do this, wipe off the A+D before breastfeeding/pumping as it can be harmful if ingested by baby.)I wouldn't recommend them for leaking.  They seem to make me leak more, as I rarely leak when not using these.  They also will soak your clothes if you don't empty them VERY often, and then bend over to pick something up!  I can see them being useful for collecting milk while breastfeeding.They are larger than I imagined them being, but they aren't very noticeable if you wear a padded bra.
+1	I rarely will buy anything without looking at reviews.  This works fine at protecting me even with some of the issues I had prior to giving birth.
+1	my girlfriend complained of her nipples being sore from breast feeding and these had great reviews so i got them.she loved them, they dont touch ur nipple to aggravate it yet still catches any leakage
+1	I was almost ready to give up breastfeeding and resort to full-time pumping before I tried these. My nipples were extremely sore, raw, and tender, and I would tear up whenever my son latched on. It was ruining the whole breastfeeding experience for me, and I felt so guilty! I got these SoftShells and within a few days my nipples felt a million times better. They keep the nipple erect, which helps with latching, and the air-circulation has healed the cracks and raw areas. They are a little awkward to get used to at first (think of wearing a 'cup' on your boobs), but I find that they are pretty discreet under my clothes, especially when worn with a nursing bra/top. My only complaint is that the cups can fill up sometimes (if you have a let down between feedings), and if you're not careful you can leak out when you bend over or to the side, even with the foam inserts. So be sure to check them, like whenever you go to the restroom. Its amazing how much milk can collect in them... Small inconvenience compared to how beneficial these SoftShells are!! Don't give up on breastfeeding ladies!
+1	My nipples were extremely painful in the first few weeks.  My breasts were too large for my daughter to handle for the first 2-3 weeks, so I was pumping every two hours.  Needless to say this wore my nipples out very quickly.  These shells - which my mother (a lactation consultant) suggested - were a lifesaver.  Allowing my nipples to air dry helped them heal and provided relief from the friction of a bra or nursing pad.  HOWEVER, they also encourage excretion from the nipples and, thus, would fill up pretty quickly.  If you didn't feed/pump frequently and/or check on them often, there was often a good chance that they would overflow, or be so full that the slightest leaning forward would cause them to spill.  I think they would work better if you could find a material more absorbant than the foam inserts provided.  Once you are aware of the problem, though, it's easily managed.  Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.
+1	I bought these when my daughter was in the nicu and I was exclusively pumping for her. I had Raw, cracked, and sometimes bleeding nipples from it. These were a godsend. I actually just passed them off to my best friend who just had her baby and was having similar issues (is that gross? Oh well).
+1	Can't recommend this enough.I had a horrible case of thrush. This was the only thing that helped me honestly.
+1	My son was 9 months old and we took a 2 hour flight to visit my inlaws. Since he was on my lap I wanted something to secure him since he was not buckled in.I read that some flight attendants will make you take this off during take off and landing. They let me keep it on my son and didn't say anything during our flights (they probably didn't notice).I would suggest putting the vest on before you get on the plane. It is so cramped on the plane and it made it a little tricky to get the vest on him. I was afraid they would see it and make me take it off of him. You can always put on a zip up sweater over the vest.The vest is very soft and easy to use and wash.I was thankful that I got it because when we were about to land at our destination, the pilot had to pull the plane back up. There was wind shear while we were landing and if you don't pull the plane back up, you can crash (great huh). So there is an alarm that goes off in the cockpit. It was very scary since we were ready to land and then all of a sudden we are going right back into the sky. It was very very bumpy.I didn't lose my grip on my son, but if we didn't pull back up, who knows,, I could have.bottom line: it is woth the peace of mind.
+1	i bought it for my daughter for a night flight & it was good for my piece of mind, but i didn't even use it on the day flight back, because she was moving around so much that it would have just made her mad to be strapped to me..good for the night flight though since she slept so much..but i still didn't sleep at all really...
+1	Was exactly what I was looking for. Worked well. Quilted vest was a little heavy, though. The baby had on a blanket sleeper so I wouldn't have to worry about lost socks or shoes on the way. He got pretty hot with the sleeper and the vest on before the plane took off since the air wasn't flowing well and we were all packed in tight.
+1	I like it, it kept him secure... except when the strap slid along the seatbelt and unfastned it. This is more a flaw with the design of airplane seatbelts then the vest though.
-1	This was not very useful for us.  We ended up nursing baby throughout our flight (nursing is recommended since this helps with baby's ears' popping), and the strap on this flight vest is not long enough for baby to lie on my knees while i nurse her.  So that meant we didn't use this vest at all!
+1	C&oacute;moda
+1	I really wish I'd bought these before the birth. I got them a few months into breast feeding and loved them. They are really best for wearing in the privacy of your home as they will be visible unless you're wearing a bulky sweater. However if you are at all interested in reserving every last drop of precious breast milk you will appreciate these! Also, for soar nipples they provide a little relief.The fit in the bra and a hole around the nipple allows leakage to flow undaunted, I found that the fit was good and everything leaked in the reservoir as designed. Wearing them around during the day helped me collect an extra ounce and a half of milk (foremilk, but still good stuff - hydration is essential!) that would otherwise have been wasted into my clothing.
+1	This is very useful for collecting milk on other breast while breastfeeding. Comfortable and used all the time. Good product.
-1	BOUGHT THESES FOR MY DAUGHTER IN LAW AND SHE SAID THAT THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO USE THEM
+1	i was not fully awake (caring for a newborn and all) when i ordered these and thought i was ordering extra breast cushions for my pump (which would be nice) so clearly i did not read carefully and was surprised by what i got. However, i am thrilled because i also was looking for something like this (a different name was recommended) and these work great. when i pump or nurse i leak on the other side. When nursing i would soak myself and my daughter and pumping was not much better, at least my little girl wouldn't be soaked. :-) using these i typically catch an ounce in them which is worth so much to me. my daughter doesn't seem to notice that she isn't getting soaked, she didn't seem to care before but i sure did.i'm so happy with them that i came back to order an extra set for my emergency pump kit for the car.i do enjoy saying its my best accidental purchase so far :-)-Traci (using shared hubbys account)
+1	These are the best inventions for breastfeeding moms!When I first started breastfeeding, milk would leak like crazy on the other side I always thought it would have been nice if someone design something to catch the leak so the milk doesn't go to waste. Then I found these and they work amazingly! I remember I was able to save 1 oz of milk during 1 feeding session.When I am engorged in pain at night, say 4am, and my baby didn't wake up to feed, I no longer have to go wide awake and wonder if I should get up and pump. (and that is not an easy decision because I'd hear my baby cry every time AFTER I finished pumping!) Nowadays I would get up and put these shells in and go back to sleep. Milk would leak out from my nipples and give me some relieve so I can continue to sleep. The only problem is because the plastic doesn't mold perfectly over your breasts, milk would sometimes leak out on the edges/sides instead of letting the cup catch it. I'd try to lay in a position that milk won't leak out on the edges. But even if it leaks, these are still lifesaver because at least I won't be in pain anymore and am able to get some rest until my baby cries.I wish I knew about these when I was still pregnant - I dealt with crazy engorgement pain when my milk first came in. I was crying when calling the lactation hotlines. Back then I was in so much pain and was so sleep deprived that I could not process any advice. I wonder what it would have been like if I had these shells back then!Overall I highly recommend this product!
+1	I use these in the morning with the first feeding because I leak on whatever side my daughter is not nursing from.  I use them more so the milk doesn't go to waste than to protect my clothing.  If I used them for protection of clothing or for sore nipples I would not have rated them as high as I did.  First, they are not made for really large breasts.  They set nicely over the nipple, but certainly do not cover much more than the areola area.  If I were to wear these out, my breasts would look like large mushrooms.  They are nice in the privacy of my own home, though.  The shell that fits on the breast is comfortable.  It is easy to clean and soft.  I would recommend these for the use of collecting leaking milk while pumping and feeding only.  I would not recommend these to wear out when you are going to miss a feeding and know you will leak.  Wear disposable pads.  Also, I wouldn't recommend them for the sore nipple problem either if you are large breasted.
+1	This is one of the essential products for every mom. I used it only for 1 month though, during the time my nipples were sore.It was a sanity saver.
-1	I used these only to remain dry while my baby was nursing the other side. I reach for the nurse-dri shells that I received for free in the hospital first. These are big and bulky and I hate the design of them compared to other shells. I only reach these when my other shells are dirty. Plus i hate that they only recommend these for a certain length of time.
+1	My wife gets a lot of milk leaking from side A when she feeds from side B. We bought these and some O-cal-ette nursing cups at the same time. These are in my view far superior in design to the O-cal-ette (which has a hole where the milk will leak out), because they have no hole for the leak to milk out, well actually they come with two cups, one with holes, one without, and we use the one without. Great. Also they're apparently comfortable enough to put on while feeding.However!These are not 5 star because... they don't hold enough milk! So we are still wondering if we can find such a product which will fit inside a bra in similar way, but passively collect a larger amount of breastmilk.
+1	These are great and help protect my sore and cracked nipples. Just don't bump into anything while wearing them...ouch!  But I prefer the hard shell to insure my sore nipples are protected.  You can't wear these out with a regular bra because they give you a weird shape.  I wear them to work with my contoured t-shirt bra and you can't tell I'm wearing them.  My breasts look bigger, but there is no weired shape with the contoured bra. I wear them with my nursing bra when at home.
+1	You absolutely cannot wear these out in public!  This is for home use only!  They do not match the contour of the breast at all so there's a totally weird bulge on your boob when you wear them.  So with that being said, if you do just wear these at home, they can be great!  If you have really raw nipples they offer a much needed relief and the ability to get air.  I use them at night so that they catch anything that I leak, and I can then just pour the milk into the baby's mouth via a little spout on the edge.  I find that I go the longest without nursing through the night, so this offers a great way to never waste a drop!
+1	I use these at night time since my little girl decides to sleep about a 6 hour stretch at night. I sleep with them on, and they don't move around. The only problem is that sometimes the milk gets between the silicone and the hard plastic which sometimes causes it to leak and I then wake up with a big mess. It has only happened a couple times though and I use them every day. I also wear them during the day when my nipples get worn out from feeding, helps the pain!
-1	I bought these hoping to have a nice alternative to losing the milk that escapes when I become too full but these are definitely not the product for me.  There is no way to hide these things, they are hard plastic and very apparent.
+1	Finally relief for my poor boobs! As a mom who breastfeeds it can be tough when your nipples are sore or cracked. These provide relief from your bra or breast pad rubbing and allows air to get to your nipple to allow it to heal. I put nipple cream on my sore nipples and then wear these breast shields to get a break! Definitely a must if you are breastfeeding!
-1	It made my breasts look funny, it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts. Hardly ever used it. :(
+1	I bought these for my wife when her nipples hurt from breastfeeding. They protected her nips from further pain. I am sure glad I have no need for them. But new moms that are breastfeeding will likely benefit from this nipple armor. Hope this review helps.
+1	After I gave birth, my nipples cracked and bled, I was in terrible pain. Using the ventilated shell my breasts could breath and it allowed the product I used (Lansinoh LanolinB005MI648Cto stay on as long as possible, accelerating healing process.The only thing is to watch out when bending over, the collect milk WILL spill! ;) I had many accidents like this.Going out wearing the shells can be weird, as they give a Madonna look to your breasts.This product really helped me and I highly recommend it for breastfeeding moms!
+1	My nips were sooo sore and cracked the first weeks after having my baby. These shields saved my life because I was able to put them on and walk around the house without rubbing against my clothes. You can't go outside in public with these, they poke out too much. But they are a good alternative to walking around topless. It's also great that they catch the milk. I was able to freeze and store a lot of the milk that collected in one side while nursing on the other.
+1	I use these at night when I nurse to catch the let-down on the side baby is not eating from.  It's a great way to build up a little extra for bottle feedings.  I hate wasting precious breastmilk!
-1	I bought this for the leak side when I stay home, but  the shape is weird, doesn't stay on breast very well. It's hard shell, not soft one that I hoped. when I put on with bra, feels hot; when took it off, the milk  still spill out, lost the purpose.I will not recommend this, disposable pads works better.
+1	These were a huge help getting started on my first baby. I bought them on a whim and boy was a glad. They help get my milk started because they apply a light pressure which also helps extent the nipple. They keep things (such as a bra) from rubbing against very very sore nipples. Another great feature is the air vents at the top of the cups. They are there to get air to nipple, (you don't want them getting dried out, that just makes the pain of feeding much worse). Determined breastfeeding mom's these are fantastic until your milk supply comes in at a steady pace.They do not look flattering under a TIGHT fitting shirt (loose is always best anyways) but what does when you are breastfeeding for the first few months as things are adjusting. I felt that they looked better that two huge wet spots from leakage.
+1	The Bjorn is worth every penny!I purchased my Baby Bjorn when my son was two months old, and used it on a daily basis until he was four months old (my son went to work with me for two months).  It is much easier on the back than the Snugli carrier is - I still carry my 10-month-old, 21-pound son in our Bjorn at least once a week.I love it because it keeps my hands free, and my son starts giggling and babbling every time he sees it because he enjoys riding in it so much.  (I have to confess, there have been a couple of times when I gave it to him to play with because I needed to get some baby-free stuff done!)  I never worry about dropping him when he is in the Bjorn.Our Bjorn has been through the washer and dryer several times and is only showing a little color fading.  I would recommend unhooking the straps from the carrier before throwing it all in the wash - they can get really tangled together.
+1	This carrier is great.  My daughter seems to be very comfy in it.  I used it from her first week of life.  If she was fussy I would carry her facing me and she'd be asleep within about 3 minutes of me walking around with her.  Now she is 4 months old and I carry her facing out.  She loves to look at everything and everyone and I like having her in it so that people don't try to take her from me - she has stranger anxiety :)
+1	This product is well designed, and easy to use. I felt my baby was very secure in this. Living in a metropolitan area, I rely heavily on the subway system. Putting my baby in this carrier, made traveling in the city a lot easier. You don't have to lug around car seats and strollers (on top of everything else you have to bring). I used this product for the first 3 months. My baby would nap in it, while I ran errands. But after 3 months, when my son weighed about 15 lbs., it became uncomfortable for me to carry him in this. Just too heavy. It was fine for my husband, though. This is a nice item to have, as long as you know that you'll probably only be using it for the first few months. It's pricey, so try to borrow one from a friend,(as long as the carrier is not more than 2 or 3 years old) if you can.
+1	This carrier is the best there is. You get what you pay for, and what you get is:fit--adjusts to fit both me at 5'4" and my hubby at 6'comfort--soft and padded all overease--lightweight, compact, washes easily, packs neatlysafety--well designed to hold a wiggly, heavy babyconvenience--easy to put on and put baby indurability--we've worn and washed this plenty and it's just fineOur baby has loved it since we first strapped him in at 1 1/2 months old; he's 5 months now and loves it just as much. Baby now faces out, watching people and things go by. It does get a bit hot in summer, so dress baby appropriately in a t-shirt or onesie (no jackets or sweaters or jeans). I haven't noiced him getting any hotter than if I carried him around in the car seat/carrier for the same length of time.To put it on and baby inside when you are alone, simply put baby on his back on a bed, then put on the carrier, leaving both sides unclipped and unsnapped; lean over, slide him in, then clip and snap one side; stand up while supporting baby with one hand. Then just snap and clip the other side and you're off. Do this in reverse to take him out at the end, then you don't need two people to do it, as some reviewers have claimed.
+1	I am so glad I registered for the Baby Bjorn carrier.  It is so simple to use and my baby always falls asleep in it (she's 6 weeks old).  When I first put her in it at about 2 weeks old, she didn't like it.  But I tried it again with her at about 3 weeks and she loves it.  (So if you have a baby who fusses at it, avoid it for a few days and try it again for brief periods to get the baby used to it.)  I like to go shopping with her in it so that my hands are free.  You won't be disappointed.
+1	When I purchased the Bjorn, I too had visions of long happy walks with my baby right up against me.  Well, that wasn't the case - at least not in the beginning.  My newborn hated it.  He was uncomfortable with the forward facing position and didn't like that he couldn't see out the sides.  I felt I was smothering him in there.  When he was 3 months I tried it again with the front facing position and his arms through the holes.  He liked it better, but could only stand about 10 minutes.  When I took it off I had such extreme back pain I immediately took 2 Alleves - something I never do.  Well, he's a high maintainence guy, so I figured I would give it one more try.  I readjusted everything, and when he was four months I put him in it again.  This time no arm holes.  This was much better for both of us.  I was able to get him in and out much quicker without all the extra arm and leg buttons to do.  He liked having his arms free and looking out.  It was still hard on the back, but I concentrated on keeping my knees bent and a bit of a "pelvic tilt."  We did 20 minutes a day for 3 days in a row.  It sounds kind of like more work than it's worth, but it really isn't that bad.  After that we were pros.  I now take him everywhere in it.  I have worn it for 2 hours at a time and walked a 5 mile hike in it.  He often just falls asleep in it (and he's a tough sleeper).  He's a big baby - 19 lbs. - I know I can use it until 25 lbs, but honestly I'm not sure if I'll want to at that size! He seems to be busting out of it already.  I may try the hip sling - but for now he likes it much better than the over the shoulder type sling and it gives me some hands-free time.  I always feel he is secure - even if I'm dancing around or moving quickly.  Great for the mall, ball games and walks.
+1	My son liked this carrier so much he would even fall asleep while in it. I liked it too because it would calm him down when he got fussy and it made carrying him much easier.I think it is tricky to get on and off though - takes a little practice. Some comment that baby "hangs from their crotch" - my baby loved it. I did not have him in it for more that 1/2 hour though. I only use it for 15 min. now that my baby is 20 lbs - too heavy for my back.
+1	This carrier saved me from going crazy!  My son, now 4 months old, HATES his carseat.  I couldn't take him out and have him in the infant carrier because he would just cry the whole time, no matter where we were.  The Bjorn was the perfect answer.  Even when he was only a few weeks old, he would happily ride in the front carrier for hours.  Facing in, it kept him close and kept his head steady when he couldn't do it on his own.  Now he rides facing out and loves watching people and watching what I'm doing.  Best of all, it's easy to get on and easy to get the baby settled into, even without any help.UPDATE: At 6 months and over 20 pounds, my son still loves the Bjorn and it's still totally comfortable to wear.  I only have one warning...be very aware of where your baby's hands are.  My son loves to grab things on grocery store shelves. :)Trust me....spend the extra money, you'll be happy in the long run.
+1	This infant carrier is great. I was able to start using it as soon as my baby was born because he weighed over 8 pounds. It is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. I mastered getting the baby in and out both awake and asleep after a couple of days which is great because he falls asleep in it almost every time. I am able to carry him comfortably for as much as 2 hours and he weighs over 12 pounds (I'm only 5'2".) He does get very warm in it, so I only use it for short periods of time when it is hot. I like that I can go into small shops or the park without taking a bulky infant car seat. It is great for when I have to shop alone, because I don't have to worry about putting his infant car seat into a shopping cart, which gives me extra room for purchases. It is also great for keeping others from touching your baby when you don't want them to. It is very durable and washes well, which comes in handy for spit up and diaper leaks. Even though it is a bit pricey, I feel I will get my money's worth because I plan on using it for more than one child and I know it will last long enough to do so.
+1	I didn't use this much because my baby cried most of the time when I put her in the carrier.  I used it a few times when I had to push my mom in the wheelchair and carry my baby at the same time because I had no other alternative to carry my baby.  She liked it a few times when she was a little older and could face outward.  I really didn't find much use for it, though.  Maybe our next baby will like it more.  Our first was a little fussy in her first 5 months or so.
+1	I just love carrying the baby around in my Baby Bjorn. It soothes the baby when he sleeps. I can take him out in cold weather and feel his body heat against my sweater while covering him under my coat.
+1	I really liked this carrier, however, unless you plan on using it ALOT when the baby is small, you won't get your money's worth.  My son was too big for this by 3 months.  By the time I decided to take him out of the house, he barely fit in it.  It might be a better idea to get a cheaper carrier.
+1	This is a great carrier that is well worth the extra money it costs.  It is extremely user-friendly.  You don't have to have 5 arms or be a contortionist to use it like you do with some of the cheaper carriers.  You can wear this carrier with the baby facing you or facing out.  However, it cannot be worn on your back like some carriers can.  My son loves this carrier.  I generally wear him in it around the house when I am trying to get things done and for short outings.  If I am going to be out for a while, I usually put him in the stroller b/c I find that to be more convenient.  My only problem is that now that he is almost 20 pounds it really weighs down on my shoulders and if I carry him in it for too long I am really sore.  However, it doesn't seem to bother my husband as much.  I had to wash it recently for the first time b/c my son spit up all over it and it held up great in the wash.  It is a very stylish, sturdy carrier that couldn't be easier to use.  It is an excellent choice.
+1	I hate to use that as my title cause you hear it all the time BUT I swear I have tried just about all of them and this one is by far my favorite... Honestly everything is going to give you a little back pain after awhile... heck my purse alone does... But this Bjorn distributes the weight and pressure of the baby that you honestly will be thrilled with the carrier. I have tried all of the little cheap ones and I figured I was saving money but not I have a carrier collection and only use my bjorn. So Honestly Save money by purchasing just one.My son loved me holding him when he was little and when he got  interested in looking around I just flipped him around and he had the comforts of mom but yet could see everyone else.. And I had the use of my two arms... :-)
+1	This is definitely the best carrier on the market. It gives the best support for me and my daughter loves it. It is also helpful that the carrier comes in adult colors. Sometimes you want to look like a grownup instead of always wearing pastels or items with cartoon animals on it : ) I have tried other carriers and this is by far the highest quality on the market. It is worth the extra money.
+1	This carrier is the best!  We are on child #5 and have had a carrier for each one and the last one is definately the best!  I researched and considered carefully before purchasing this and all reviews and reports were accurate.The ease of use is remarkable.  I can get baby in and out all by myself.  From the day after Luca and I arrived home from the hospital, we were out for our daily walks.  I sing in our church choir every Sunday and Luca is in his Bjorn close to me and we have never missed a Mass!  It is always in the diaper bag when we shop because he ultimately ends up in his carrier.  Even at age 9 months we use it often!  Now he sits forward in it and charms all he sees!Unfortunately I have yet to figure out how to nurse baby when in this.  I do recall reading that you could but I have tried and find it impossible, at least for me.You put your arms through the straps and the front of the carrier is open, you then take the front piece and snap it on (very easy) You can then place your baby on you and hold him/her with one arm and pick up the front of the carrier and bring it up over baby sliding the built in post-like fasteners into their respective color coded openings on the straps.  Baby is safe secure and mom/dad has 2 free hands!Great great product!
+1	This carrier far outshines the Snugli I tried first.  The Baby Bjorn is much more lightweight and better designed.  You can load baby in easily and there are no buckles in the back to worry about.  Adjustments are easy to make, both for your comfort and baby's.  My five month old daughter loves it for facing out when she's awake and alert, and when she gets sleepy I can quickly turn her facing in and she usually goes to sleep.  I went flying with her and they searched us everywhere, usually making me take her out of the carrier.  It was easily done, even with one hand holding other items.  A wonderful product.
+1	This item is wonderful for taking my baby outside for a walk.  We have three dogs, and I need my hands free to walk the dogs, but I like for the baby to come along, too.  This is a good solution.  He gets to look at the world around him in the front facing position.  I've used it several times to take him for a walk, and I've also worn it when my husband and I have gone to an art fair.  My only reservation about this carrier is that the color is dark, and the fabric is thick.  On hot summer days, I can't use it because it will overheat the baby.  I wish that there were another option in a lighter color and a lightweight fabric for summer.
+1	I have used this carrier almost everyday since my son was 2 weeks old, and he's almost 7 months old now.  I didn't think I was going to use it that much but it has really come in handy for those quick trips, that way I don't need to take the stroller out of the trunk.  We live in an apartment and I use it when I need to do laundry, which is downstairs.  I just put my son in it and take him with me.  I also use it to do my shopping so that my 3 and 1/2 year old can sit in the cart.  My son also falls asleep very quick in this.  It is fairly expensive but after seeing how much use I am getting out of it, it is worth it.
+1	I really like how organized this set is. The one thing that I absolutely love is the bulb because there is no way to stick it in too far and it cleans easily by opening the top and then rinsing the inside with soap and water. There are alot of emory boards for filing baby nails and the clippers are absolutly safe. I have not yet used the other things but really, the bulb is the greatest thing in the world. Even if the other stuff ends up being worthless, I'd just go out and buy a better model to put in it's place. The case is pretty useful, you can even fit a small bottle of medicine in it.
+1	I use this little zipper bag as a sort of gadget purse for baby health things.  Even with everything in it I can find room for a Desitin tube, a bottle of Mylicon drops, a bottle of Baby Tylenol, Q-tips, and a little sample bottle of Eucerin cream for baby's exema.  On the side is a net pocket where I keep my pediatrician's appointment cards and medicine instructions.  Also, on the inside are a couple of pockets where phone numbers are kept on a provided card; I keep a pocket-sized record of baby's immunizations (that my nurse gave me) in there as well.  Very handy.
+1	This is a must have for all moms and dads.  I have used everything in this little kit so far, except for the dropper.  I keep it in my diaper bag at all times!
-1	I bought one of these and one of another brand, and put one in each car.  The other one worked great, but the bar at the bottom of this one warped in the sun within the first week.  It simply wasn't worth anything, since the other brand cost about the same and was more durable.
-1	I bought this as a 2 pack with a coupon and got it for free, but it is not even worth it for free.  It is a terrible product.  The suction cups are constantly coming off and the whole shade falls off which does not seem too safe if baby is sitting under it.  I threw them right in the trash.  First years makes a better product.
+1	They are spoons, really what can I say about them.  They go fine through the dishwasher.  I like them.  Pretty colors, soft tips.  Two thumbs up.
-1	Do yourself a favor and stick with Gerber spoons or another brand. These are NOT dishwasher safe!!!! I have used them for only a couple months (have a ten month-old who didn't start solids until 5 months). After just a month or so of use, the spoon color started to fade and bleed and change to a brownish yellow stain on each one. They are awful. I won't use them anymore because I'm worried about what could be getting into my baby's food. I highly recommend you avoid this item.
+1	I use these spoons a lot for feeding my eight months old twins. The handle is made of stainless steel while the spoon basin is made of BPA and phthalates-free plastic. ( I emailed the manufacturer to find that out and they responded quickly). The colors were very vibrant at first but soon started to absorb the color from carrots and sweet potatoes. I would give the spoons five stars if not for this. I hand wash them, so I can not say how they withstand dishwasher. Made in China but what is not? Actually, I found spoons that are made in GB:Avent Weaning Spoons 2-pack, but they are pricey.
+1	When my son was born, we tried sampling bottles from several different manufacturers, including Evenflo, Triflow, Avent, etc. Dr Brown's bottles really are the best in preventing gas, bottle leakage, and flow problems. We ended up throwing all other bottles away. I had read other reviews about the small parts being difficult to wash, but I don't really have a problem with that. We don't have a dishwasher and I end up hand washing everything. Each set of bottles comes with a tiny brush for getting into the small spaces for the inner parts to the bottles; and a regular bottle brush works fine with the bottles themselves. I can wash and fill 9 bottles in under 20 minutes (perfect timing when putting my son down for a nap). As to some reviewers complaints about leakage, it's true that if the inner tube gets full sometimes the milk can leak out the top - but this has only happened rarely and I've found that if I unscrew the cap and pull out the inner tube then put the tube back in (basically reassembling the bottle), the problem is resolved. The adjustment takes less than a minute and like I said, I've only had it happen once or twice. Otherwise the bottles, nipples and all the parts are really durable - especially the nipples. When we first bought the bottles, we bought all these replacement nipples in level 1 and ended up returning them because we never needed them. So, my only suggestions are1. hold off on buying extra nipples to see if you really need them (or at least don't open the package until you need to) and2. to bypass getting 4 oz bottles and go right for the 8 oz bottles. We started off with the 4 oz bottles and now, at 3 months old, our son is already up to 6 oz at a feeding. So, we had to pack away the 4oz bottles and go out and buy a bunch of the larger size.
+1	I only use these bottles, my daughter would not take any other ones right from the start. I can not compare to other brands but I can tell you that she doesn't spit up, which may be her naturally, but I wouldn't switch from these bottles just in case. They are more work to clean ,but if you buy enough they can be put in the dishwasher so it really isn't a big deal.  I also read other reviews about leaking and can honestly say I have never had a single leak.  There is a line on the bottle that says not to fill above and also for travel they provide a "travel disc" to fit under the nipple to prevent leaks so I am not sure how other people have all these problems.  I really think these are a great product and certainly worth trying!
+1	This bottle is an eye catcher because it's so different.  I can see how it works because my son is less fussy and he loves the soft texture of the nipple.  Although my son loves it, I on the other hand hate it when it comes to the washing.  How come there's so many parts to wash and not only that, the pieces are tiny too!  But this is the sacrifice you make for your young.
+1	Great price for 2 of these shields... I have been using shields since day 1 with my daughter so I am quite experienced. I have no trouble using them, and actually like the thickness of them as I wear them daily. Daughter has no issues with the shield either. Overall great price for 2 shields!
+1	I was struggling immensely with the pain of breastfeeding. So much so that I would sob every time our little girl latched and fed. It was horrible for our experience and for my husband to sit by and watch. Using a nipples shield changed everything! Our baby is now ten weeks old and I still use the sheild and experience no pain. I will continue to use it the entire time I feed her. I feel like she is able to get more milk with it and that her and I are able to bond and enjoy the experience of breastfeeding more. I use Lansinoh and The First Years lanolin free nipple butter after every feeding as well. The combination of everything kept me from giving up on breastfeeding and/or suffering through the pain. Added bonus, baby took a bottle instantly. I believe this was in part due to the similarity between sucking on the shield and a bottle nipple.
-1	I used these temporarily since initially my nipples were cracked and bleeding.  My husband had gotten me NUK-barely there at Walmart.  I ordered these (since I had their pump and loved it) and another brand through Amazon to see if they were better, and they both failed miserably.  My daughter latched on without problems with the NUK-barely there, but she hated these.  I believe since they were thicker and bulkier she disliked them.  After trying to use them multiple times, I gave up and ordered extra NUK-barely there nipple shields.  Don't waste your money on these.
+1	These are abit thicker than the medela ones they gave me in the hospital but me and my baby seemed to like them better. Great for latching problems!!
-1	My nipples are difficult to be latched for my baby.  And I feel very pain when I feed her everytime.  I really hope this one can solve my problem but it disappoint me.  It is hard to stick tightly on the breast, when my baby latched rubber nipples, it will become warped up on both sides, then it sticked on my baby's cheeks, it's so funny.  The other important thing is it smells not good after I sterilize it even thought the ads said it odorless. I only  tried once and will  not use it again.
+1	These are ok and worked great for me but be advised, if you don't have inverted or flat nipples and are using them solely for cracked and bleeding nipples, the baby could suck the ends of your nipples through the holes.  It also leaves the baby choking on milk from too fast a flow.
-1	I couldn't find any comparative reviews on different brands of nipple shields when I was trying to decide which one to purchase. I ended up buying the Medela Nipple Shield (20mm), the Philips Avent Nipple Protector and the Tommee Tippee Nipple Shield. Here are my reviews and pictures of the 3 different brand:Medela Contact Nipple Shield (20mm)This is the brand recommended by my lactation consultant. It's made of the thinnest silicone of the 3 brands and "sticks" the best. The height of the nipple part is a little too high for me and baby often makes a choking sound when trying to latch in the beginning. I LOVE how the Medela brand makes these in two sizes: 20mm and 24mm. It comes with just one shield, which makes it the most expensive of the 3.Philips Avent Standard Nipple ProtectorI purchased this based on looking at the product pictures, hoping that it would not be as high. Unfortunately, it is just as high as the Medela Nipple Shield, but also wider and thicker, making it difficult to stay in place and get baby to latch. Comes with 2 shields.Tommee Tippee Nipple ShieldThis nipple height was the least of the three brands. In theory, the extra cut outs along the side of the nipple part is supposed to promote more skin to skin contact, but as another reviewer stated, all it did was making my nipples sore because it would get sucked through the holes. Comes with 2 shieldsTake a look at the pictures to see the differences side by side. I hope this is helpful to those in search of nipple shields.
-1	The silicone was too thick for this, hard to keep it on. Might be handy if your kid is a super biter and otherwise doesn't have any feeding issues.
+1	Good quality, nice soft plastic.  I had trouble with the sides flipping up onto my little boys cheek. Not the biggest problem ever, but it was distracting to him.  I think the medela shields are worth the few dollars more.
-1	I bought these because I wanted very badly to breastfeed my daughter but we were having latch-on problems.  I was told that nipple shields could be helpful for this.I went with the Avent because overall, I am super impressed with their products.  I only use their bottles and pacifiers and have been a happy customer in the past.I don't really recommend these specific nipple shields.  I can't get them to stay in place and they are really akward.  My daughter dislikes using them and I can't get her to nurse with these.If you are in the market for a nipple shield, go with the Medela brand ones.  Those are much easier to use and less akward for baby.
+1	These shields are amazing! I've used them to breastfeed my DD since she was born (now 2 months old) - BF without them is incredibly painful for me, even with a very good latch. My baby has a super powerful suck and also tends to bite down as she falls asleep while nursing (as she often did in the first weeks) and without the shield, i'd get painful damage. Wearing the shields has made the experience bearable. They are super easy to use and wash and sterilize quickly and easily.
+1	These were my favorite nipple shields by far!  I tried the Medela brand prior and always had trouble with it staying in place.  The Avent nipple shields allow more of your skin to touch baby and they are soooo much more afordable which enabled me to purchase more so that I had a few to get me through night time feedings.  Also very durable and didn't seem to get as flimsy as the Medela with repeated washing & sterilizing.
+1	We had been using Dr. Brown bottles exclusively, but our little one was getting gas and seemed fussy after meals.  We bought one of the Ventaire bottles- just to try- but ended up with a fast flow nipple- much too fast for our three week old.  So, the bottle sat unused on the bottle rack for a week or so until I found slow flow nipples at a local store.  I brought them home and we tried the bottle out again- what a difference!!!  First of all, it is so much more comfortable to hold compared to the Dr. Brown!  Secondly, there are much fewer parts to assemble- and wash.  Thirdly, and most importantly, our little one is much less fussy and gassy after meals.  I went out today and bought 3 more of the 6 ounce bottles- they were the only size that came with the slow flow nipples.  We are going to keep the Dr. Brown bottles, but the Playtex Ventaires are our new go to bottles!
+1	I tried the Dr. Brown and Avent feeding systems but encountered several annoying problems. Both nipples flowed too fast causing my son to choke and gag, and led to terrible gas and spitting up with every feeding. I switched to the Playtex Ventaire system, which costs considerably less, and found my solution. My infant son now rarely spits up and hardly has any gas problems. Nor do I have to administer the Mylicon drops with every feeding as I did before! In short, our feeding experience underwent DRASTIC improvement upon switching to Ventaire bottles. Furthermore, even though we had been breastfeeding before, my son made a seamless transition to Ventaire with no trouble at all.The only hitch with the Ventaire bottles is you will find that some (not all) of the nipples have very small holes and so the milk flows too slowly, if at all.One last note. Ventaire does not make a "wide neck" bottle, which is admittedly easier to clean. However, I found the big Avent and Dr. Brown's bottles (8-9 oz size) to be cumbersome, especially when storing them in the fridge or in a diaper bag. The Ventaire bottles have a slimmer profile and are much lighter to pack and store.Every baby's needs are different and you've got to pick the system that works best for the both of you. For our particular situation, Ventaire was the best possible choice.
-1	As a single, first time mom to a beautiful 7 week old baby girl who is currently using the drop in system, I wanted to try a bottle that I didn't have to continue to buy things for. So when I saw these, I jumped right on them, since they were supposes to help with gas and colic just like the drop ins, little did I know they were going to be such a pain! I read the reviews saying that you could &#34;actually hear the air escaping from the bottle!&#34; This is not the case.1. There were so many bubbles in the bottle from her drinking that I was afraid it was going to give her gas not help stop gas.2. After washing them one time and reassembling them like the instructions said, they leaked all over the place from the bottom of the bottle! Talk about frustrating when you have a screaming baby wanting her bottle!3. To heat up the drop in bottles I would warm up a cup of water in the microwave and drop the bottle into it. With these, it doesn't work! After waiting 10 minutes with her screaming in my arms for her bottle the formula was still extremely cold! I had to run it under hot water for 10 more minutes for it to not be freezing, but it was still really cold! And at 2am you don't want to sit there with the water running forever just for the bottle to still be cold.Definitely not worth the money or your time! Save yourself a headache and don't even consider these bottles for your little one.
+1	I'm not sure if they are going to discontinue the VentAire bottles but they are getting extremely hard to find in stores, as well as the replacement nipples & discs. My son prefers these bottles over any of the others that we have. All the pieces can be a pain in the butt, but the bottle flows well & has a sleek design. I've used these bottles with my first born(6 years ago) and was very happy to see they're the same great quality now that I have another newborn.
+1	These are the only bottles my son will use and of course this design is discontinued. I took away a star because I got a pack with 3 pink bottles. Figures. FYI - the Dr. Brown's nipples fit these bottles exactly the same as the Playtex and you can still get those in the store. Way cheaper than trying to find the Playtex ones.
+1	These are the only bottles my baby will take without gagging or choking on the nipple.  She loves them.  I thought I would never find the right bottle, but Ventaire is it.  Maybe when she gets bigger she will do okay with other bottles but for now I will use these.
+1	These bottles are well made to stand up to the constant use of a newborn. The bent shape make it comfortable to use while feeding and the ease of transferring nipples will make for good swaps if your baby is particularly bite-y. One issue for some parents, for those who don't want to upgrade after the newborn stage, I don't think these will be good for upwards of the first year of a child's life. The size and setup don't really seem like something for anything but newborns.Regardless, it's a good newborn set that should satisfy all needs, because it can be used in conjunction with breastfeeding & formula.
+1	I actually like these bottles and we use these for formula and avent for breastmilk, just out of habit.  I think there is a little less burping after using these, but the extra parts to clean when you take the bottom off can be a nuisance.  We have never had leakage problems.
+1	Being a new parent, I was not sure which bottles to use. I bought these and another brand-I will say hands down these are better, my daughter has no issues with gas or hiccups.
-1	The idea of the bottles is good. They do help to reduce air. However, to me, it was not worth it b/c of the problems we had with the nipples. It seemed like every nipple had some sort of problem. EVERY bottle I bought was a newborn bottle- with newborn nipples ( I double and triple checked), but for some reason they ALL had different flows! Some would choke and gag him, some didn't even work and NOTHING would come out, some were okay... you get the point. It was always a guessing game with these bottles. We had to constantly try to keep up with which nipples were the good ones and which ones didn't work. And when you have a hungry, fussy baby, its no fun to be wasting time trying to keep up with stuff like that. On top of the fact that we had 20 bottles and only 2-3 nipples that worked the way they were supposed to. Another issue we had was that the nipples all colapsed! It was horrible. He would suck 10 times and the nipple would be colapsed. I felt that these bottles were very poor quality. Like I said, the idea of the VentAire is good, but the bottles just aren't up to my expectations.
+1	I've used all kinds of different bottles over the years from cheap Wal-Mart Specials to Avent and Dr Browns and these bottles are much closer to the higher end than the lower.  Here is a break down of what I like and don't like.Pros:-Baby doesn't seem to have much gas after using these.-It is very easy to clean the inside since both the top and the bottom come off.-They are very easy for both me and my baby to hold.Cons:-Since the top and bottom do come off there are 5 pieces to clean for each bottle, so it takes up a lot of room in the dishwasher.-The nipples seem a little faster than most others I've tried, so at first my baby made a big mess when using these because she wasn't used to fast flow.-The nipples and tops are very close looking to the Avent bottles, so sometimes I put the wrong ones on one or the other and they leak.So to summarize, I would get these bottles again and other than perhaps the Avent bottles, since they have less pieces to clean, these are my favorite that I've used.
+1	WE have a 3 month old that is now being introduced to bottles now that my wide is returning to work.  The vent Aire bottles seemed like a good choice since we've had to get rid of older bpa bottles that the other kids used...  The work as advertised,  allowing air to replace the milk volume a the baby eats....removing the vacuum pressure from the bottle.Cons:_you can't warm a bottle in hot water, since the bottom isn't water proof_more pieces to maker sure are clean, dry, and assembled correctlyI probably would not use one as a carry bottle,  but for filling right before using...Other than that...my son sees to burp less with them, so they are working as advertised.
+1	As I said in a previous review of the Starter product in this line, thePlaytex VentAire Advanced BPA Free Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set, the VentAire system is a vast improvement over the old standard every Mom, Nanny, Babysitter, Grandma or other caregiver is familiar with - the Playtex Nurser sytem with those plastic bag inserts that were supposed to create a vacuum as baby fed, cutting down on gas and discomfort.  While those WERE once a massive improvement, VentAire is the newest texhnology for allowing better pressure equalization, and a more cormftable feeding experience for both mother an baby that more closely mimics the natural position of Breastfeeding.  This is done by using specially angled bottles and the exlcusive VentAire disk system.  I started out with the Newborn set so I'm now a little more adept at inserting the disks into place and using the bottle itself.  I'm pleased that they are making it clear that their bottles are BPA-free since that's an issue that now concerns most new parents or experienced parents with a new baby after a long time off Bottle Duty.I have read the complaints about the slow flow nipple and I have found that I did not encounter anywhere near the frustration others have reported.  However, that was for a Newborn sized bottle.  It did take a little getting used to but before swithing to the Fast Flow and perhaps creating waterfalls of milk or formula all over your infants face and your chest, check out the Medium Flow Nipples available here on Amazon:Playtex BPA Free VentAire Advanced Silicone Nipples, 2 Pack, Medium FlowThe set  pictured here is a 9 ounce set of 3 bottles all with the FAST FLOW nipples.  If you are already needing a 9 Ounce Bottle, you probably will not need the Slow flow Nipple anyway but if you do, you should know that you can by the Slow Flow, Medium Flow and Fast Flow Nipples separately in 2-packs here at Amazon.  I picked up some Medium Flow Nipples locally and had some better success with them earlier on.  I had a difficult time finding them but I'm pleased to see that AMAZON carries all three Nipple stages.  It's best to stock up on those since you'll go through the Nipples faster than the bottles themselves, which are petty sturdy and easy to clean.I don't use a bottle warmer since I pump.  I warm the milk up from the refrigorator in the Pumps packaging.  I cannot see how a traditional Bottle-Warmer would accomodate this new system.  Personally, I've never had the need myself but I Imagine this may be a deal breaker for some Moms.  Still, this and the Newborn set would make nice gifts for either a New Mom or one who has been struggling with the old Playtex Nurser.  It takes a little practice - a couple of days or so, to get the hang of this but I am quite pleased with the results.
+1	You can open both ends of the bottle. Makes for an easier clean up. Does not leak. Designed for an even flow. Great product!
+1	Works perfectly! My son can enjoy drinking without slurping, coughing and spitting. He fell asleep today while drinking from the bottle - something that never happened with regular bottles before. Super easy to use and clean. Nobody should use regular bottles when these are available.My son is almost 2 months old and likes the slow flow nipple quite well.
+1	These are great but the aware that they have fast flow nipples. My son is four months old and only used to the slow flow nipples &#8211; these come with fast flow so I had to purchase a set of slow flow nipples &#8211; and they do make a huge difference&#8230; My son will not drink out of the fast ones &#8211; he leaks everywhere and does not get anything down&#8230;
-1	Let me start by saying that we used Playtex Ventair bottles with my first child.  The bottles were great--durable and well-made.  We used them throughout her "bottle-hood"--for over a year.  No problems.However, we began using these again with our second child.  We were excited to hear that they were BPA-free and with our past experience with Playtex bottles, we were happy to purchase these.Within 3 weeks, the ink on the bottles came off of them.  So we had to use sharpie pens to mark the ounces.  And within 3 months, they began to leak.  We bought about 20 bottles...from a various number of stores.  So now we are stuck with 20 leaking bottles that require a sharpie every few weeks.  Perhaps it was because we washed them in the dishwasher...but really, the bottles should be prepared to handle that.Please don't waste your money on these bottles.  They appear great at first but go downhill quickly.
+1	My favorite part about these bottles are the nipples.  They are wide and a tad bit short and my babies latched wonderfully to these nipples.*The slow flow nipple is VERY slow.  But that's a good thing.  Most slow flow nipples drown my babies.  The slow flow is great for breast milk.  The medium flow nipple is great at about 4 months, with just formula, no cereal.*The fast flow nipple is AMAZING!  It works great on the Dr Browns bottles too (vent aire nipples are my choice for Dr Browns bottles.  Cereal come through the Fast Flow nipple perfectly with no cutting of the nipple.These bottles are much easier to clean than Dr Brown's, and they provide the same fluid flow as Dr Brown's without having to deal with the middle insert of the Dr Brown's.The cap on these bottles "touches" the top of the nipple and therefore the bottles do not leak while in the diaper bag.  This is a major reason I love the bottles.Two things I dislike about these bottles.*you cannot mix four scoops of formula and 8 oz of water in the bottle.  There's no room to shake it all up.  So I have to pre mix the formula and then pour into the bottles.  Dr Brown's have more room in the bottles to accommodate all the water and powder.*These bottles are crooked not straight, so they are difficult to prop.  With twins, I had to prop bottles sometimes.Mom of 7, RN
+1	I chose to exclusively bottle feed with both my children, I have a 2 1/2 year old girl and a 3 month baby boy. These are the only bottles we have ever used. I would say they are very durable; for the new baby we were still able to use my daughter's bottles, they held up for the entire year she was drinking bottles and continue to hold up now. We never warmed formula so I wasn't aware of the issues others have stated with not being able to microwave or whatever, and since the dishwasher sterilizes, we didn't use a separate sterilizer either. It definitely takes awhile for them to drink with the slow-flow but at just 1 month old we were able to switch to the fast flow kind and from then on it's no problem. With my daugher we did try the wide Playtex bottles as well as the Avent but with both, the milk flowed out of the sides of her mouth so we switched to the standard.I would definitely recommend these bottles in the standard, seems to fit their little mouths perfectly.
+1	I don't have a baby but I gave the bottles to a friend to use and give me feedback. Her response was good and she told me the best feature is the Micro-Channel Vent Technology that keeps air at the back of the bottle rather than mixing it with the milk.  She indicated the baby burped less and noticed there was no spit-up as there was using her other bottles.  She also liked the form of the bottle because it seemed easier for the baby to hold.I noticed others said the air vents leaked and were messy.  I asked her if she had any issues in this regard and she said she didn't.Playtex has always made a good product and it seems the bottles are certainly in that category.
+1	Breast feeding is wonderful but trying to supplement with bottle when you are away can be a challenge to finicky babies. These bottles are wonderful and well accepted as an "alternative".
-1	These bottles suck!  A complete waste of money, maybe my daughter will use them to play with her dolls years down the road.  They are a HUGE pain to use.  For one you can't use a bottle warmer (the water seeps up into bottle).  We had to hold it under running water which takes forever.  It took my daughter FOREVER to drink the bottle from the nipples.  If you are concerned about gas use Dr. Brown's bottles, they have more parts but easy to put together.
+1	I babysit a friend's 5 month old boy a few days a week.  He still spits up quite a bit for his age so I thought I'd try these bottles with him.  His mom just uses regular, straight bottles.The first time I used this bottle with him there didn't seem to be as many air bubbles in the bottle as there usually are.  When I burp him he usually spits up at least a little bit but the first time, he didn't spit up at all.  I thought for sure it must be just a fluke.  I've now been using these bottles with him for the week and have only had 2 spit ups!  I'm thrilled with it and so is his mom!
+1	Pro-these were great for our reflux, upset belly twins.Con- There are a few pieces to clean : including the nipple 5 things per bottle so if you don't like to wash then these might not be for you (I should mention I only hand wash our bottles so that is a factor but still worth using them!)
+1	There isn't enough room for me to describe why I love these better than any other brand! I have read the reviews on multiple bottles and have been buying bottles for over 20 years. These recommendations I find are very personally fit. It's hard to determine sometimes!
+1	After trying the Medela, Avent, then Dr. Brown's bottles, I found that these worked the best for my son AND me. The Medela and Avent had no venting system, causing the nipple to collapse and the baby getting frustrated. The Dr. Brown's bottles had too many small parts that were a PIA to keep clean.The thing is, each baby is different and will prefer different bottles - even the vehemently negative reviewers for this product should understand that. Like ANY brand of bottle, perhaps purchase a single bottle before going with the 3-pack to see if it works well for you and baby. In my case, these worked perfectly. I recommend you give them a try.
+1	I thought baby bottles were pretty basic, but the improvements Playtex has made do seem to make a difference.  When Sarah, my daughter, recently gave birth, she received an earful of advice from well-meaning friends and relatives who were also new moms.  Many used and recommended Playtex VentAire baby bottles.  Sarah listened, starting out with the VentAire newborn bottle gift set (wide bottles & nipples).  She also has these standard bottles (slimmer bottle/nipples).  At this point in time, mom and baby seem to prefer wider ones.  Sarah finds them easier to clean; baby likes the nipple shape better.  That preference will probably change as baby gets older and wants to hold a slimmer bottle having a faster flow of milk.Of course, that wasn't the only advice that went along with VentAire bottles.  Sarah was warned they might leak if improperly tightened (don't overdo the bottoms), or if the pieces were wet while assembling (particularly the vent area).  She has never put them in the dishwasher (more motherly advice) even though Playtex information says pieces are top-rack dishwasher safe.  As a result, the bottles work well and baby rarely has spit-up, burping or gas problems.  Mom and baby are happy.
+1	I'm certainly not a mother - but gave these to a new Mom who gave them rave reviews.  She calls them a "high tech" bottle and loved the way they prevented her newborn from gulping too much air.
+1	Title says it all! I've tried a lot of the other baby bottles: Dr. Brown, Nuk, Tommee Tippee, Born Free, & Avent.These Playtex VentAire are by far my favorite!
+1	I like the bent neck but since I didn't use any other bottles I have nothing to compare it to.
+1	After trying many other brands and styles of bottles, my wife and I agree that the Playtex Ventaire are the best.Less pieces than Doc Brown, excellent venting system, inexpensive nipples to replace as your baby grows and you need higher flow.
+1	I love the Playtex brand, and the VentAire bottles are really very good.  I like that the bottles is angled and that helps with gas.  The only thing is sometimes they do leak, but I make sure that the bottle parts are completely dry before I assemble and mix formula.  These save you so much money compared to the drop in bottles. They are a definite keeper.
+1	We had the smaller (5 ounce) versions and they were our favorite (compared to medela and avent).So naturally we went ahead to try these ones. They have a nice slow flow, and provide the "air vents" at the bottom.However, I must note that those vents are like 99% gimmick. You hear the air come out of them like twice per drink (which can be like an hour if you have a little one that gets tired and sleepy every time they eat).We have used them quite a bit, and there is really virtually no difference in gas between these and the other 2. Add the fact that you virtualy never hear any air come out of it, and you get the idea.The shape is nice, especially if your baby has trouble holding down the food and you have to feed them in a more upright position.Overall a nice baby bottle for your baby.Highlights:- convenient shape- slow flow (pro or con depending on what you want)- ventaire system a gimmick
-1	Pissed is an understatement.  I purchased these bottles to decrease the amount of air that my daughter was sucking in and these bottles came highly recommended.  The first set I purchased began to leak from the bottom and from around the cap so I thought it was a bad batch and exchanged them for another set.  Last night while I was feeding my daughter I am thinking that she is drinking the milk but it was leaking from the side of the cap and down into her neck and onesie on this new set!  I switched bottles and gave her another one.  This morning I shake the bottle over the sink to make sure that the rice and breastmilk are mixed in good before feeding her and the cap which I just checked just popped off and breastmilk went flying all over the sink.  6 ounces of milk just gone!  These bottles leak from the bottom and after many uses the ring around the cap warps so it doesn't screw on and stay flush with the bottle itself.  I am done at this point and these bottles are going back to BRU and I am going to do what I should have done in the beginning and just go with Dr. Brown's bottles.  I would never recommend these crappy bottles to anyone!
+1	Unlike the previous review we loved these bottles, and yes we have a baby that spits up alot and the bottles do make the difference. Our son loves these bottles, they help on the gas and the spitting up and he is able to latch on and drink with no major effort. We also love having a different choice of nipple sizes. Both of my children were given ceral bottles at young ages by there doctors and with my first we had to poke hole in the nipple and hope it worked. With my son we are able to buy stage 2 nipples and not owrry about him getting too much formula too fast. These are wonderful
+1	We have a four-month-old daughter who has been using Playtex VentAire standard bottles for the past month with notable success.  They have worked nicely for the following reasons:1. The bottles did not cause the dreaded "nipple confusion" when transitioning between the bottle at daycare and breastfeeding when baby is with mom.2. Although it does have a lot of pieces, the fact that the bottle disassembles completely makes it easy to thoroughly clean and disinfect its various parts.The bottles have presented one challenge:1. Replacement parts - like extra slow flow nipples - can be hard to find.  Nipples wear out, and wanting extras to have on hand, I ended up buying extra bottles instead because it was nearly impossible to find the slow flow variety (and it was cheaper to buy extra bottles from Amazon than to pay the exorbitant shipping from the two sources who sold the nipples separately).UPDATE (3/2012): As my daughter has reached her first birthday, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding. We have also used Playtex Drop-Ins. This is how the two compare:1. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).2. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). (In both cases, this refers to the slow flow nipple variety for each bottle.)2. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider.
+1	We were a die hard Avent family becasue of our daughter tummy troubles.  But they just didn't seem to be working for her.  They were great in reducing air intake, but she just seemed to leak an awful lot with them.  She would be covered by the time she was done and that was with the number 1 nipples.  Plus for some reason my husband and mother has trouble with the bottle themselves leaking.  So I started to research and try other bottles.We hated the liner in the nursers, she hated Dr. Brown's, and the paln jane bottles allowed her to take in too much air.  So we were stuck on Avent until last week.  My cousin had a little girl and we traded a bottle to try the other guys out.Well, we steralized what we had and traded!  Her daughter does great on the Avent and doesn't leak....our daughter does great with the Vent Aire and does not leak.  I guess it just depends on teh child.  But, these are great.  She manges to keep it all in her mouth and she doesn't fill up with air.  They are also more afforable than the Avent.Anotehr plus is that she is 3 months now and very much wants to hold her own bottle and with these, she is almost there.  She can wrap her hands around them and pull her feet up for extra support and just about hond them herself.  This feat makes her very happy and the lack of leaks and tummy aches make us very happy.
+1	Here's my baby bottle round-up, my favorite is the Playtex Ventaire.Playtex Ventaire: These are excellent because they let the extra air out (like Dr. Brown's) to make it easier for your baby to continuously drink but mostly because they are really easy to clean since you can unscrew the bottom.  I feel a lot better about them getting really clean and they are easy to throw in the dishwasher.  The only downside with them is that they take a little longer to heat in the bottle warmer and sometimes the hot water from the warmer gets stuck in the bottom and can drink down the sides and get on your baby if you don't wipe it down before you give it to them.  They don't fit with Medela pumping stuff and all of my nipples are the same flow, which is fine for my baby from 6 months up.  I'm bit sure if they make slow flow.  Overall, my favorite out of the ones listed below.Dr. Brown's: Also pretty good but they have overall too many parts (bottle, nipple, screw on lid, straw thing and other little venting part.)  I have somehow managed to lose a bunch of the random parts so now I only have 3 complete sets.  They are also kind of a pain to clean, the long straw thing is hard to get clean.  They work pretty well overall but a little inconvenient.  They also fit with my Medela pumping stuff, which is nice.Medela: These are my least favorite.  They work well with my Medela pumping stuff but that's about it.  They also only have 3 parts, which is nice, but they don't have anyway to release the air so I have to stop my baby from drinking every once in a while to release the backed up air.Lansinoh Momma: These bottles are a little gimmicky.  I'm not really sure why they are good for breastfeedng babies, I think it's just a big gimmick.  The flow is way too fast for a baby under 6 months and for some reason my little girl decided at some point she just didn't like them at all.  They also don't work with pumping stuff and they have a weird shape, which makes it hard to fit them in the bottle warmer.  I would pass on these.
+1	We switched to using almost allPlaytex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottles 9-Ounce, 3 Pack (Colors Vary)as our main bottle. The nipple ring is tight and the nipple is stiff, the bottle design prevents nipple collapse and makes airflow work in the perfect combo so that he never got a gassy tummy again. Spend the money, buy the good stuff.  My choice for standard nipples is Playtex ventaire nipples too. Since we began using those nipples NO LEAKS. The only problem is they are hard to find. These bottles are hard to find too, Amazon actually has the best prices so go ahead and buy here you've nothing to loose with free two day shipping ( www.amazon.com/mom) The nipples if you don't want to order online can be found at Target. They have the best price for stage two nipples, since they are not offered here on Amazon unfortunately.Good luck, hope this helps. We Love these.
+1	Don't read negative or positive reviews. Just TRY this bottle. Just get 1 bottle at the store and see if it works for you. Try different nipple. Just find what works for you. Thats it.It's different for different babies...We tried Dr. Browns, Playtex wide nipple nurser and then Ventair. The Stage 1 nipple was too slow and my baby would suck for 30 min and only get half an once out of 6 oz! But then I got the Stage 2 nipple and it works great! It says Fast flow but I would say it is medium. My baby chokes often when she drinks from Dr Browns.. She never choked drinking from the Ventair.
+1	If you don't have a dishwasher, it is so very hard to get a bottle clean - especially if you rinsed it & tossed it in your diaper bag during a day away from home.  These made cleaning so much easier since the top and bottom come off.  Surprisingly, they did not leak! They also do really reduce the amount of air a baby takes in while feeding.
+1	I love these bottles. They are not my favorite kind, but I am very pleased with them. I only gave it 4 stars because the nipples it came with were no good and had to be replaced, but other than that I am satisfied.
+1	A couple years ago, we bought a lot (probably more than we really needed) of baby bottles that all offered different options.  We ended up using all of them so we didn't have to wash them as often, but I have to say the Playtex bottles were the best as they help prevent gas and colic.  We plan on using these more than any of the other types with the next baby as they make things a lot easier.  Although the shape of the bottle has that slight tilt to it, I don't think it really makes it any more difficult to dry on one of those special racks.  The only down side is there was occasionally a couple drips of milk coming out of the bottom of the bottle (not sure if I did something wrong to allow or if something can be done to prevent that).Comparing Playtex bottles to the others we tried, I have to say the Playtex bottles are one of the few bottles out there that are trying to prevent colic and gas.  The only other brand I can think of that does this is Dr. Brown.  Slight dripping isn't entirely unusual with other bottles, as the glass bottles we got would actually drip where the nipple would screw on.  We didn't experience any drips with Medela, but they are plain bottles and do nothing to address the colic/gas issue.  So I would definitely recommend the Playtex bottles and they make a great gift for expecting parents.
+1	I'll start by saying that liner-based bottles are a thing of the past. I'm not sure why anyone would still consider them. So, thats a positive for this product already.This set works as well as the other mainstream brands. I think these leaked significantly less than comparable models. And by leaking, I mean the leaking caused by milk being in the grooves of the lid when you screw the lid on. That gap is the killer from which many a mess has been made.Grade; 4stars
+1	First and foremost I love that these are BPA free. That is very important to us in this house with all our plastic products. This is a decent sized bottle. Not to small, but not a waste of space and to large. We are definitely loving the angled bottles vs the straight bottles. No leaks at all!
+1	I prefer the VentAire bottles with the wider nipple bases.  These nipple bases are really narrow.  If you are looking for nipples that are likely better for breastfed babies, I would go with the wider nipples.  Because of the difference, obviously the tops are not interchangeable, but the bases between the wider bottles and these thinner bottles are interchangeable.  These are easy to use and wash, they make my baby less gassy, and she can hold the bottle if I need her to.  I still prefer the wider bottles, though, since she is generally breastfed.  I have switched to VentAire bottles over the drop-ins, Tommy Tippee and Avent bottles because I like these the best.
+1	These bottles are working great for my both 19 and 5th months. Although I agree with the fact that cheaper bottles do the trick, my children prefered these from all other I tried. A lot have to do with the nipple. Any way, what ever are your intentions, that's your child that's going to choose his bottle !!
+1	These bottles really work for my 5 week old son.  They have worked since we started using them when he was a week old.  I guess because the air escapse through the bottom instead of in the baby's belly, we have found that he has minimal gas and needs less burping.  It has not, however, decreased the spitting up.  My husband and I have tried at least 6 other brands of bottles and these and the playtex drop-in's have been most sucessful for us.  I can actually see how the bottles are reducing air intake whereas the other ones seem more like a gimic and their anti-colic mechanisms are not readily apparent.  Also, the nipples on these bottles are smaller.  The new trend is to have large round nipples more like the breast which might be better for babies going back and forth between bottle and breast but for babies that have only been bottle fed, sometime the smaller nipple is easier for them when they are very young or very congested.
+1	THE BEST! Not only did he get  less gas, I hand wash and these bottles are easy to clean. Yes it requires taking them apart and putting them back together again, but I know every speck of the bottle gets very clean. I have never had a single leak. I love that you can use eth same bottles with different flow rates. Easy for my son to hold on his own. I recommend these and will use these next time as well.
+1	These bottles are very durable and have lasted a LONG time. Minus a little fading, these bottles look new and the parts still work well.
+1	these are great bottles. I got them for my great-grand son who is due in March. Mother was very pleased to receive such good bottles.
-1	I'm actually not a fan of these bottles, but for me, the problem lies moreso with the nipple. My son spent half his energy trying to suck the formula out of them. Even after going up a size, it didn't seem to make a difference. I gave up after a few feedings. Also, when he did manage to actually eat, he would still get fussy and gassy- an issue these bottles claim to reduce. In my opinion, there are better bottle options out there.
+1	I bought this to use as a nursing footstool and I love it. But I can easily see myself using it long after I am done nursing. It's the perfect size and shape, it has a cozy pocket for my feet, and its lightweight enough to kick out of the way if I need to get up in a hurry. Highly recommended!
+1	Great small, lightweight nursing stool....soft on your feet providing the support you need while nursing or just sitting comfortably. I haven't seen anything else like this and it is just perfect for my small nursery. Also easy to tote around. I would give it 5 stars but as others mentioned the fact that it picks up every hair and pc of lint is a minor annoyance. I vacuum mine often or roll with a lint brush since I have pets.
+1	This is the perfect little stool to accompany any rocker or glider. It is light weight and you can throw it in the closet when you aren't using it. It is super comfortable on your feet and a great height for nursing. Really happy with this! A great price compared to all the expensive matching ottomans out there as well. I live in an NYC apt where space is at a premium. This was a perfect alternative for us!
+1	After having given up on finding a good footstool for my nursery, I saw this on a friend's baby registry and for the price, had to try it. Well, it is great. So great I bought a second one for the living room so i could stop carting it around everytime I wanted to breastfeed someplace other than the nursery. It's sturdy enough that I also sat on it sometimes on the floor. Now that Baby is 11 months old, I still use it when holding her in the rocking chair. But surprisingly, it has become a nursery toy! Now that she is crawling, she loves climbing on it. And because it is so soft I'm completely comfortable with it. Sometime's I turn it over, lay her belly down on the flat side and rock her back and forth a little on it.Mine did start of look a little dingy after some use - and who has time to wash these when you are washing all those newborn clothes. So I can't comment on how well they wash!
-1	I love the idea of this sling and it is sturdy and attractive, but my 10 week old son just cannot get comfortable in it.  I keep thinking he's just too small and is getting lost in it, but even as he grows I am still trying to make him more comfortable by adding a blanket to position him better.  I really want to use this sling, but I feel like he's either too deeply inside the sling and he will suffocate or by adding a blanket underneath him, he's too close to the edge and will tumble out.  The edge draws strings to tighten him in just do not do the trick.  I'll keep trying because this product seems like a great idea and it was not cheap, but perhaps it's just a little too much work for a newer baby.If this company or any other consumer, has any ideas on how to improve my situation with this sling,I would love to hear from them.  Email me at:  Jul262003@yahoo.com
-1	My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long... He wasnt the tiniest baby... I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing... It's the WORST product ever, I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill...
-1	I was very excited to get this sling.  I love that most people don't realize I'm holding a baby when wearing it -- this makes nursing even more discreet than in a normal sling as you don't draw attention from people wanting to see the baby.  The outside zipper pockets are great for keys, cell, wallet, etc., and the style is great (it looks more like a messenger bag until you're close up) & I've recieved lots of complements.  My 2 mo. old dd is very comfortable sitting in it.That said, I would not buy it again.  My daughter hated it as a newborn & would immediately scream if I put her in.  The drawcord needs to be knotted to avoid danger of strangulation (very unsafe, not to mention inconvenient for adjusting).  The sling is uncomfortably narrow at the shoulder & doesn't distribute weight well.
+1	My grand daughter loves this set. The colors are bright and fun and just the right size for your hand. Plus, it is durable and the bristles are just right for a 2 year old's head.
+1	I have used both the brush and the comb on our newborn.  The bristles on the brush are so soft, he likes the massage, and it helps rid his head of the cradle cap.  The comb is also soft, I certainly wouldnt violently run it through my newborns scalp, but with a gentle stroke it works just fine!
-1	Looks cute and colorful.  Brush is not bad. Comb bristles are way thin/sharp/hard for adults, let alone a baby.  Will be returning the set.
+1	what can i say...cute as a bug...price was great, they are very cute, perfect for my grandchild (bedroom decorated in ladybugs)
+1	This is perfect to use on my 1 year old great grandson.  He loves that it looks like a ladybug and worm and it works great on his hair.  They are both well made and in pretty colors.
+1	i love the fact that you can buy replacement nipples for the different stages instead of buying new bottles. Wish they would sell in stores but I guess the stores would lose money.
+1	I wish I would have known that the only difference between these spouts and the ones for younger children is the color and the fact that these are made of hard plastic and the others are soft.  Otherwise, no difference.  I do like the Avent spouts in general as they are about as leak proof as a sippy cup spout can be.
-1	As I have stated with the trainer set, they are okay if your child takes to them, just don't buy more than one set if you are not sure your child will take it. I would recommend buying one set from Target ( or some grocery stores cary Avent) and trying first. If it works, then buy more sets online. You will know within days if your child will take to it.
+1	Let me start by saying I think it's WONDERFUL of Avent to offer their consumer the option to modify what they already own!  I bought 2 Avent bottles for our son to use while my mom watched him for our anniversary.  He was exclusively breastfed & only used 1 bottle, that 1 time.  When his doctor suggested starting him on sippy cups with a little bit of water (6months), I really didn't want to run out & buy something else that would take up more space in our cabinets.  I bought these guys & the handles.  Our son loves the handles, but has really struggled with the spout.  I would go so far as to say he cannot drink from it.  I eventually caved & bought 2 Nuby 2 Handle Cups with Soft Spouts.  He can drink out of the super soft spout much easier.  I do wish this product would have worked for him because when I screw on the Nuby lid, the spout does not align with the handles.  The Avents *always* align.  To sum it up, I am giving it 4 stars even though it didn't work for our family, because (1) I love that Avent offers a modification for consumers, (2) the handles rock & the spout & handles align super easily, & (3) my baby is exclusively breastfed & has very little experience with bottles (1 bottle, 1 time) - I believe a baby who knows how to drink from a bottle would have a much easier time with this product.
-1	These create lots of tiny bubbles that my son swallows when he drinks from this top. It's a terrible design because the rubber on the back side covers the air vent and the spout so the air gets sucked into babies mouth instead of back in the cup. Boo! I was really excited to still use my Avent bottles to transition to cups, but this prodect doesn't cut it, I ended up buying other sippy cups.
+1	This was exactly what I needed to convert some 4 month old sippy cups to those that could be used by my 11 month old.  Thanks
+1	We put these spout in all our cups. This is more of what I call a Soft spout even though described as hard. Easy to clean and my kids love them. Great design Avent!
+1	i like avent products. imagine those bottles can turn into sippy cups. indeed this spout is totally non spill and very gentle on baby's gums. i just wish i picked a different color because the white can get stained when you give baby a drink after eating baby food.
-1	These are not nearly as good as the yellow ones. They leak every time. I use them with the Pura bottles and have used the yellow Avent spouts since the beginning but have been unable to find them so I finally just bought these thinking they would be just as good. They're not.
+1	Our daughter uses 2 sippy cups a day.  I was disappointed when a couple of our valves broke.  There are slits in the ends of these valves that allow them to both keep a seal & to allow the liquid the flow.  A couple of the slits broke & the sippy cups were no longer functional.I went to a big box baby products store looking for these.  An employee told me that these were not sold because Playtex wants to sell more sippy cups.  She suggested that I had to throw away my cups & buy completely new cups.  Instead I came onto Amazon & found these.  I was so grateful!  We now have extra valves in case more break.
+1	I'm so glad they sell these separately.  These fit our cups just fine.  We seem to be great at losing the inserts!  Cheaper than having to buy new sippy cups!
+1	Buying these lets me extend the life of all my son's sippys.  These valves make or break the sippy, so glad they were a resonable price.
+1	i was no able to find these in store so i bought them online. i love them. better to replace the valves than the whole cup!
+1	These are exactly the same as the inserts that come with the platex sippy cups. I was so glad to find these because we seem to keep losing the inserts and I don't want to have to replace an entire cup due to the lack of an insert. They work just as good as the original. I bought the smaller pack and then promptly lost some more inserts so now I'm wishing I bought the larger pack to have some extras.
+1	We just needed replacements for our sippy cups.  These work great.  I just throw them in the dishwasher and call them good.  Little longer for shipping but there hard to find in Walmart half the time to it's worth it.
+1	Arrived quick. Always need these. Replacement valves save the cups. I love that Playtex offers replacements, since our other brand cups don't. When those get lost or broken, we have to throw the cups away.
+1	These are the typical rubber replacement valves. It's good to have a few extras on hand. I appreciate that I don't have to replace an entire cup.
+1	This works great in our master bath since we have an oversized tub and I need the added height this kneeler provides to reach/bathe my baby. In our other (smaller/lower) tub, I only use a towel -- since the step/kneeler would give me too much height and cause me to bend over more and hurt my back. So ... figure out if you need added height before buying this. If you don't, go with a pad (or just folded towel).
-1	This item is a great IDEA. Key word, 'IDEA'.PROS:- It's a 4-in-1: elbow rest, knee rest, storage pocket for wash/shampoos, and then later can be used as a stepping stool.- Cute little ice animal theme, polar bears, penguins, whales, etc.- The elbow rest has suction cups that attach to the tubside.- The little storage pockets that hang on the side are helpful for all those crazy bath toys and products babies come with.CONS:- What I did not consider before purchasing this item was the placement of my bathtub's faucet and the toilet. We have two bathrooms, and both bathtubs, on the side where the faucet is the toilet is directly next to it. Generally, if one were to be giving their child a bath, they would be right by the faucet so that they could control the water flow/temperature.... With toilets directly next to my bathtubs, I can't exactly kneel with 3 inches between the two porcelain objects. Hah. I sit uncomfortably on the closed toilet instead and lean over the whole time, which SUCKS.- The stool does not raise up to be any higher than what the picture shows. It is a very VERY short stepping stool, and will be useless for quite a while.- The suction cups for the elbow rest POP OFF almost every time you lean on it, which defeats the purpose. They were very hard to get to stay put in the first place before anyone ever leaned on it.- Also, the top of the elbow rest CRACKED after maybe the 2nd time we used it.Conclusion:I LOOOVED the idea of this product. Still haven't seen a similar product, but I was very disappointed with the quality and exact features of this, and I was frustrated with myself for not considering that I couldn't even use this feature because of my bathroom set-ups. This will be up for sale at my next garage sale.
+1	We got this for the upcoming arrival of our daughter.  But, the first time I used it was to clean the tub after my husband gave the dog a bath.  IT IS AWESOME!  It's very sturdy and has alot of padding.  I love the arm rest, it came loose a couple of times but a quick cleaning of the side of the tub and suction cups solved that.  I was worried when I read the other reviews of this product, but once I gave it a try I was hooked.  Our daughter and dog will never have a bath again without it.
-1	The kneeler is not very sturdy.  I was not comfortable kneeling on it, and I felt like my weight would break right through the flimsy little styrofoam-like cushion.  If that is what the manufactorer considers cusioning, I'm not impressed.  I might as well kneel on a folded towel.  I was hoping for something that would be soft.  Also, the construction of the item is not very sturdy.  It is made of plastic, and it does not seem at all durable.  The elbow &quot;cushion&quot; is also not very soft.  It is not secure, either.  When I leaned against it to test it, it slid right off.  If I'd been busy bathing my baby, I would have tumbled into the tub with him.  I don't recommend this product.
+1	This Kneeler & Step Stool thing looks great.  We gave it as a gift but I totally wanted one for myself after seeing it.  I think it would really help your knees & elbows during bath time.
-1	I registered and received this monitor as a shower gift.  I thought it would be great.  My daughter is 10 months now and I have already bought another monitor.  Within the first month of use the hand-held audio only monitor broke.  The video actually works really well and aside for some NOISY interference that it picks up sometimes, its a great picture day or night.  The camera is kind of a pain, though.  The way that it is angled, you need to mount it on the wall above the crib, or have it sitting on a tall piece of funiture that can overlook the crib.  I don't have that, so we only really use it for the sound.  The monitor is very large, though, and so it would have been nice if the hand held auido one worked - so I could take it to another room.  This model has too many problems I wouldn't buy it if I could do it over again.
+1	If you are considering a monitor... pay extra for a VIDEO monitor.The picture is clear and can be adjusted to be lighter or darker for those of us that like a darker room to sleep in.  I simply could not of gotten any sleep as a first time mother had I not been able to see my son peacefully sleeping in his crib every time I opened my eyes at night.We use both the video monitor and the separate hand held monitor all the time and have had no problems that could not be adjusted easily.Forget getting up all night long to check on your angel and buy a VIDEO monitor instead.
+1	Here is an UPDATE.  Purchased 6 months ago/Broke down 01/30/05 Okay! Maybe I should have paid more attention to the reviews.  All was fine, but then this weekend DEAD! The monitor went out. *Don't waste your money.  You are better off purchasing a system that works with your pc monitor.After reading the reviews on this monitor, I thought purchasing it would be a mistake. Don't pay attention to reviews!  It work great! There are many questions in regards to interference with cordless phone and such. I have a Panasonic 2.4 GHz phone system (4 units) in my home, a wireless internet connection, and many other technical items, and have no interference. The monitor sits in my office on my desk next to the cordless phone system, my pc, monitor, speakers, and there are no problems.  The picture is not snowy.  The night vision element works fine.  I have had this product for 5 months and it has not broken down.  It is nice to be able to see baby.  Now I can let her sleep or stay awake without my presence, and know she is fine!
+1	UPDATE:  I first reviewed this item back in April 2005, when my daughter was 4 months old.  She is now 15 months old and the monitor is still working prefectly well.  We have not had any problems with the night vision nor the sound. We keep the monitor turned on throughout the night and while our daughter takes naps.  The pictures is lighter or darker depending on the sorrounding light, so make sure you adjust it accordingly.  We have a second child on the way and will deffinately be using the monitor with him/her.  If it breaks, we will most deffinately buy another one.  Once you have it, you become dependent on it... :-)Feel free to view my 4 stars as a full 5!I must say I was a bit concerned with getting this monitor after reading previous comments, but I'm glad I did get it!  The picture is clear and the contrast options allows for the brightness of the monitor to be adjusted at night.  I would've given it 5 stars, but every now and then I have a problem with static.  All and all I'm glad I got it and would recommend it to anyone!
+1	We love Kiddopotamus products and this one is no exception. We don't use this anymore because my daughter is a toddler but we used it since the day my daughter was born and we brought her home from the hospital. No slouching, very comfy and cozy - a definite must buy for any baby shower. (In fact I've bought quite a few for friends having babies.) AWESOME. Yeah Kiddopotamus!!
-1	My daughter was small, but this really seemed very cumbersome to use.  Didn't really see the need for this-a much better buy that my mother insisted on was the harness pillow for support.
+1	I just LOVE this Snuzzler. Keeps your newborn warm and cozy - not to mention a better fit in their carseats. My daughter who's only 2 weeks old, looks very comfortable in her car seat. Without it, she was hunched over - her neck wobbling around. I didn't feel she was safely in her carseat. She only weighed 6 pounds so the carseat was too big for her. I do recommend this product to new parents. You won't regret it! Plus you can also use this in your stroller and/or bouncers!
+1	The Snuzzler is the perfect accessory for an infant car seat, especially for newborns and preemies.  The Snuzzler is reversable for summer or winter and is adjustable as the baby grows.  Whenever the baby outgrows it, the baby is probably ready to sit in the infant seat without extra support.  This has worked so much better than rolled up towels which are constantly moving.  It is also important to note that the Snuzzler meets all official flammability requirements.  Towels do not and are usually cotton which is extremely flamible.- It is now 8 months later.  We stopped needing the snuzzler in her infant seat at about 4 months old.  We had it stored for awhile and then brought it out again to use in her high chair.
+1	My son was a big baby, checking in at over 9 pounds and 22 inches, but the headrests that came with the carseat still didn't offer enough support. We were fortunate to have received this product at our baby shower. He looked so cozy with the fleece side cuddling him and he was very well supported. Now that it's over 80 degrees, we've flipped it over to use the cooler fabric and he still loves it. My son is almost 8 weeks old, so we tried taking it out of our carseat and just using the headrest that came with the carseat. But, it still doesn't offer enough support. Once he falls asleep, his little head just hung over the side, so we put the snuzzler back in and he's much happier.It is a bit trickier to get the car seat straps safely adjusted around the support, but after a few days we had the hang of it.
+1	We are very satisfied with the Snuzzler product.  Our son is 5 days old and we have used the Snuzzler in his carseat and his bouncer.  It supports his head beautifully.  The fleece side helps keep him warm.  We would not know what to do without it. ***Update- A big plus> I have washed it several times in the washing machine then let it hang dry and it still looks great.  I am looking forward to using for our next child!
+1	I got this Snuzzler for a babyshower gift and was so excited. I soon realized that it was way to big and bulky for our newborns carseat. I took others advice and put it in the stroller, and our swing and it is great! Our little girl was born small, only 6lbs 2oz and it held her perfectly! Over all I am happy with this product!
+1	Other reviewers mentioned that this is a must for smaller babies, but our daughter was nine pounds when she was born and she was so snug and comfy in her car seat with the Snuzzler. She is almost 15 pounds now and we are still using it.Snuzzler provides the ultimate support and "hugs" the baby in all the right places, so the little one feels secure and comfortable. We also use one in the stroller - for extra padding. I like that it's adjustable and will grow with the baby, and the design allows it to be used virtually anywhere - in the car seat, stroller, swing, high chair - you name it! It may even be used as a sleep positioner in the crib to prevent the baby from rolling over.We use our Snuzzler every day and it doesn't show any wear at all. It washes well (doesn't shrink, bunch, fade or pill) and may well serve more than one baby.
+1	It is fast and works great!  It is much faster than the old fashioned way of warming bottles, and it is portable.  We've taken it out of town several times.  Plus, it doesn't leak!
-1	I wrote an earlier review giving this warmer 5 stars because it heated the bottles so fast and the cooler portion made it easy to use anywhere in the house and travel. BUT I noticed that the ON/OFF switch SPARKED EVERY TIME you turned it off.Luckily, I had kept the box so I just exchanged it for another only to discover the second did the exact same thing! This is a HUGE FIRE HAZARD! I have contacted The First Years about this problem but so far have not rec'vd a reply. I even searched for information about Recalls on this warmer but found nothing. Maybe it was just a fluke that I purchased the two out there that did this - but if I were you I wouldnt take the chance that there are more with this problem, avoiding it altogether and buy a different brand!Initially I would have recommended this warmer but now I say DONT BUY IT! The on/off switch needs to re-designed before it is safe to use. (I wouldn't be surprized if this gets recalled!)
+1	We just had a new baby boy and I feel like a new mother!  My older son is now 14 years old and boy have baby products changed since then!  I seriously considered comments and reviews when deciding which items I wanted, which I could live without, and what was an absolute must have.  So I hope you find my review just as helpful when deciding on your purchase.  I call this bottle warmer one of the best purchases we've made so far!  I read the mixed reviews on this product before purchasing it and I'm glad I ignored all the negative reviews.  I quickly learned that the problem with those used wasn't the product, it might have been "user error".  I have found this warmer to be extremely easy to use.  The trick is to play with the warmer and get the water levels right before attempting to use it.  So far we use it daily and it's always heated consistantly and quickly (1-2 mins max).  I still ALWAYS shake the bottle and check the temp before giving it to my son!
+1	This is a wonderful must-have.  I was given this as a shower gift and it has been a lifesaver.  We use it anytime we need to heat up a bottle, day or night.  We prefer to use it instead of heating the bottle in the microwave, but sometimes the bottles get too hot, and that is probably because we may have put a little too much water in the measuring tube.  But most of the time, they are just right.  We simply pour the water into the warmer unit, put in a bottle, and while we are changing her diaper, the bottle is heating.  By the time we are done changing her diaper, the bottle is ready.  We just keep the warmer in her room for convenience.  In the beginning we used, the cooler, but we kept forgetting to put the ice pack back in the freezer after she'd taken the 2nd bottle, so now we just use it for the warmer and it has truly worked out really good for us.
+1	This device is great!!! It heats the bottles to the right temp fast very fast. Easy to use. I could not live without it. The detached cooler is great for trips and family functions. Keeps the bottles cool to you are reasy for them.
+1	This warmer worked great and it was so convenient for the middle of the night feedings to not have to go up and down the stairs.  I used it for almost 3 months and then I went to the microwave.  I know everything warns you not to use the microwave but it works just fine and is much quicker.  Now that my 3 month old is sleeping through the night, I don't have to worry about the convenience factor.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this warmer.
+1	During my first pregnancy I received a Night and Day bottle warmer as a gift.  I had triplets and the Night and Day bottle warmer could not hold the number of bottles I needed at night so I ended up giving it away.  I would not recommend this product for homes with multiples.  You might be able to use it if you have twins and they only get up once during the night.When I became pregnant a second time, one of the first things I asked for was a Night and Day Bottle warmer.  There are not too many models out there.It is a very simple to use and set up.  The two water holders slide onto the side of the warmer and the cooler is placed in the back.  There are a couple of different basket holders.  One for bottles and one for jars of food.There is a chart on the side of the cooler.  You find the size bottle you are using and what type.  You fill the water to the number on the water holder.When you want to warm a bottle you dump the water into the warmer place the bottle in and hit the button.  Button will glow orange as it warms.  When it is ready the light will shut off.  Takes about 2-5 minutes.Good Features:On and Off switch on the cord.  Very nice when you have toddlers that like to push buttons.Indicator light to tell you when bottle is done.Warms a bottle in the amount of time it takes you to change the diaper.Very stable.  No tipping and not top heavy even with coolerFits many size bottles, See note below about Dr Brown's BottlesPoor Features:Water holder clips can break during shipping, inspect your warmer as soon as you buy itWater bottle for cooler, must fill with water.  Does not stay frozen for longer than 7-8 hours.Cooler lock is plastic bump.  Breaks very easily.  Cooler will no longer lock if one is missing.  Steam can get into cooler because seal is broken.  Top will not stay on if lock is broken.Will only hold 2 bottlesDr. Brown's BottlesUnscrew the top just enough so it does not have a complete seal, then warm bottle.  If you do not unscrew the top or remove the straw, the formula during heating will rise up the straw and flow into the warmer.When I opened the box I discovered one of the water holders was broken.  It was just the plastic clip on the side.  Then a few nights later I noticed that the lock on the cooler was broken.  I emailed First Years and told them about my broken pieces.  I never received a written response but a week later a new cooler and water holder arrived in the mail.The Night and Day Bottle warmer is a must have for Families that have 2 story homes or very large homes.  It is very convenient to remove the bottle from the cooler, place in warmer hit start.  Better than going to the kitchen and warming a bottle.*update* 8 oz Dr Brown's Bottles will not fit into the cooler unless you remove the cap.
-1	The only reason why I'm giving this a 1 star is not for the convenience it provides to others, but because it is so not necessary to have...another baby product on the market that is not needed. I, being a first time mom, wanted all the baby products out there! Well...I too read all the reviews for this item, registered for it, and received it as a gift. Well...we found absolutely no use for it. If you start your baby with warming his milk, then you're only getting him use to it. I'm sure most everyone either receives the Arrowhead or Sparkletts (or other) bottled water in their homes...well, the water is already at room tempreature...no need to "warm" it up in the bottle warmer device...just add your formula in the bottle, shake and give to your baby! It's already leukewarm. The only time I warm up the bottle is if it's been in the fridge...at that point, I just run it under hot water to warm it up. My baby does not have 5+ mins to wait...nor do I! Save your $$ and/or those of your friends/family who get it for you!
+1	The bottle warmer is a must have for new moms.  It's such a pain to heat a bottle in boiling water - and it takes so long.  This bottle warmer will heat your bottle in 1-2 minutes -- it's quick and easy.  The product has held up nicely and doesn't take up too much counter space.
+1	I wish I would have purchased this bottle warmer from the very beginning.  I purchased the Avent Bottle Warmer because I was using Avent Bottles but I recently had to switch bottles and had to purchase a bottle warmer to accommodate those bottles.  Little did I know, this bottle warmer works well with Avent bottles as well.  The only very small problem is that the numbers on the measuring cups rub off after a week or so which makes it hard to fill them with the correct amout of water for your size bottles.  I guess I will have to guestimate at this point.
-1	I just don't like this product.  Basically it is boiling the water and the bottom of the bottle gets really hot and if you use the Vent Air bottle the water drips out of the bottom is it is really hot.  I just started using the mircrowave and it seem to heat faster this way.  It takes forever for the formula to get warm by this product.
+1	My children are 12 years apart and I wish they would have had this item with my first. It is so easy to use and makes those middle of the night feedings just a little more tolerable. If you get into a routine: ( wake up place the bottle in the warmer change the diaper the bottle is done by the time you are and has even had time to cool for a moment). I only had one problem with getting the bottles 2 hot but that was my fault from heating them twice. Go figure. I had a c-section and we lived in a 2 story house, what trips this saved my husband from going downstairs all night was well worth the money.
+1	A bottle warmer has many uses.  The first and most obvious use is the fact that you can have a bottle warming while you're changing your baby's diaper, getting them dressed etc...While some will complain that it takes 5 minutes, I find that to be a gross over estimate.  It takes not quite 2 minutes from refridgerator to warm.  If it truly took 5 minutes my guess is that too much water was being put into the resevoir.The next great use is the fact that it's easy and so any Dad - new or experienced - can figure out how to use it to help out.  It's extremely easy to use so it can even be easily used in the middle of the night.The one weakness that I found has to do with warming up breast milk that's been frozen.  It seems to have some sort of timer that times how long the water in the resevoir has boiled to not let the milk get too hot.  If breast milk has not had an opportunity to thaw out in the fridge yet it will obviously take more than just 1 press of the button for the milk to thaw and be warmed up.  The problem is that even though there's still ice in the bottle the water will be warm and so the heating element that heats the water will shut off after 10 seconds.  What I had to do was shake the bottle to more evenly distribute the temperature through out the bottle and add more cool water to the resevoir 3-4 times.  This situation is easily fixed however by remembering (easier said than done when you aren't sleeping much!!) to take out a bottle 12-18 hours in advance.Overall, great product, great value and a must have.  I would have given it 5 stars if there was a way to set some sort of control to tell it that the bottle is full of frozen liquid.
-1	I use platex nurser with the disposable liners, and when I tried to heat it in the warmer sometimes it would be cold other times it would get so warm that the liner would leak. I would not recommend buying this item. It is much easier just to the bottle in a glass on warm water
+1	Ok this item is something that has made life so much easier for us.  Firstly let me say that we tried A LOT of different bottles to find the right suction for my son and went through Avent, Gerber Nuk, Evenflo, Playtex with the liners and eventually settled on Playtex Ventaire.  All these bottles warmed up quickly, quietly and beautifully in this warmer.  It says it takes 5 minutes, for a full 8oz maybe but with a newborn the bottles warm up in next to no time at all.  All you do is just put the water in, snap on the switch, let the bottle sizzle away for a really short while and you can feed with ease.  I keep a small jug of water next to my bed as well in case I need extra I don't have to go to the bathroom to get more.  The water holders are such a bonus as there is no having to get enough light to look inside to see the "fill line" or anything like that.  It heats pretty evenly and I would recommend this item to anyone wanting a bottle warmer.  We usually just leave the bottles at room temperature, seeing as it's winter, and just warm them from then.  Well worth the money!
+1	I ended up purchasing the Playtex Nurser bottle with the Drop-ins after trying various other bottles that my baby wouldn't drink from. These nipples were a lifesaver and allowed my baby to easily switch between breast and bottle. They are MUCH softer than silicone nipples, which allows for an easier transition. I recommend these to everyone with a baby!
+1	I never thought I could feel so much affection towards a latex nipple.  That was, until I met Playtex.  Oh, I could bore you with the details of what i like to call "the bottle wars" that took place in our home last Spring, but I will spare you.  What I will tell you is that when we discovered the Playtex drop-ins WITH, and ONLY WITH, the latex nipples, a cease fire took place and peace was restored to our home.  You're going "this woman is nuts,"  but no, these nipples here allowed me to, oh I don't know, take a quick jaunt to Starbucks and the store sans baby because finally she would take a bottle from someone else!!! I like to call these "gas station bottles," which isn't fair, but in some ways an appropriate description: You can find the bottles ANYWHERE.  They aren't snooty like Dr. Browns or the glass ones, but like I and so many of my mama friends have discovered, the reason YOUR moms used them on you and they are still available is because they WORK and WORK WELL.  GO old school, get these bottles and the latex nipples.  And thank me later.
+1	This was our 6th bottle/nipple to try on our daughter who refused to take the bottle.  It finally worked!!!  And the whole Playtex system is so easy and convenient to use.  I wish I had started off with these and not wasted so much time and money on the other fancy and hard-to-clean bottles.
-1	These nipples certainly weren't &#34;fast&#34; for anything but water. Formula barely comes through. Slower than the slow-flow! The other Playtex nipples I've bought aren't BPA free and they work MUCH better.
+1	I got these latex nipples to have 'spare parts' for my vintage baby bottle collection.  It was a decent price, and saved me a trip to go look for them :)
+1	Daughter strongly prefers to breast feed.  We went through numerous different bottle/nipple combinations before finally settling on playtex drop-in nursers and these latex nipples.  They're the only bottle/nipple that she will take (won't even take the silicone version of these nipples).  Now every baby is different so this may not be the magic combination for you, and even now she still has her days when she'll reject the bottle, but this was a great solution for us.  If you have a picky baby that won't take any bottles, I would recommend trying these out.  Only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is the quality control is poor; out of the first 4 nipples that we purchased had 2 nonfunctional ones (there was no hole); I now check each nipple first by making sure I can squeeze water out before using it.
+1	We had a hard time getting our son to take a bottle, but the latex nipples on the Playtex nurser did the trick!  Someone had recommended the latex nipples to me because they are softer than silicone.  We started him on these, and once he was used to it, transitioned to the silicone Playtex nipples.  Great product, especially for the bottle-wary baby!
+1	These are the first VentAire bottles I've used, and I'm impressed!  The air bubbles really do vent out!  My baby wasn't too great about taking a bottle before, but he actually started drinking from these.  He seems to like the nipple.  I like the angled shape of the bottle because it makes for a more comfortable feeding.The one draw back to these bottles is that there are two extra parts to clean.  But if I'm washing a bottle anyway, it's really not a big deal.  I also like that the bottom comes off because It allows for better cleaning.
+1	I love these bottles. My NB became accustomed to the Breastflow type so it was hard to switch him, but we had to due to such bad gas problems. The only problem I found with these were the nipples.. We got a fast-flow and even though he's a savage eater, it was just a little too fast for him so he gave up completely. Our babysitter got over it fast so she went to walmart and bought some slower-flowing nipples (same brand, same fit) and is swearing by them. I BF my baby, but when we wean him we'll be sure to get a slower-flow nipple top and just use the fast-flow for his rice cereal/BM concoctions. Definitely would buy again if I hadn't already stocked up, haha!One thing to note:: These bottles DO NOT work if you're trying to switch parts with any other brand.(which is why the docking of 1*) It's not as wide a neck as Breastflow and Gumdrop, and not small enough to fit standard hospital bottles and Medela brand. If you get this brand of bottle, you'll only be able to use the corresponding parts.For us it's no biggie, it works the best and has so far proven to be a pretty decent investment.
+1	Baby has feeding issues so we have to feed him in an upright position (the NICU feed position)  Other bottles were hard to use in this position, but the angle of the ventaire makes it so easy.  The bottles have 5 pieces (body, nipple, collar, base and silicone vent) They are easy to clean and assemble, however if you do not dry the pieces well water will drip from around the bottom, or the collar.These are all white so great for boy or girl.  I did however prefer the brighter colors that the old ventaire bottles came in.(deep blues, purples, etc)
+1	When I first saw this, I was sure that it would leak, but it just seemed like such an innovative idea that I bought one anyway. The bottle is incredibly easy to clean because both ends can be removed.I unscrewed the nipple ring and the bottom of the bottle. I was so sure that it would leak if I put anything liquid in it. I filled the bottle full of water and tossed it around on a white sheet to see if it leaked. It didn't, but I still wasn't sure. So, I washed the bottle in hot water. I've noticed that some bottles leak after being washed. Then, I tried the sheet experiment again. It didn't leak. This bottle is 9 months old and still hasn't leaked.I also liked how these bottles were wide and took similar nipples as the disposable bottles from Playtex, which makes switching back and forth from the Playtex disposable and reusable bottles much easier and causes less nipple confusion.
+1	I use ONLY these with both of my children.  If you are looking for a slow flow bottles, those are the ones. I have tried several brands,  like born free and dr Brown. Even though Born free claim the nipple is slow flow, but my infant just chokes with milk... Vent Air is easy to assemble and to clean. The angle makes it easier to hold the bottle.  Dr Brown has too many parts to clean and to store.  Overall, i really like these bottles, and strongly recommend them.
+1	These bottles work very well as long as all parts are totally dry.  I've had them leak several times but it's been because I haven't let the latex valve on the base air dry completely.  I use them at home but would not be confident traveling with them.
+1	I can't speak to the 'science' behind the design and if the 'ventAire' does what it claims to. But they are a good well-designed bottle that our daughter likes. They are different then most bottles as there is not only the nipple and nipple ring on top but 2 pieces on the bottom that comprise the 'ventAire' system. I thought at first this would be a hassle but it is not much extra work to clean (more pieces to keep track of though). In fact it makes cleaning the bottle itself possible with a sponge since with the bottom and top pieces taken off you can put a sponge in from either end.If you are new to bottles though I do highly recommend this as an essential piece of baby equipmentOXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, OrangeThe bottle brush has gotten us up to 15 months, could not have done bottles without it. It helps for these as well although it is not essential as it is for regular bottles. In the end our daughter took right to these and the nipples on the 9 ounce ones seem to flow well for an older baby. If you are willing to keep track of a couple or more pieces per bottle as a good trade off for the 'ventAire' system then these are a good bottle choice.
+1	The nipple is one that got rave reviews.  It is not difficult for a baby to drink from the nipple which is a good and reasonable size.I like the way the bottles come in sections which make clean up jobs easier.  You don't have residual feedings left in these bottles for that very reason.The angled shape make it easy for whoever is holding the bottle.  The weight is more or less evenly distributed and leakage, if any is minimal.  This also results in less gas and burping and a cleaner feeding time all around.
+1	While my first son almost never spit up, my second spits up ALL the time. Nothing out of the ordinary, but still a good bit. We've only been using these a few weeks, but he hasn't spit up near as much. It may be because he's getting older and eating more baby food and all, but I'll gladly give credit to the bottles!I'm going to point out a few things about these bottles that we've observed and you can decide whether that part is positive or negative.-After using "straight" bottles, these do take a bit of getting used to. Since the top is curved, it's easier to spill the formula if you don't turn it with the lower side towards you when pouring it in.-The small bottle is 6 ounces as opposed to 5 ounces on all the other bottles we've used. At first, I was really excited about this, but you still can't make a 6 ounce bottle using powdered formula. There's not enuogh room to mix it up. So, you can still only use it as a 4 ounce bottle IF using powdered formula. There's plenty of room if you're using liquid or breast milk for 6 ounces. (This set only has the 9 ounce bottles, though).-There's 6 pieces to put together for each bottle. Two pieces go together at the bottom, and 3 at the top. I'll admit sometimes it gets to be a pain with so many peices, but most bottles these days have a lot of pieces.-There's different colors, so there's a variety. I like that the colors are gender neutral. When you're putting the bottles together it does take a little more time trying to match up the tops and bottoms according to color, but that part isn't absolutely necessary. I like them to match, though.-The "slow" nipple is VERY slow! The "fast" nipple is VERY fast. I would prefer and in between. If you're using breast milk, the "slow" nipple is perfect. If you put cereal in the bottle, the fast nipple is perfect for that. It's fast enough that you don't have to widen the hole or anything. (I think this set only comes with "fast" nipples).Overall, we are VERY pleased with them! Even my husband is happy with them. :)
+1	I think this is my baby's favorite bottle nipple shape.Like many others, I was worried these bottles would leak but they don't! Hurray!I really wanted to try these to see if they'd cut down on burping. They don't appear to do so, at least not significantly, but my baby is not exclusively bottle-fed.Pros:- They don't leak!- They are super-easy to get very clean (quickly!) because the bottom comes off. This is great when I'm out and about without my bottle brush.- The shape of the bottle is easy for me to hold and for the baby too although the 9 oz size is very unwieldy for young babies.- DISHWASHER SAFE!Cons:- Water will get into the bottom cap if you warm your bottles in water (but once you realize that it's easy to shake it out).- Can't tell if the bottle cuts down on burping and gas.- I wish this set came with an extra vent disk and nipple like the multi-size set.
+1	I don't particularly understand the technology behind this model of baby bottles, but I do know that I see plenty of bubbles end up in the bottles while feeling my daughter. They are always at the nipple of the bottle. Does this happen to anyone else? I normally use the drop-ins bottles and I don't prefer one bottle over the other. I notice the same amount of burping and fussiness regardless of whichever bottle I use. I do like that the bottle is bent so it is easier to feed my baby. Also, I didn't notice at first that the pack came with fast flow nipples, but that was my fault. I thought something was wrong at first but it was just the wrong nipple, as my baby still requires the slow-flow ones.
+1	WE have a 3 month old that is now being introduced to bottles now that my wide is returning to work.  The vent Aire bottles seemed like a good choice since we've had to get rid of older bpa bottles that the other kids used...  The work as advertised,  all WE have a 3 month old that is now being introduced to bottles now that my wide is returning to work.  The vent Aire bottles seemed like a good choice since we've had to get rid of older bpa bottles that the other kids used...  The work as advertised,  allowing air to replace the milk volume a the baby eats....removing the vacuum pressure from the bottle.Cons:_you can't warm a bottle in hot water, since the bottom isn't water proof_more pieces to maker sure are clean, dry, and assembled correctlyI probably would not use one as a carry bottle,  but for filling right before using...Other than that...my son sees to burp less with them, so they are working as advertised.
+1	Highly recommend buying online from Amazon the prices in the store are a lot higher these are good bottles cause you can actually hear the air coming out bottom less colic, and you can take them apart so your getting a cleaner bottle and can order different flow nipples . Recommend this item .
+1	We love these bottles!  They do create bubbles when baby is drinking, but the bubbles dissipate almost immediately.  The bottles have reduced his gas and they seem to be the only nipples he can suck on without bending or compressing them.  That said, we've had difficulty finding replacement nipples for them!  The stores in our area sell only the stage 2 Vent Aire Natural Shape nipples.  The regular stage 1 Vent Aire nipples are too small for these bottles.  Still, I'd recommend these bottles highly.
-1	Bought these because my boy has acid reflux and is supposed to eat upright.  I was hopful they would work well.  However they leak.  No matter what I tried they leaked.  Had others try them for me, they leaked for them.  They are not worth the money, I won't even attempt to sell them at a yard sale because I dont want to burden anyone with the frustration of a leaky bottle.  DO NOT BUY.
+1	Baby is not nearly as gassy since we switched to these bottles. Also very easy to clean.
+1	My son is 3 months old and from birth has been extremely gassy. He also has reflux so we are constantly dealing with spitting up, burping issues, and excess gas. I originally used the Dr. Browns bottles because I had heard SO many good things about them. Well, Dr. Brown's bottles did not work for us. I recently decided to try the VentAire bottle, based on a friend who was happy with them. As soon as I switched I noticed a major reduction in my sons gas. I also immediately noticed that he was burping better, both during and after a feeding. I highly recommend these bottles, especially if you are dealing with spitting up and gas issues. Putting the bottles together is an extra step, but a lot less time consuming than putting together the Dr. Browns bottles, and it's well worth the effort.
+1	Now that I have your attention, I like these bottles a whole bunch. I have used Avent (review) Dr. Brown's (review not yet written) and these. These are awesome! Just unscrew and clean all parts (which is not require lots of time, patience, and tools)! Even your husband can figure it out! Now that is easy if a man can figure out the fine art of bottle assembly and dissasembly. The wider bottle is easier for an adult to hold but seems heavier if your baby tries to. Overall, 5 stars
+1	these bottles were recommended by our pediatricianthey really do help lessen swallowed air and in turn baby gaswhich helps lessen spit up
+1	I got these because I babysit my nephew who is breast fed. His mother started classes and is away for 9 hours a day. He has been very fussy about "bottle" substitutions for mom, but he adjusted quite quickly to these nipples. While they aren't mom, he is consolable and accepting of this system!  Certainly makes feeding time while mom's away a whole lot less stressful!!
+1	We've used these and the AVENT bottles. We like both, but happen to use these more now because we lost our fast nipples for the AVENT.My little one is now 6 months old, and up until recently was both bottle and breastfed. We tried her first bottle at about 4 weeks and she never had any trouble switching back and forth once I went back to work. These have also seemed to work great for keeping down burps and spitup, and though there is one extra piece as compared to the AVENT, it's not a big deal and the pieces are all large enough that they don't fall through the weave in a bottle dishwasher basket. (They also give you extras of the most easily lost part, the vent cover thing.)We needed some more of the larger size bottles since she is now having 6oz per feeding, and putting 6 oz in the 6oz bottles is a bit tight. We also wanted some more fast nipples, but I wasn't sure what came with this set (it didn't seem to say anywhere). Well, we got the "neutral" colors (green, blue, yellow) and only fast nipples, which is perfect. (For some reason, I can't find a reasonably price set of just the fast nipples for these anywhere.)
+1	This is the only bottle/nipple our breastfed baby would take expressed breastmilk in.  She flat out refused all others.  We use these Blue nipples now that my daughter is older (thicker plastic), but used the clear Natural nurser nipples when she was younger and the product still worked and didn't leak.
+1	I tried the regular version of these bottles, too.I babysit a friend's 5 mo old boy, he tends to spit up.  I thought these would be perfect to try with him.  He definitely spits up alot less with these bottles, there are far fewer bubbles in the bottle, too.  I gave his mom the pack of regular bottles and I keep these at my house to use with him when  he's here.  She loves the bottles, too, and says these are all she uses now.  It definitely makes for far less laundry when the baby doesn't spit up nearly as much!  Personally I prefer the wide bottles, they seem easier to hold but that could be because I'm dealing with my 2 kids at the same time as the baby.I used a much more expensive brand with my last baby who is 4 now.  Wish I had known these existed, they're far easier to clean and much easier on the wallet.  :-)
+1	I tried the orginal VentAires to help my baby with gas, but he didn't seem to like those nipples at all, so when I found these I bought them right away.  He loves these and does so much better with the nipples.  He also gets less gas.  I find them easier to put together and clean then the regular VentAires also.
-1	I can't even use this bottles yet because they arrived with FAST flow nipples, although the picture clearly shows a box with SLOW flow ones! Annoying, inconvenient, and a hassle. Thanks amazon. Urgh.
+1	My husband and I were beside ourselves with our newborn trying to find a bottle that she would like and wouldn't create extra air. She was very gassy!We tried everything... Dr. Browns, Tommy Tippee, and Gerber and none of them worked... plus the Dr. B and Tommy Tippee are much more expensive. She finally liked the Playtex Ventaire!! The key is the WIDE nipples... I am nursing as well and you have to get the wide nipples.The only thing is the fast nipples (which is what they come with) are way too fast... (we started her on these bottles at 4wks... I had to buy the wide MEDIUM flow WIDE nipples and they work great). She's now 7 wks and the fast nipples are still too fast... we just tried this am! Good luck to you but definitely give these a try.
-1	We are loyal to the Soothie line of bottles and so forth, they have always worked well for us. I tried these hoping that it would help my baby sleep better with less gas but there were several problems right away. She didn't seem to like the shape, and it was kind of awkward for her. It was really hard to get the top just so, so it wouldn't leak. And the bottle will not fit in most warmers. I wouldn't choose this one again.
+1	would NEVER buy any other bottle but these. I have 12 of them. they were great. I have some of the more $$ ones and those leaked. Not playtex wide ventAire. THey were excelent. great if you are breastfeeding (wide nipple only). I realized that you can never have too many bottles with my boy!!! :)
+1	My seven-month-old has been bottle fed since about 1-week-old. We started with the Playtex Drop-ins.  I have been very happy with those bottles, but sometimes I hate dealing with the inserts.  These bottles are the perfect companion.  The nipples are interchangeable, so my son has no problem with the bottle change-up.I was really hoping the bottle would be easier for my son to hold on to since it is angled, but I think he just likes me holding it, so he has yet to hold the bottle himself.  I do find it much easier for me to hold when he is laying down because I can move around and it fits perfectly under my chin or it sits at he correct angle without me having to hold it at all unlike a straight bottle that falls over easily.The bottle unscrews at both the top and the bottom.  The bottom has a seal in it that pops out easily and is simple to clean.  They wash up quickly and I usually put them in my Avent microwave sterilizer.My one complaint is that the bottles come with fast-flow nipples.  My son is a medium-flow bottle eater.  Fast is just too fast for him.  He moved up to the medium at 2.5 months, but I don't see him moving up any time soon. I would prefer they come with medium since that would be used more frequently to begin with when moving up to the larger bottles.Overall, a great bottle.  I suggest picking up some medium-flow nipples if your little one has been using slow-flow since fast-flow can be a big jump.
-1	These were great at first, we loved the size and "tilt" feature. However, we stopped using them because nipples would clog.  We also use some formula that might be clog-prone, but we didn't have this problem with our other brand of bottles.
+1	We've been relatively happy with these bottles, but I think we may have gone with something different if we had done any research.  We got these from the lactation consultant's office a day after our daughter was born in a panic of needing to buy something.  Our daughter was breast fed mostly, but used these a few times a week.Venting system: I do hear air going back in the back end, so I suppose it is doing its job to some degree, but I also see air going back in through the nipple.Ease of washing: I dont think the five parts are all that difficult to wash/keep track of.  The bottom stopper does take a bit of attention to make sure formula isnt remaining there after washing though.  Dont use a bottle brush and put it through the bottom stopper... it can cause it to tear and leak.  We've generally handwashed the bottles and parts, but have put them through the dishwasher with success.Leaking: We ususally have at least one bottle a week that leaks.  We havent been able to identify the exact cause, because as far as we can see, they're clean and assembled correctly.  The only time we had a consistent leak to troubleshoot, it was due to the bottom stopper having a tear in the inner ring.Replacement parts: I'm really confused as to why the bottom stoppers are not available in most stores.  Also, why do they sell three packs of bottles and only two packs of nipples?  So we have nine bottles and eight nipples.  Silly.Having not used anything else, I can't really compare. Parents in our parent's group seem to all use something different and they all seem happy with their choice whether it was the Dr. Browns, Medela, etc.
+1	I absolutely love these bottles. When I brought my newborn home I wasn't sure what to use. I knew that Playtex was good but I had problems telling how many oz. of water was in the bottle as according to the scoops of formula. When I found the VentAire collection I thought it was great because both my husband and myself had problems with ear infections as children. He refused to take the regular VentAire so I tried the Natural Shape and have never gone back. It is the best bottle that I have ever seen.
+1	These bottles really work! I was skeptical at first, but my son actually seems to have less gas after eating from these bottles. I found the same results from Avent bottles, but those cost more. The only downside to these is that each bottle has 5 parts, so if you don't have a dishwasher they would be pain to clean. You should also know that if you plan to pump into these bottles you will need an adapter.
+1	I was happy to try these Playtex VentAire Natural Shape bottle's for my daughter. Although she is older now (not a newborn) I have been quite tired and upset with Dr. Brown's bottles that we were using since her birth. They have discolored greatly, yucky stuff was caked on inside the inner tubing, very hard to clean out, but most of all they constantly leaked after a month or two of owning. I replaced them twice and each time they have leaked from the screw cap area. If you make them to tight they leak, to loose they leak, very fine line.... soo when I had the opportunity to try these out and had something to compare them to I was quite happy to do so.Right off the bat I liked the design of them, and the way the top was angled. The nipples are natural shaped and my daughter went from the old bottles to these without any hesitation or trouble to the nipple. In fact she likes them better and seeks them out when wanting her bottle. The state 2 nipples are fast flow and for her were perfect. I like how the bottle and the top come off so you can clean the entire bottle with easy, rather then a fight. Most importanly though they did not leak at all. The last thing you want is to travel and have your bottle leak, or spill coming out of the cap areas. Of course flip a bottle upside down most will leak from the nipple. But none should leak from the screw cap area, and I was happy these did not leak. We have used them well over a month now, going on two and love them!feeds your baby with virtually no bubbles and less gas and spit ups. It has a unique leak-proof bottom vent that controls bubbles and an angled 9-oz. bottle that promotes semi-upright feeding and deters ear infections. Natural shape nipple is designed for switching between bottle and breast. Safe for breast milk and 2-end opening for easy and complete cleaning. Includes stage 2 fast flow nipples. Comes in light purple, light blue and light green colors. Made of hypoallergenic plastic. Imported. 6.75Hx2.25" dia. Colors May VaryDesigned for babies switching between breast and bottle or transitioning from breast to bottle feedingVentAire Advanced bottles are easy to clean and come with a leak-proof, breakproof guaranteeBPA freeMade by Playtex - A leader in infant feedingColors vary: Boy-white/green/blue, Girl-white/yellow/pink, Neutral-white/green/yellow1. This is the only nipple my new baby likes. She didn't like the nipples that her older twin brother/sister used. Making the transition from breast to bottle was fairly simple, as long as I heat the bottle of milk up first! lol2. Bottle is easier to clean. Sure it comes in pieces, but I like the fact that because the bottom comes apart, I can really get the bottles clean. The bottom of the conventional bottles would never get quite that clean, even when I use those bottle brushes. The brushes don't get into the crevices on the bottom so there's that thin layer of dried milk or something that's always there.3. Ergonomically correct in shape. Easy for me to hold, and for the baby to hold as well. Since the bottle curves upwards, the weight of the bottle is dispursed centrally so the baby has an easier time holding it.4. It seems like I don't have to burp her so often, and she doesn't spit up.5. Doesn't leak if you have it screwed on correctly.
+1	I love the Ventaire line of baby bottles but these are by far my favorite. The wide bottle makes it easier for baby to hold on to while the feeder is also able to hold on to assist the baby. I don't think Ventaire can get any better than these!
+1	This is the only bottle I've used for my baby. It keeps air from her tummy and ventilates perfectly. I've been using it since day one after being a nanny for many years and seeing how different bottles act differently. A lot of moms who don't have colicky babies use the bottle because it's such a trustworthy product. The ventilation system helps keep my baby's acid reflux under control. Plus, the bottom comes out so you can just use a sponge to clean the bottle. You don't have to use a bottle brush if you don't need to. If you do use a bottle brush (I do sometimes) you don't get sprayed with soap or water as the opening to the bottles are wide enough to prevent the mess. They came very quickly, well packaged. I shopped around and every time I do I end up coming back to Amazon. Excellent product!
+1	My daughter (5 months old) has been exclusively breastfed since she was born because we've been unable to find a bottle that she likes-we tried Dr. Brown, evenflo, Gerber NUK, pretty much every kind we could find, and still no luck.  I thought we'd give these a try since the nipple is wide and short (more similar to the "real thing") and she will now take a bottle! In addition to the nipple being good, they have the air reducer (attached to the bottom) that keeps her from getting gassy and helps keep the liquid in the bottle flowing smoothly without bubbling.  They come apart easily (into 4 pieces: nipple, bottle, bottom air vent, bottom ring to hold the air vent on) and are a lot easier to clean than some of the other types of bottles we've had that have a lot of smaller pieces.  This set comes with 3 bottles and 3 nipples. Overall, I'm VERY satisfied with these and would DEFINITELY recommend these bottles to any nipple picky baby!
+1	There are so many types and styles and brands of bottles on the market now that it's hard to know which to try and use - often it's dictated by what your baby chooses and works best for them.  We tried many styles/brands of bottles and the Playtex VentAire bottles worked best for us and our daughter - we definitely noticed a lot less spitting up when we used these bottles.The design of the bottle easily reduces the amount of air that baby consumes, and when assembled properly there are no issues with leaks whatsoever.  The wider nipple base makes it easier for babies who are transitioning from breast to bottle, and you can purchase nipples with a different flow rate so you don't have to purchase new bottles as your baby's needs advance.I love that Playtex now makes their products BPA free, it's just one more thing to love about their products.As with any of the newer style bottles that are designed to reduce spit-up/colic/gas there are a few extra bottle parts to clean and assemble - with these bottles it is he vent piece that goes in the bottom of the bottle, and the plastic ring that holds it into place.  This is a minor draw-back really as it only takes a moment to clean these, and I actually like that it allows me to get the bottle brush all the way through the body of the bottle and clean it thoroughly.  Any bottle that does not have an opening at both ends really limits how clean you are able to get it.Overall we are very happy with these - they're affordable and work very well for us - highly recommended.
+1	First off, this particular bottle set came with fast flow nipples.  Slow flow nipples can be bought as an add-on item here, and I couldn't find slow flow nipples at any of my local stores.  As far as I can see, there aren't medium flow nipples for this bottle.  My baby had mild colic (unable to BF, so he's a formula baby) and after trying Avent, Evenflo and MAM, found that these bottom-venting bottles worked the best for reducing air bubbles in my baby.  This is my third baby.
+1	I've used these bottles for all three of my kids as they are the only thing I've found that most closely resemble the breast. We've all read about nipple confusion and it concerned me since my kids attend daycare and I still nurse when I'm with them. All three of my kids took to this bottle with no issues and I like that you can take them completely apart for cleaning. The two size option is good as your baby grows and his appetite follows.
+1	These are my babies preferred bottles. He has GERD and these don't bother him. We tried the regular size but when he was younger it created some bad habits for when he nursed.these wide nipples keeping him latching correctly. The down side is there are 6 pieces per bottle, the upside is that they're easy to clean thoroughly
-1	Dr. Brown's bottles didn't solve the gas issue, but neither did Playtex Vent Aire.  Aside from the fancy name, Playtex did not reduce baby's painful gas (from breast milk).  Also, the bottom can leak if not forcefully tightened - I lost 2 ounces of precious breast milk with these lousy Playtex bottles which were recommended by the women's clinic.  For people who produce little breast milk, losing 2 ounces is like losing large 24 karat gold nuggets in the sink.  The number of parts to clean is comparable to Dr. Brown's bottles, but Dr. Brown's bottles at least provides you with a cleaning brush to clean the interior nipple; with Playtex, you're out of luck.  I think that I heard the venting taking place ONCE when Playtex Vent Aire was dry.  Since then, even when dry, I rarely hear the venting of air.  All Playtex does is make you vent your frustrations in the product reviews.
-1	I bought these bottles for my baby who is a big spitter.  They haven't helped at all, and one of them leaks like crazy all over the place.  I will be calling Playtex to request a refund.
+1	These are great baby bottles. My child has not had much gas since using this product. It is easy to clean as the parts come apart simply.  The angled neck is easy for me to hold while my baby is sitting up and prevents excessive gas in her stomach. 9oz is a good size bottle for growing babies and their tremendous appetites. Also, it's a great price compared to other well-known BPA free bottles (some of which were $10 per bottle).
+1	This set is great for a baby that is a few months old and is drinking more.  I received the neutral kit that included green and yellow bottles that would be appropriate for either a boy or girl. You get three 9 ounce bottles with fast flow nipples.  I have the newborn Playtex kit and continue to use the slow flow nipples because my baby is a fast eater and this helps her slow down. The nipples are also supposed to be naturally shaped to aid in breastfeeding, but my baby is exclusively fed pumped milk, so I cannot attest to that ability.The bottles are different because of the Ventaire technology. The bottom of the bottle twists off and a rubber vent fits inside. Make sure you twist the bottom on correctly, or milk will leak. They are a little stiff, but after more use it is easier to twist them off and on. Tiny holes in the bottom of the bottle allow air to escape, so your baby is not taking in extra air while eating. I saw bubbles popping and could hear the air escaping while my baby ate. Very cool.The bottles are shaped with a angle which allows for mothers to hold the baby in a more upright position while eating. This helps reduce gas and supposedly colic. It comes into narrow sides that the baby can grip when it is able.All of the bottles come with caps that fit very tightly, making transporting milk easier. Cleaning is easy, just twist off the top and bottom and remove the nipples and vents.  All parts have held up well through multiple washings.I would highly recommend these bottles. I have also used Avent, and they are good, but I do believe the Ventaire technology has made my baby less gassy and less fussy.
+1	Reviews on baby bottles are wide ranging. What works for some babies doesn't always work for others. All I can say is that these have been perfect for us. No spills. No bad seals. Slow / medium / fast nipples have brought our nine month old along perfectly. I would rate the VentAire system 6 stars if I could.
-1	These bottles are horrible, first I got only two of this brand because of an emergency since I've always used Dr. Browns but they got contaminated in the dishwasher, so I had to run and get at least two of this meanwhile cause Dr. Browns wide neck are hard to find at retailers in my area, so we used these two bottles for 2 days first they come with fast flow wich is Waaay to fast for my little guy and I would say any other baby younger than 6 months old, so I decided to get two nipples medium flow, guess what still fast, specially if You have a gassy baby, then in the last try I got the slow flow and guess what again, tooooo slow, It was like a nightmare, I had to use the small 4ozs Dr. Browns I had at home wich my baby is already drinking 5 ozs so... These Playtex bottles leak horrible, and when you place them in the bottle warmer even worse because they get water in middle of the bottom rim, so they will be leaking anyways, for the amount of parts to clean up, I did not mind I'm used to it, cause I've always used Dr. Browns wich have several parts, these Playtex bottles got my baby full of gas wich defeats the porpouse of them bottles, they make so much bubbles in the nipples you can see and hear them, and the last thing is the nipple collapses so bad my baby stoped getting the flow and the nipples are really hard. bottom line, I ordered my 3 set of Dr. Browns wide neck shipping next day and I'll be ordering a second set very soon. Dr. B best bottles ever specially for gassy babies.
+1	This is an excellent product that works as advertised.  The bottles don't leak, they're easy to clean, and the nipple is much better than most other baby bottles.  They also have a nice shape and they look pretty nice too.My one major complaint is about the way the product comes packaged.  It does not include extra nipples.  Basically this product gives you three 9 ounce bottles for about $12 (current price).  For only $20, you can get thePlaytex VentAire ADVANCED BPA Free Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set, which includes FIVE bottles, several extra nipples of different sizes, extra bottle caps, and extra vent disks.  The newborn starter kit is a much better value.  On the other hand, if you just want a few bottles plain and simple, this is definitely the product to buy.  Very pleased.
+1	I love the Vent-air bottles - tthat has been all we have been using for months now. I bought 1 of these becasue my son used to use Avents. he hated the nipple on the bottle. The bottle itself is fine. I love how it comes apart becasue it makes it so easy to clean. It is kind of hard to hold becasue it is so wide though. I can't take off too many stars for my son's personal preference but just because a baby likes one natural nipple doesn't mean he will like another.
+1	I started with Dr. Browns bottles but since I don't have a dishwasher I was ready to shoot myself when cleaning them. These are so much better.Super easy to clean (I just soak everything in the sink with hot water, dish soap and a little white vinegar) and the bent angle has been great. My baby is a super fast eater and I can actually slow him down by twisting the bottle while in his mouth after a few gulps and letting him suck on the empty nipple, then twist back again to give him a little more, repeat the process until he's done. He has a fit if you take the bottle out of his mouth. I thought that would make him super gassy but it hasn't at all.I haven't had any leaks (I have 12 bottles) and I even use a warmer although they recommend not using one. I found the condensation from the warmer does collect in the bottom lid gap but I just cap the bottle, turn upside and tap the bottom on a kitchen towel to get the excess water out.Highly recommend these if you have a fast eater!
+1	I'm having a baby girl but wanted a different color since there is so much pink in her closet so didn't want any more pink. Decided to go with the Sage and it looked like a light green online but when we received it, it was a different darker green than what is shown. Besides the color I'd recommend this product. I have quite a few clothes that needed sorting and baby isn't due for another 8 weeks but once baby gets here I didn't want hubby to just go in and pick ANYTHING, thus the need for clothes organizers. I'm sure if it wasn't for husbands there really would be no need for these. :)
+1	I do enjoy this, as it enhances the organization of baby's closet. I just didn't realize that I'd probably be putting most of baby's clothes in the dresser at first...so there's not much in the closet to actually organize. I have also since seen some pretty neat do-it-yourself ideas to achieve the same goal that you could come up with.As for the actual product, it comes with 5 hanging tags and then a bunch of label stickers to stick on them. (The labels being: Newborn, 3 month, 6 month, etc...up to 24 month.) So even though there's only 5 tags, you can put a new sticker over top of the old one as baby grows. The tags are also reversible and can be labeled on each side.
+1	Its everything I was expecting! I loved how its really easy to just peel off the sticker sizes and could re-use as your baby grows.
+1	I have to be honest. I bought these in yellow because they were cheaper than the others.  I am glad I did. They stand out against the hangers and clothes so I can see them.  I am thinking about buying another set because we have a closet organizer and I had to pick which racks I could use them.  Good problem to have.
+1	I wish I had purchased this product before my baby shower! As soon as my daughter was born, I found myself with a closet full of clothes, and no real way to organize them. My husband was constantly looking in the wrong section for an outfit, and it was just chaos! Now, with these simple little markers, I feel completely organized, and I can easily sort out her outfits, so there is no excuse not to be able to grab her an outfit quickly. I will definitely purchase these for any future children I have, and continue to use them for many years to come.
+1	I love this product. Great price and great for keeping the closet organized. It comes with a pack of stickers that continue on in sizes way past the toddler years. LOVE IT.
+1	These are helpful to keep the different clothes sorted by size so you can put clothes of many sizes in the closet without getting them mixed up and making it easier to locate.
-1	I dont know what kind of crazy closet bar we have, I know it is new and was purchased at a hardware store...and these do not fit.  I really like that too =/
+1	Just bought this the other day and got them in and already have them hung in my little girls closet! I am a organizer and these are perfect for organizing your childs closet!
+1	I'm glad I bought these and it would be really helpful if the hubs would actually read the labels so I wouldn't have to reorganize every week...
+1	So cute, organizes the closet so I can easily see where the certain sizes are.  We got a ton of hand me down clothes and have a closet full of clothes ranging from newborn to 2 years old.
+1	Great for organizing clothes for a nursery. Two stickers are provided for each of several sizes. A definite must for a nursery!
+1	I just wished it was wider to fit more loosely on my closet rod. It fits kind of tight on my thick closet rod.We have a custom thick hanging rod, so it doesn't run smoothly.But I'm sure it will fit fine in standard closets.It's a great organizing tool!
+1	With 3 boys close in age who all share one closet, these organizers are a must!  They help me keep the 4 year old from wearing pants 4 inches too long, and the 6 year old from wearing high-waters.  And since getting them, not once has my husband dressed either of our older boys in the toddler's clothes!
+1	Love this. My husband was getting confused in my baby's closet whenever he had to get clothe for her and this helps him differentiate the different size clothe.
+1	I realized very early on that I was receiving so many different sized clothes for my new baby girl that I couldn't keep track of how many pieces of clothing I had in each size. I purchased these dividers thinking I was being silly to go to this extent of organization! But as soon as I received them and put them in the closet I realized how much easier it was to keep track of what I had in each size. I probably never would have noticed otherwise that I was desperately short of newborn sized clothing before it was too late! I had previously just been looking at the total amount in the closet and thinking I was doing good on the clothing supply. Because I received so many larger sized clothes from recent new mom friends and shower gifts I was running out of room for smaller sizes so my next purchase is a closet doubler (see my link).Organize It All 1346W Closet Doubler, ChromeI think these two products will compliment each other very well! Only complaint is that if you use these in a closet with a shelf above the bar they may not fit completely as the tops of the dividers are very high.
+1	I bought these because they were cheap and provided plenty spoons for your money. They hold up well, even in the dishwasher with hot temperatures. I've been using them since we started my son on Solids and love them. I also love the color variety of spoons it comes with!
+1	A great product, well-made and well-priced.  They're titled &#34;take & toss&#34;.  The &#34;take' makes sense as they are inexpensive and loosing one would be merely inconvenient.  But as to &#34;toss&#34; I find washing and keeping a much more reasonable approach.  A nice product.
+1	These are almost too nice to &#34;toss&#34;, unless you really had to. They go nicely thru the dishwasher so haven't tossed any yet. Very easy to hold, colorful, and sturdy.
+1	I bought these for use on a camping trip and ended up reusing most of them despite my intent to use them as disposables. Now I keep a few extras in the car, diaper bag, etc. for when I inevitably forget a regular spoon.They're the perfect size for little mouths and great to swap in when someone wants to just teethe on the spoon instead of eating. (My other spoons have metal handles.)Also, the handles are easier for ME to hold than the flat metal ones - the contours give me a better grip.We're starting to try to get her to feed herself and I'm offering her these and the toddler-sized take-and-toss spoons to use. So far? Messy but fun. ;)
+1	I got these spoons for a trip and planned to throw them away but like them so much I had to keep some of them, and plan to buy more if we ever run out. They are thicker and more durable than I expected and fit great in the diaper bag, yet the handles aren't too short to use them as an everyday spoon. They go through the dishwasher fine. I am super impressed with these.
+1	We love these spoons! The quality is surprisingly great for the price. I love that I don't have to worry about pitching them, if we are out somewhere and it's easiest to do so. However, we do try and wash them for re-use sometimes if possible, and they have held up great!
+1	Initially, we had purchased the Munchkin 6-pack Soft Tipped Infant Spoons and loved them. Once my kiddo got up to three meals a day, we were going through the spoons so fast we were constantly running out. For the same price as the Munchkin spoons, we got 16 of these! They aren't as pretty or quite as sturdy, but they are great. These are smaller so they fit better in his little hand. The colors are wonderful. And with the amount that you get, if you lose one or two, it's no great loss. If we'd started with these, we'd have been fully stocked from the start!
+1	16 pieces seems excessive until one drops on the floor, one is thrown, he'll want to hold one and feed himself, etc. It is amazing how many spoons you can go through in one day.
+1	These spoons are the perfect size for first feeders.  The bowl of the spoon is narrow and not too deep, so the food actually gets into my son's mouth.  These are really light too, unlike the spoons that have metal conponents.  Don't go with the more expensive spoons.  These work the best, are cheap and are BPA free and recyclable!
+1	We purchased to have this as a &#34;to go&#34; spoon, and it ended up being a favorite spoon.  Best for ages 6mo-10mo, after that they bite too much and want more substantial spoon.
+1	I love these. You get a lot of spoons for a low price, and they are durable yet don't hurt my baby's teeth when he wants to chew on one, and he also can't chew threw them because they are thick and sturdy. Perfect size for little bites, and in my opinion perfect for any age of baby. I love these so much more than those metal spoons with the rubberized ends that occasionally hurt my baby's mouth when he bites in too far or the edge catches his gums. These spoons are keepers, and I will order more if I end up losing too many :)
+1	These spoons are perfect for babies just starting solids. They are light weight, easy to hold small amounts of pur&eacute;ed food and I love that they are dishwasher safe. The package claims top rack safe, but I have been able to wash them with the rest of the silverware on the bottom.
+1	these hold up in dishwasher and if upside down you can spin it works as fun game when trying to get in last bite, I always have extra spoons on hand
+1	You can't beat the price.  I purchased these to take with me on day/ weekend trips.  They were cheap enough so that I wouldn't be upset if I ever lost one.They are much sturdier than I expected for something considered &#34;toss-able.&#34;  I have washed these in my dishwasher twice already and they are holding up great.  There are no unsightly scratches or discoloring.My pack arrived with blue, green, purple, yellow, orange and PINK spoons.  I have a daughter, so, it was a pleasant surprise.The size is perfect for my 9 month old daughter's little mouth.  I have a 3 year old and although it is on the small size for him, it is still large enough for him to get enough food on the spoon and into his mouth.  I would not recommend these spoons for children over the age of 2.The product arrived at my door in 5 days.
+1	We have 2 of these mirrors, one in my sedan and one in my husbands SUV.  It is great in my car, and we have had no problems.  It is a nice big mirror and I can see my daughter very well, without it blocking my rear window.  The SUV is a different story.  Since the car seat is in the middle, there is no head rest to attach it to, and so we have is all rigged up with bungie cords to keep is secure.  Even so, it is still better than the other mirror we tried initially.
+1	Our car does not have a middle headrest and we have leather seats, so if I had read these reviews first, I might not have registered for this mirror. I'm certainly glad that I have it now! My husband rigged it up on one of the side seat headrests without too much trouble and it works just fine. It is at a bit of an angle, but who cares as long as I can see my son? If your car is like mine, be prepared for some fiddling, but it will work. It's on there very securely and hasn't moved in the three months we've had it.I love being able to glimpse at my son when we are driving around, just to see how/what he is doing. A friend of mine doesn't have the mirror and she turns around at every stop to check on her son (we can't help it - we're first time moms).By the way, we were concerned about it becoming a projectile in a crash, but, when we had the carseat installation checked by our insurance company, they said it was secure enough and not to worry. Especially if it kept me from turning around in my seat every few minutes!
-1	This is a good enough idea, but it doesn't work.  I just got this a few days ago and it does not stay on.  It falls off about 3 times a day.  If I use the oven it falls off within minutes.
+1	I have been using this guard for about 3 weeks now, and it does exactly what it is suppose to do. My son is tall, and was reaching up for pans, and is now unable to get to them. I am very pleased with this product.
-1	It worked well for a few weeks then the adhesive wore off and quit sticking.  Now it is just a crappy piece of plastic.
+1	This guard has been fantastic.  Our stove has cast iron grates that get really hot when we cook.  After my child started walking I was really nervous they were going to reach up and touch the grate - not now!  These apply really easy with double sided tape that is included and have withstood the heat.  Come off really easy out of their brackets to clean.  Would recommend if you want a little extra security around the stove!
+1	Be sure to use the sealing discs between this and the bottle or milk will get everywhere!
+1	The kit came with two sets of adapters to connect directly from the Medela pump to most bottles, the one pair fits Avent (old & new style Natural) bottles perfectly. So much more convenient to pump directly into normal 4/9oz bottles!
+1	One thing to point out in particular, you get two sets. There is no need to purchase two if you double pump. I made that mistake. I have used these many times and I have not any leaking problems. Although, I did listen to other reviews and I do use the blue sealing disk when using the avent bottles that require them. The plastic is heavy duty and prevent from having to purchase the bottles that go with your machine specifically which can be expensive. They have saved me a lot if time too. Previously, I would pump into medela bottles, then pour into avent to feed. Now I have one less bottle to wash every time I pump. Huge Timesaver. I would definitely buy again.
+1	I use these with my Medela pump. We love Avent bottles. I didn't want to buy Medela nipples and rings. Now I pump right into bottle and don't use bags. So much easier!
+1	I was so hoping this would work with the drop ins bottles so I could pump right into the drop ins, but no.  It was a waste of money for me but I'm sure a dandy product.
+1	I bought these so that I can attach my Avent bottles directly to my Medela breast pump.  It connects perfectly and makes it easy for me to pump direct into the bottle rather than having to transfer the milk from container to container and risk contaminating it.  I also like that it came with adaptors for the Avent Via breastmilk storage containers as I use those as well.
+1	I hated switching from a standard bottle to the avent bottle and now I can just pop an avent bottle on my original pump. I am going to clear out all of my "normal" bottles and only have the avent bottles in the house. This is going to clear up so much space.
+1	I didn't use these for long, as I switched from Avent to Tommee Tippee due to baby having problems with fussiness due to gas. The products work as described with no leaking and attach easily to my Medela pump. Love that you can buy the Avent in a two pack for your double pump. I had to buy the Tommee Tippee converters individually.
+1	This conversion kit allows me to pump into the large 9 oz Avent bottles, which is very helpful as the Medela bottles only allow up to 6 oz.
+1	Bought these because we were using a Medela pump and Philips bottles. Of course the breast pump and bottle industry can't make it easy for everything to work together. These adapters fit great onto the pump and the Philips bottles. Don't feel forced to buy all new bottles or a brand new pump just to make your system work!
+1	These worked with the Medela Breast Pump. Two different sizes comes in the box. One size did work with the Natural Flow bottles.
+1	if you use avent bottles, this is soooo convenient :) I highly recommend this product, I can pump directly to my PES bottles.
+1	I use it with a set of Avent storage bottles (many nipple fit on them) and my rented Medela Symphony pump.  There are 2 plastic convertors in the kit but I only use 2.  No leaks, easy to clean, works just like the description claimed.
-1	I am currently using the adapters to connect my Medela Symphony Kit to my Avent bottles.Cons:1. The adapters leak where it screws into the bottle.  It is very annoying to pump and still leak milk all over your clothes.Pros:1.  It can be used with Medela kits.
+1	These fit both my Medela & Spectra Dew pumps.  My Medela is ancient - at least a decade old but the newer pump parts still fit it, so these go from the standard bottle size to fit the Avent bottles.I have both the super wide nipple Avent bottles as well as the classic size and these adapters fit fine.I also have the Avent Via storage system and the wider converter fits those just fine as well.I don't know what the other reviews mean about leaking.... I put the bottle caps on that come with the bottles & tops that fit the storage containers on as soon as I'm done pumping.  If my milk is nearing the top of the bottle/container while pumping, I switch out bottles.  But while pumping, I've experienced no leakage.
+1	I love the idea of these. And I have used them successfully. But, I've gotten pretty tired of washing all my pump parts by hand nightly, that these have just added a bit more work to the nightly washing routine. Also, I end up pumping more than the 5 ounces that my Avent bottles hold, so I end up having to transfer the milk and pouring into another container anyway, so it kind of defeated the purpose for me. I'd rather just pump into my medela collection bottles and pour the correct amount into my Avent bottles. But they are handy to have and I'm sure I'll use them again. I give five stars because they could save other people a lot of time and washing - just not me.
+1	Worked as expected. Easy to place on the pump and bottles.
+1	I hated the Avent pump, but loved the bottles. I hated the Medela bottles, but loved the pump. This solved my problem!I could used the Medela pump with the Avent bottles now. Perfect world.
+1	This kit is a  MUST HAVE for any mom who is pumping with a Medela PISA and using Avent bottles to feed your baby. It's so much easier to use this attachment. All you have to do is take your Avent bottle, place the blue ring as you normally would, screw this conversion cap onto the bottle, then screw in your Medela attachment on top of the conversion cap and pump right into your Avent bottle. No more pumping into the smaller Medela bottles, then transfering your breastmilk into an Avent bottle. No more washing extra bottles either! Now you can literally pump into it and either feed your child or cap it and store it right in the fridge. As long as you use the blue ring, there will be NO LEAKS. JUST REMEMBER TO USE THE BLUE RING and you'll be good to go! I've been using it for almost 4 months now, I sterilize it regularly and it shows no signs of warping, cracks, or yellowing.Once again, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the purchase of this conversion kit for Medela moms and Avent bottle babies. It's a time saver and well worth every penny. I only found this 4 months into pumping and I really wished I had found it sooner, so don't hesitate and just purchase this already. Tell your other mommy friends about this kit too, because there are a ton of moms who would find this attachment quite useful.
+1	These are great adapters! I use an avent pump and bottle system but since my husband got a free medela pump from his work, I now needed something to adapt to my avent bottles and cups. These work perfectly, I have never had any issues with leaks or spills.
+1	i was looking for something that can let me use my medela pump and pump right into my avent bottles, and found this adaptor to use.  i usually pump and feed right away so this saves me using the medela pump bottles and then pouring into another avent bottle.  the only thing is, you must remember to put the adaptor ring on the avent bottle before you put this adaptor on, if not, it will leak if you don't stay upright.  this package comes with the adaptors for the avent nurser kit too, but i've never use it, and i wish they just sell them separately.
+1	now i can use my medela pump to express milk and easily store in avent bottles.no more transfer here and there.
-1	I bought two of these undermats and wish I had not.  They do not &quot;grip&quot; our cars leather seats and cause the infant car seats to slide a bit.  We had our car seats inspected and the police officers doing the inspection said not to use these liners.  They advised us the us to use shelf liner.  I instead purchased the Prince Lionheart undermat that has the same sort of soft tacky feel as the recommened shelf liner.  It works the same and is more attractive.
+1	We used this product under our Graco infant carrier car seat base and it worked wonderfully.  Not only did the police officer who checked our installation not tell us not to use, he said it was one of the coolest things he'd ever seen.  After he showed me how to really get that base in tight, the seat didn't move it all.  I think we could have lubed the seat with WD40 and it wouldn't have slid around.  At first I thought the coolest thing about it was the mesh container that hangs in front of the seat - a great place to stash used bottles, diapers, etc., but when we recently took the base out to install the next size car seat, we saw a bunch of caked on spit-up and other nastiness that never made it onto the leather, thanks to the under mat!  Those having problems may just need to put a little more oomph behind their car seat installation.
-1	I bought two of these and thank goodness BRU let me take them back.  They did not grip our leather seats, and actually made the car seat slide around so I took them back, and 3 1/2 years and two more kids later haven't felt like I missed them a bit.  These are unecessary and really a pain.
+1	EXCELLENT product - - VERY VERY useful while traveling (there are electric plug points in all restaurants, hotel rooms and at airport gates etc).very useful at home too.
+1	My husband and I use this product daily.  I had to pump for most of the time I nursed and we had to warm bottles for each feeding.  The water measurer isn't the greatest, it's hard to fill without going over the MAX line or spilling out.  So I just measured about how many tablespoons of water we needed and kept a glass of water next to the machine.  Just scoop out what you need, turn on the machine, and get your baby to stop screaming for food that much quicker.  We've had the product for 7 months and it's still working great.  I would recommend cleaning it out every so often to get rid of hard water build up and such, but it's great!
-1	Like other reviewers, I have had nothing but problems with this thing! The instructions for how much water to add are not right at all. You have to figure out on your own how much water to use, and then, you can do the exact same thing twice and one time will still be ice cold and the other time burning hot. There is a little ring piece, which is not attached, and if you lose it, the thing does not work AT ALL since all the steam just escapes! Ours stopped heating consistently after two months of use. It gets a brown build-up in the bottom, and you can not fit your hand in there to clean it out. The instructions say to wipe with vinegar periodically, which I have found you actually have to do every day or else you will never get the build up out. We are switching to Munchkin brand bottle warmer now that this one has quit working.
+1	This warmer has lasted us through hundreds of bottles and jars of food - I had no idea it would be so useful when I bought it!It's small, easy to use, and heats bottles and food exactly the way my son likes them, because I can add whatever amount of water I need.  This is much more water-conserving than heating water in the microwave and then putting the bottle in it - the warmer only uses a few teaspoons.  And it heats FAST!This makes a very economical and thoughtful baby gift - I have already purchased two for friends.
+1	We heat up both breast milk and formula in this thing. We heat it up in plastic bottles, and in glass bottles. It works like a charm. You have to be quite careful to measure out the right amount of water, as it makes all the difference to the temperature.
+1	We had the last model with our first child and got this one for the cost and ease of use. One thing to know is that it almost always takes the &#34;max&#34; amount to heat up a bottle adequately, but note our son likes his bottle on the warmer side. For the money it's great.
+1	I have tried a few bottle warmers and this definitely the best.  Especially once you consider the price.  It gets the bottle warmer faster than more other warmers.  I have yet to over-heat a bottle (you should always check anyway).
+1	This bottle warmer is easy to use and works quickly. We've been using it for a month and haven't had a single issue with it.
+1	I was definitely skeptical after reading the mixed reviews for this product but I decided to try it anyway.  It is hard to get the amount of water just right but I really like it anyway.  Remember, different bottles will necessitate different amounts of water.  It heats quickly, is small enough to be portable, and is inexpensive.  I highly recommend it.
-1	We were disappointed with this bottle warmer for our twin boys. We found that it can only heat up one bottle every 10 minutes, which is a real problem when you are trying to heat up two bottles or you mess up the first time, and its too cold or too hot, which is common with this warmer because you are constantly adjusting how much water to put in. At 3AM, this is just too much trouble. Also, it lacks a countdown timer, a memory for how long you needed the warmer the last time, and doesn't have a water reservoir. The Dr. Browns is much better, and we have found that one works great for Dr. Browns, First Years and Playtex bottles.
+1	i started to use this one 2 months ago since the baby is borned, and it work perfectly fine. you need to try the tem before give it to baby anyway.
+1	I read a lot of reviews about other bottle warmers.  Some claimed that water would get trapped and were hard to clean.  This one is pretty easy and straight forward.  It does an excellent job at warming our bottles.  It will simply warm up any water that's in the compartment.  With that said, if you pour too much or too little water in, that will alter the results.  The only downside for me is that it won't let you warm glass baby bottles.  I think it's a great product for the price and simplicity.
+1	This product works well when you abide by the instructions and put in the suggested amount of water; not a drop more. It's important to keep the bottom of the reservoir clean, otherwise minerals in the water start collecting and will burn and smell. It looks like rust, but it wipes right out. I was pleased with the performance for the price paid.
+1	My daughter would want her bottles on demand.  Heating her bottles up the long way was not working.  I purchased this in hopes that this will save me time and it did.  I would keep the water vial filled with water so when a bottle needed to be heated I can just pour the water and heat.  Was a life saver!
+1	This works great!  The measurements for heating are accurate.  I only wish it had a buzzer or beeping noise of some sort once it was done warming the bottle.
+1	This is a fast and convenient way to heat bottles.  I have twins and can't wait the recommended 10minutes between bottles for it to cool down so I don't.  I don't have any problems with it.  I use first years gum drop bottles
+1	After reading everyone else's reviews, I was nervous to try this product.  Once I received it (I got 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs), I read the very short and easy directions, and voila!  Perfect warmth on first use.  Whoever who states its too hot or too cold and complains about it clearly has not read the directions and did not try again because it tells you what to do if its not the temp you want.  To use this simple tool, you need to know if you have an old school bottle or the newer wide mouth bottle and how many ounces your bottle can hold (not how many ounces you're using) and whether you're starting from refrigerated or room temp.  These factors will tell you how much water to pour in the heater using a measuring vial that it comes with.  Press the button down (not in, I thought my warmers were broken) and you'll hear a click or see the light go off when it's done (in about a minute or so...amount of time for a diaper change).  If you leave it in there after its done it will keep heating and get too hot, just like when you're cooking on the stove and turn off the burner and your food keeps cooking.  Keep a rag/towel handy to wipe off the moisture around the bottle when its done.The reason why I give it only 4 stars is because the measuring vial is a pain in the a$$ to fill each time and you have to be exact with the amount of filling water to make your bottle the right temp, but the filling lines are so close together.  I'm planning on using a syringe so that I can have a fail safe, thoughtless, easy way to get the right amount of water in the heater.  Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
-1	I got this warmer as a shower gift. It does warm the bottle to the perfect temperature. It has drawbacks, though. I took us 6 minutes to heat up a bottle that we had in the fridge. It also developed some brown crusty looking stuff in the bottom of it, and all the numbers rubbed off the measuring tube. We barely even use it anymore because it it not too convenient when you have a hungry baby waiting for her bottle.
+1	I have not had the problems that others have listed.  My warmer does shut off after a few minutes of warming and has never boiled the bottles.  I have found that it does not warm chilled bottles using the amount of water recommended.  I usually have to warm it twice or use more water than recommended.  Luckily, my baby is not to picky.  It seems to do the job plus is reasonably priced.
-1	I bought this in hopes that I could avoid standing over a pot of boiling water in the middle of the night to heat my newborn's bottle.  She is impatient when it comes to waiting so I thought this little unit would do the trick.  NO SUCH LUCK.  The product review says it's stylish but who cares?  What we really need is functionality and usability and this warmer is neither.  It claims to heat up the bottle in 4 minutes but the milk is unevenly heated, the top of the bottle is cold and the base is scalding.  The milk then needs to be shaken to even out the temperature...a real time sucker when you're in a hurry to feed a wailing baby.  I tried to vary the amount of water I poured into the heating base but this didn't help.  I'm lucky I didn't throw away my trusty little pot since I'm back to warming up the old fashioned way on the stove.
+1	It gets the bottle warm quickly...what else do I want in a bottle warmer? Do I need it to be perfect? No...and it's not. I don't even use the water measurement as it doesn't warm correctly. Maybe we keep our refrigerator really cold but the first time we warmed according to the water measurement it barely warmed it. I know just dump the max water amount in (sometimes more.....)and test it throughout the warming cycle. A full bottle I don't even need to test. I can leave it, change her and come back to a warm bottle.The only thing I hate it the brown caramel-like residue in the bottom. I think maybe the breast milk is leaking out as it warms and is caramelizing in the warmer. It's easy to clean though.
+1	My only complaint I have I about this bottle warmer is that it takes 2 cycles most times to get the bottle to the proper temperature. I am not sure if my fridge is just set to a colder setting than most or what, but I was warming pumped breastmilk and I have had to do it 2 cycles almost every single time because otherwise it's still too cold and my infant son does not want to drink it. The problem with this is that if he is upset and crying and I am not home to nurse him, my husband has to try to calm a fussy baby while attempting to warm up a bottle for him. As per instructions, I *have tried filling it up to 10 instead of 7 and it really didnt help any.
+1	We had this warmer for our second baby and wish I had purchased it for our first born also. This warmer is easy to use and warms up the bottles pretty quickly for that crying baby who can't wait for that milk. It does take a few tries to get used to how much water to use in the warmer for the perfect temp. We had some overheat and underheat until we figured it out. It is very compact which makes it great for travel. We bought it everywhere with us; friends, famliy, vacation etc.Ok now what I don't like is that I used vinegar to clean it out often, but it still has build up on the bottom. Maybe it is just the kind of water we have here. Good recommendation...put it on your registry!!
+1	This heats bottles fast and has auto turnoff when it is down, but I still watch it to make sure doesnt over heat. would recommend
+1	Great product.  Follow the easy directions and you have the right temp. food,formula,etc.  Got this as a gift and use it frequently.  Love the jar lift also.  Would recommend this item.
+1	I'm not familar with other brands but this works well enough for me. I use filtered water since it will gunk up quickly inside using tap water. I also have to keep a close eye on the bottle because it will go from slightly warm to hot very quickly.
-1	This warmer works when it wants to which means only when i'm testing it and never when I need to warm a bottle at 3 am! I'll plug it in and nothing happens. I already threw away the box, so i'm hoping Amazon will still let me return it! I'll be trying a different brand all together.
+1	This really is a great product.  It heats up 4 oz of refrigerated breast milk within a couple of minutes.  It's small enough to stick in a diaper bag if you're going out, too, and since the water vial has a cap, you can pre-fill it.  The only trouble was that the recommended amount of water did not heat the milk beyond a cool temperature -- not even to room temp.  After experimenting, I learned that I had to fill it about a half inch ABOVE the highest number marking (10) in order for the milk to be about as warm as it is from the breast.  And I checked my fridge -- it's the normal temp, about 37 degrees, so it's not because the bottles were colder than normal.  So, I guess I'm a little concerned about what'll happen when we need to give 8 oz instead of 4!*UPDATE* I now use this with the 8-oz size Dr. Brown's bottles (heating with inner parts removed), with 6 oz of milk, and they seem to heat up with less water.  They are also a harder plastic than the bottles we used to use (Medela bottles), so I think perhaps the harder plastic conducts heat better.  Keep this in mind when experimenting with water amounts.  Just a theory.
+1	One thing to keep in mind when purchasing this warmer: it's a great price and gets the job done, but that's not to say that there aren't better ones out there on the market. You do have to keep pulling the bottle out and periodically checking the temperature as it's warming and there are going to be times when it gets way too hot... But once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature AND it's definately a bargain! Also, no need to worry about forgetting to turn it off in those first few foggy weeks of motherhood... auto- shut off!!! This would be a great shower gift!
+1	This is an pretty good bottle warmer. However, it has a timer and auto-shuts, but there is no alarm to tell you that the milk is ready so it's very easy to burn bottle. I used this with many different types of bottles (e.g., Advent, Playtex, Dr. Brown. etc..) and it works for all of them.I would prefer the Dr Brown warmer below which has certainly more featureshttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035LLG2W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0035LLG2W&linkCode;=as2&tag;=justckem-20
+1	unit works fine , warms the bottles as advertized - as for sticking to the timeline and checking the warmth of the milk -- I always double check - glass bottles warm up quicker then the plastic once
-1	The last thing you need is to have to put everything down to check a bottle constantly.  Every time myself or my wife tried to warm a bottle in this thing, it either came out too hot or too cold.  Having to constantly check the bottle became too much of a hassle and we simply quit using this warmer.  Despite following the instructions to a tee, the bottles NEVER came out perfect.  We either had to re-heat the bottle or let it cool down before giving it too the baby.To make things short, I'll say this:  Use the stove or microwave.  Once you get your child into a reasonably predictable routine, you can warm bottles at a reasonable time and easily without having to waste time and money on the First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer.
+1	Bought this as a second warmer to keep at grandmas house to make life easier... Was hesitant because of how cheap it was but was so glad I got it!! Would be a pain to fill the little tube with water everytime if it were the primary warmer at home but as a secondary it's wonderful. Is great for all bottles and use for food and have steamed passies in it when they fall and I don't have a back up with me!
+1	This bottle warmer has been a big timesaver.  I can put a bottle in, change my baby's diaper, and come back to a warm bottle.  This less crying my hungry baby does, the better.  The only thing about this warmer is the trial and error needed to get going.  At first, you have to figure out what amount of water will get your bottle to a good temperature.  Once that is figured out, the warmer is so easy to use.  I also find that cleaning it out every few weeks and letting vinegar sit in it for a little while, will keep it consistant.  As it gets dirty, it tends to become inconsistant.I definately give this Bottle Warmer 2 thumbs up.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the trial and error needed to figure out how much water for the bottle and amount of formula.(I use Avent bottles and they fit great)
+1	I have waited 9 months to write this review based on my purpose of warming up breastmilk. First thing first, this bottle warmer is available at Walmart for $15. I saw the price on Amazon going from $15-$35. So just beware and don't get rips off.We have been using this warmer to warm up frozen breastmilk for 9 months and had no issue at all. Other than the deposits in the heat plate even though we been using distilled water the entire time.We know this warmer wasn't designed for frozen breastmilk but formila in room tempreture. However, other warmer works better for breastmilk are just too expensive. Also due to the bottle storage we use (no bags), we wanted to give this bottle a try. In order to get it to work, we have to experiment and find out the best amount of water measurement to pour into the steamer.The milk bottle we use are the medela plastic one (ok with high heat), we stay away from glass bottle because they get over heated easy and very hard to control the tempreture. Now every bottle of breastmilk we have has different volume of milk but in avg we have about 120ml to 150ml, I take out the bottle from the freezer, turn the cap half open (enough for it to breath but not losen). Then I fill up the measuring tube full (i don't even need those number line these days, they are useless for my purpose), I pour all water in there, set the bottle in the steamer, and I cover it with a coffee mug that fit perfectly (not tight), turn the switch and after 3-4 mins, it will auto turn off, usually there'll be a small cube of frozen milk floating in the bottle, that's why I leave it alone covered for another 2 mins before I take it out and feed the baby. If I'm heating up 150ml- 200ml, I just steam it again with 1/5 to 1/4 water filled in the tube. Everything comes out perfect.This thing is awesome and save us a lot of money. Highly recommanded!
+1	i dont like that if you stop it mid cycle when you come back to warm another bottle it starts halfway through the cycle. it does not re-set. it warms by steam. there is a hotplate at the bottom then you pour water into the chamber and the steam that is created warms the bottle. it comes with the container that you fill up with the water to pour in.
+1	I bought this when my daughter got back from the hospital from the NICU. I realized I didn't have a bottle warmer yet and I needed something fast and efficient because having to babysit a bottle on the stove with a screaming baby was getting OLD. You just put the amount of water you need for your bottle, the less ounces in the bottle the less water the less water you'll need, and the more ounces in the bottle the more water you'll need. I find that with my baby the perfect temperature for 4 oz. is at the "7" mark. You just have to plug it in, put the water into the bottle warmer and press the button. It takes 2 minutes from the time you press the button until the light shuts off then leave it there for about 30 seconds and your baby's bottle is ready. I still test the bottle on my wrist every time and it's remained consistent from the get go. Get a great bottle warmer without breaking the bank. It's convenient to travel with and small and compact to leave on the counter all the time. I would recommend getting this as a baby gift or putting it on a registry. Why pay $80+ on a bottle warmer when this gets the job done for a very reasonable price? Great for new mom's on a budget!
-1	This warmer worked well for a few months.  The switch stopped working and the warmer would turn on as soon as it was plugged in.  Now the heating function never turns off, so I have to watch the bottle carefully before it overheats the formula.  I still use it, I just don't walk away from it because I know it won't turn off on its own as it should.
+1	Yes, sometimes it overheats the bottle if you don't take it out as soon as it's done, but it gets the job done quickly and easily.  And at this price, I was able to buy a warmer for both grandparents' houses.
-1	I have twins and it takes longer to warm in this than the sink and you have to wait ten minutes between each bottle.
+1	I am one of those moms who has a "lazy nurser". Wanting to exclusively breastfeed for at least the first year, I was devastated that my sweet little girl would not latch on properly and that when she did, she was unable to empty me completely. Therefore, we are stuck with frequent breastfeedings followed by supplemental bottle feedings.My husband and I had purchased this bottle warmer planning to use it after I returned to work to heat up breastmilk bottles. I have to tell you, this warmer is terrific! It works equally well with breastmilk and formula. It is quick, and as long as you follow the directions, it heats to utter perfection. We have never had an overheated bottle, and my daughter loves the temperature. She sucks it right down! We have tried both Gerber and Avent bottles, and they both work well in this warmer.Also, the size is really convenient. It doesn't take up much space in the kitchen (not to be totally vain, but it WOULD be nice if it came in black or ecru for better matching capabilities).I liked it so much that I sent one to my husband's expectant cousin. I strongly recommend this product.
+1	Works well and as expected
+1	This bottle warmer works and it works fast!  Only thing people don't realize, is that it takes trial and error.  Bottle sizes are different as well as milk temperature.  It will take longer to heat a bottle from the fridge, rather than one made with room temperature water.  I suggest you use this the first few times BEFORE your baby becomes hungry so you can get to know how it works without getting flustered by a crying baby.  For me, I fill the line to "6" and that heats my 4oz of milk perfectly.  Leave the bottle on for longer after the light goes off and the milk will continue to heat.  So very important you take the bottle off as soon as the light goes off, give it a swirl, test on your wrist (or take a swig like I do) and you'll be good to go!  I've used this with formula and breast milk w/o any issues.
-1	This is the worst bottle warmer ever.  The bottles were either too hot and I mean smoking hot or not warm enough.  Using this thing was the same as just heating a bottle up in a pot!  You could never leave the bottle, walk away and come back hoping that it would be the right temperature.  I would have to put her bottles in, stand there and check every minute or so.  The water tube that comes along with it does not hold enough water to warm her bottle sufficiently.  We had to pour at least three tubes worth of water in there to get her 5 ounce bottle warm.  I ordered the Dr. Browns bottle warmer and am in love!  This mess is going back immediately.
+1	The product was good and served its prupose.. At times there would be a leak from the bottle, I guess this was because we left it a little longer in there.. Easy to clean and used it well the initial 4 months of my newborn.
+1	In the middle of the night when the baby is screaming and you need milk - FAST.  Carefull to check the milk, sometimes can be too hot too fast!
-1	The water vial that is attached to this unit just sits ever so gently on the side meaning IT FALLS OFF CONSTANTLY.  It was so annoying I returned it.  I'm a mom on the go so I would throw this in my bag and take it with me but it was always a chore to have to find the missing water vial.  I much prefer the Munchkin High Speed bottle and food warmer, the water vial stays firmly in place.  But with any bottle sterilizer you have to make sure you don't lose the ring that goes around the top, too bad those don't snap in.
+1	I PURCHASED THIS WARMER AND THE FIRST YEARS NIGHT AND DAY BOTTLE WARMER FOR MY BEDROOM. SO FAR THEY WORK REALLY GREAT AT HEATING THE BOTTLES TO THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THE NUMBERS RUBBED OFF THE WATER VILES AND WE HAD TO PUT THEM ON WITH A PERMANENT MARKER.
+1	Just perfect !!! works great, small, easy to use very practical! For the price it's great! Work with my glass and plastic bottles...
-1	This product is poorly constructed, requires patience and you don't have that with a baby crying. It doesn't heat to a temperature the baby would like, so you end up having to cool the bottle afterwards. Also I have to manipulate the On switch for far too long but I actually get it to turn on. After awhile I just gave up and stopped using it.
-1	I bought this to take out the guess work and hassle of warming bottles, but it is not working for me. I try to set it so that I can turn it on, go change the baby then it would be ready. This method works occasionally but I get inconsistent results. Whenever the light turns off, the milk is still cold and I have to let it sit for another few minutes to finish warming. If I wait too long it's too hot, so I have to stand there and wait for it. Occasionally when I warm a bottle it somehow seems to boil the milk out if it. Don't know if the top of the bottle was loose or what but I'm finding it easier to just go back to sitting bottles in hot water from the tap. Very disappointed.
+1	This is a very simple product to use and works well with almost every bottle on the market.  I use it with born free bottles which are pretty wide and my sister uses it with Avent brand bottles.  This warmer works perfectly well with both brands.  It works really quickly and heats up four ounces of formula, straight from my mini fridge, for my three month old in under 3 minutes.  Not bad when you have a hungry baby screaming in the middle of the night.  Just be sure to read the instructions and follow it thoroughly before use and you shouldn't have any problems as I have not had.  I have also purchased this and given it away as presents to friends.  Every one I have given it to; have loved it as much as I have.  Warm formula always hits baby's spot and helps with gas and spit up problems. I have found it worked well for my refrigerated breast milk and my transition to formula so I can recommend it to both breastfeeding moms and moms who choose to feed with formula (both powdered and premixed canned).  Can't' beat the convenience and it is priced really well compared to other brands of similar items.
+1	I have two bottle warmers, this one and the Avents one. This one is way better and uses steam to warm the bottle instead of boiling water around your bottle/food. The measuring tube tells you how much water to put into the warmer for the amount of liquid you want to warm. It works quickly and is wonderful, especially for the night feedings. Always make sure you test the milk before you feed your baby! I've used this for baby food jars and it works perfectly too. It does have mineral build up over time so you must clean it with vinegar every so often.If you're looking for some advice on other baby registry essentials, check out AllMomsArePerfect dot com.

+1	We love this little warmer. Works well and takes up a tiny bit if counter space. Takes a few tries to get the hang of though: sometimes a little too cold and sometimes a little too hot. Major bummer: if you find that the bottle is too cold, you have to wait a while to be able to use this thing again. I don't know if it's a safety measure or what, but you can't press the button again right away. When you have a hungry baby, that kind of stinks.
+1	My daughter has twins.  She was warming their bottles using tap water.  It was taking too long to get hot and she felt like she was wasting a lot of water (we are in a drought).  I looked at all the warmers and their reviews and decided to get this one.  There is one that warms 2 bottles, but I wasn't impressed with the reviews.  My daughter said this one is pretty fast.  Her only complaint was the directions say to let it cool off for 10 minutes before using it again.  Baby #2 doesn't always want to wait another 10 minutes.  My solution was to send her a second one, even though I know her hubby will complain about having more stuff.  At least they aren't a huge investment.
+1	We totally love this product.  We have two - one upstairs and one in the kitchen.  It's true that it takes some trial and error to see how much to adjust the amount of water that you put into this.  But once you figure it out, it's a lifesaver!  I can't imagine having to wait for plain hot water to heat up a bottle.  We have used it both with the Medela bottles and with Dr. Brown's bottles.
+1	I wish we would have bought this to begin with.  We held off thinking that using hot water in a cup was just as easy.  It is faster than hot water.  Instructions are not exact you have to play with it a little bit to get your water amount correct for your bottle type and amount of milk.
-1	This bottle warmer broke after the first week.  It takes FOREVER to warm the bottles and then it doesn't even warm them.  I'm trying to get a refund right now.  Also, the opening is too small for the newer bottles (TippeTommy, comotomo, etc).
+1	We love this bottle warmer.  It is small so it doesn't take up huge amounts of counter space.  It heats the bottle in a matter of minutes and is never too hot.
+1	I have been using this warmer since I started using bottles at 3 weeks.  I love this warmer except for the fact that it takes 3-4 minutes to warm the bottle.  Not a good thing when she is screaming to be fed.  I use the Avent bottles.  Usually filled with 4oz.  The instructions are easy to use and it has the measuring spoon attached so you know how much water to fill in the warmer.  The only thing I noticed with this warmer is you have to be exact with the amount of water otherwise the bottle is either to warm (too much water added) or the bottle is cold (not enough water added).  We purchased 2 more of these one for each grandma's.  I am looking foward to seeing how this warmer works with baby food jars.
+1	I loved this product myself but my wife used another method. as the baby got older we stopped using it all together, but we could have kept using it if we wanted to and so I would recommend it.
-1	I bought this for my 2nd baby, thinking it'd be easier than warming a cup of water to warm the bottle.  Nope.  I could never get the amount of water and time right.  I just went back to a cup of water and this thing is sitting in a box.
+1	I got this as a gift and love it. You have to experiment with the water tempature first.- I used regular milk so I wouldn't waste formula. I like the compact size. I move it to the bathroom by the nursery. I put in the bottle (avent) and it's heating while I change her diaper and finished just in time. I used a black marker to mark the fill line so it can be seen easily at those 2AM feedings. The biggest downfall is that you have to wait 10 minutes to reheat again. For the price it is well worth it.
+1	Works great if you follow the directions. My husbands not so good at that so the results weren't always consistent, but is never had a problem :)
-1	This is the only bottle warmer I have ever used so I really have nothing to compare it to.  However, I stopped using it after a couple of weeks and realized my son took the bottle just fine without the need to warm up the bottle.  It was difficult to get the bottle at the right temp - it was either too hot or too cold.  By the time I had it at an acceptable temp, my baby was already screaming for the bottle.  The bottle would sometimes be too hot and would leak at the top.  That left a residue at the bottom of the warmer which would emit a weird odor that might make you think something is burning.  You might have better luck with it but it just didn't work for us.
+1	We use the Playtex bottles with the disposable liners and had a problem finding a warmer that stated it could also do those types of bottles.  This was the only one.  It doesn't do too bad, but sometimes it has its days where it nearly boils the formula and the next day the formula might still be ice-cold after getting "warmed".  We do like the auto-shut-off, because that's what we'd listen for at those 4am feedings (the click).  Besides the occasional heating changes, the only other drawback is that there is no easy way to clean it, particularly if you live in an area that has highly mineralized water, and the marks on the measuring cup come off within the first month of use.  I re-marked it with a Sharpie with the two water levels we use (Playtex bottles with and without the thumb slide) so that friends babysitting our son or helping us out by heating a bottle while over visiting know how much to put in.  More than likely we will have to toss this when our son is done using bottles and will buy another one with our next child.  Definitely nothing fancy and maybe not the absolute best product, but it works great for the price we paid for it.
+1	We purchased this bottle warmer for travel use. We have the full sized Dr. Brown bottle warmer but it's too big to carry along on short trips and vacations.PROS:Inexpensive but not cheap. It's hard to find a functional bottle warmer in this price.Sized perfectly for travel. Great to use in hotels and or if you'll be staying with relatives.It will accommodate wide neck bottles. We had no problem warming Dr. Brown's wide neck 8 oz bottles and Similac's odd shaped bottles.Heats up fast. Average warming time for an 8 oz bottle with 5 oz formula is around 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 minutes depending if it's room temperature or chilled.CONS:Outside of bottles gets really hot to touch. Be careful in lifting your bottles with your bare hands.No built in water reservoir. Water has to be measured and poured with every use.Warmer needs a cool down period of at least 10 minutes with every use. It is not designed to warm multiple bottles.
+1	They're for my grandson, we were fine,  , I recommend it.Works great time I answer came with the product.
-1	I'm confused. Why would one even need this product? What's wrong with just shaking the formula in the bottle? That has always worked for us.
+1	My husband and I LOVE this mixer - we first used the Munchkin one, but didn't like that you had to constantly hold down the button to make it work, with this one you just flip the switch and it stays on.  We use this to make a big batch of formula for the day (daycare mandates we have all bottles pre-made for the day) and it works well.  I like that it helps mix the formula and that there are no clumps left so there is no need to shake the bottles when you're done - so I know the nutrients are distributed evenly/correctly.  This is worth the money!**After 2 months of use, though, the first one we purchased broke - not sure how/why, but the mixer came out of unit when we were using it, so we have since purchased a replacement.  Hopefully this doesn't happen again.*******EDIT: Now the second one has broken as well - it starts making a very high pitched whining sound and then the "mixer" comes out of the "base" while you're using it (while it's turned on) and all we're doing it mixing powder formula and water in a mixing bowl - we are not touching the sides or the bottom of the bowl*****
+1	This is fantastic!  I prefer to mix formula one bottle at a time and this was the only thing that I could use to do that short of shaking the bottle (and thus adding bubbles that upset my baby's tummy).  It's inexpensive but it lasted the entire time I was making bottles of formula - for about a year.  I really wish I had had one of these with my first baby.  Worth more to me than what I paid, for sure!
+1	I was so happy to find this on amazon.com and it was definitely worth it for the price. I often have to make bottles on the go or at other people's houses and this allows me to mix formula within SECONDS with virtually no bubbles! I am still using Medela 5oz bottles and it fits easily inside. Just be careful the first time you use it; it goes so fast that it could splash up on you if you aren't paying attention and you leave it in there for too long.
+1	This mixer is great. I used it with my daughter who is 4 and just bought another one for my son. I dont like shaking bottles cause it makes them foamy and I inevitably get formula on me. Also when your done mixing bottles it is great for chocolate milk and grown up drink mixes.
-1	I tried the Dr. Brown system but was unsatisfied for several reasons. First of all, the bottles flowed too fast causing my son to choke and gag with every couple of swallows. Not surprisingly, this led to terrible gas and spitting up every time we fed.Secondly, I think these bottles are overpriced. Even if they had worked for me, I would have been hard pressed to spend all that extra money. Bottle feeding is not rocket science and no mother should have to pay that much to feed her child successfully.Finally, although the wide-neck bottles may be a little easier to clean, they also come with more parts than standard bottles, so it all evens out anyway. Additionally, I found the big Dr. Brown's bottles (8-9 oz size) to be very cumbersome, especially when storing them in the fridge or in a diaper bag.Every baby is different and you've got to pick the system that works best for the both of you. For our particular situation, Dr. Brown's was not the answer.
+1	My son was born 5 weeks early, and weighed in at a whopping 4 lbs, 6 oz. Because his digestive system was still immature, he was extremely difficult to burp, which caused MAJOR gas issues. After going through 2 bottles of Mylicon in the first 2 weeks after he was born, I decided to give these bottles a try. Wow! I saw a difference after the first feeding. I went to burp my son, expecting to spend my usual 15-20 minutes trying to get him to burp, and imagine my surprise after two minutes this HUGE burp came out of this tiny baby! And an hour later, he was happy as a clam, where in the past, he would have his legs pulled up to his chest, in pain from gas.I don't understand what the problem is that people have with cleaning the bottles. So they come with two extra parts...big deal. I hand-wash my bottles, and sterilize them in the dishwasher about once a week, and after the first few washes, the extra parts were a non-issue. I also can't figure out how people can't seem to get the beige vent or the tube clean. Unless you let your bottles sit for days until the forumla gets caked on, a simple soaking in hot water and dish detergent before using the special brush should be all that is needed to keep the vent and the tube clean. If that doesn't work, then you can always boil the pieces for about a minute to sterilize them, without the pieces becoming distorted. I also shake the vents and tubes out after washing to dislodge any water that might be remaining inside the holes. Also, if necessary, I have seen in the Babies R Us store that they sell a 2-pack of vents, as well as a 2-pack of tubes in case the need for new ones arises.My only complaint is that the bottles do leak if they fall on their side for a period of time, so that can be a little tricky when traveling in the diaper bag. I solved that problem by pre-measuring water and putting it into one of my Medela breast pump bottles (which come with lids). Then, while I'm out, I just add formula to the breast pump bottle and shake, then I pour the formula into the empty Dr. Brown's bottle. Problem solved!I would definitely recommend these bottles to anyone who has a newborn that has serious burping and gas issues!
+1	We made the switch from Playtex to Dr. Brown when our son was having issues with spit up and gas. The first thing I noticed about these bottles is there was less dribbling during feedings. I have not found cleaning to be a problem. You do need to use the white disc in the bottles when traveling to keep the bottles from leaking (even if you keep them upright, they still somehow leak), but one solution I use is to pre-measure the powder in the bottle and ad water when ready (instead of carrying bottles of water and adding the powder). It's lighter in the diaper bag, less mess, easier to mix as you don't have to completely remove the components (just move them aside to pour the water in) and I don't have to fool with popping the white disc out by touching the nipple. I did not give the 4 oz bottles 5 stars as the stem barely reaches the top of the formula when filled to 4 oz. Even though I like the size, we found it better to make a 4 oz bottle in the 8 oz size so we don't have to worry about the blue tip being covered with formula.
+1	I bought a starter pack of these bottles due to the fact my daughter spit up alot of other bottles we tried. We now use these, and she can actually sleep after taking her bottle. I know they take longer to clean, but it is worth it if you have a happier baby!
+1	I actually registered for and received the Avent Bottles.  However, I noticed that my daughter was having trouble with the nipples and a ton of gas.  My mother-in-law suggested the Dr. Brown's bottles.  I bought one to see how it would work.  What a difference.  The gassiness that my daughter was experiencing has decreased alot.  I use both the 4 oz and the 8 oz bottles for her.  I bought extra inserts and nipples too.  I also bought the travel caps.  I love these bottles and am so happy that I purchased them.  I would suggest them to anyone.  By the way, I use the Avent bottle warmer and the 4 oz and 8 oz bottles fit perfectly.  They also fit in the sterilizer (laying down).
+1	When my son was born, we tried sampling bottles from several different manufacturers, including Evenflo, Triflow, Avent, VentAir, etc. Dr Brown's bottles really are the best in preventing gas, bottle leakage, and flow problems. We ended up throwing all other bottles away. I had read other reviews about the small parts being difficult to wash, but I don't really have a problem with that. We don't have a dishwasher and I end up hand washing everything. Each set of bottles comes with a tiny brush for getting into the small spaces for the inner parts to the bottles; and a regular bottle brush works fine with the bottles themselves. I can wash and fill 9 bottles in under 20 minutes (perfect timing when putting my son down for a nap). My only suggestion is to bypass getting 4 oz bottles and go right for the 8 oz bottles. We started off with the 4 oz bottles and now, at 3 months old, our son is already up to 6 oz at a feeding. So, we had to pack away the 4oz bottles and go out and buy a bunch of the larger size.
+1	Dr. Brown's bottles are great!  I recently purchased these bottles because my daughter suffers from reflux and needed rice added to her formula to thicken her feedings.  At that time I was using Avent bottles and they did not have a nipple to accommodate the thickened formula.  So, I purchased Dr. Brown's bottles and used the "y" cut nipples for the thickened formula. They worked great.The only downside to these bottles is that when warmed, the milk sometimes rises into the tube inside  the bottle which causes the milk to leak out into the warmer.  Needless to say, I have had to clean my bottle warmer several times.  Now, I warm them up without a top on it and everything is fine.
+1	I was given a Dr. Brown's bottle as a shower gift and am so glad that I got it!  (It was different than the ones available online - an 8 oz. wide-mouth bottle)When I stopped breastfeeding I started using 4 oz. Avent bottles for several reasons.  First, because I ended up with 8 of them after purchasing other Avent products and second, because the lactation consultant that taught my breastfeeding class recommended them stating they were more like the breast.When I started looking at purchasing larger 8 oz. bottles I remembered that I had received a Dr. Brown's bottle and decided to try it to see if my daughter would take it.  The wide-mouth nipples look very similar to the Avent ones.  My daughter "smacks" a lot when she eats and subsequently takes in a lot of air.  She spit up often and would sometimes spit up what looked like half her bottle when she had trouble burping.  She took the Dr. Brown's bottle instantly and so I decided to buy a few more and switch for a week or two to see if there was any benefit.  I'm so glad that I did!Once I got past the fact that the bottle looked as big as my daughter's head (the 8 oz. wide-mouth bottles are very large!), I realized that she was burping much more easily and hardly spitting up at all.I truly believe the benefits of using this bottle outweigh the extra parts you have to clean.  After doing some research I discovered that one of the main reasons bottle-fed babies get more ear infections is because of the "vacuum effect" traditional bottles have.  As the baby sucks on a traditional bottle they have to gradually suck harder and harder as pressure builds in the bottle. This also creates pressure in their ears which can disturb the fluid balance and cause inner ear problems.  The baby also has to frequently break the latch (and the nipple collapses at a certain point of pressure which causes them to unlatch) so that the pressure can equalize in the bottle.  This causes them to take in more air.  Now, when my daughter is really hungry, she can take practically the whole bottle without ever having to break her latch!I really like the nipples as well.  They are much thinner than the Avent ones and mold better to my baby's mouth.  I suppose this is because the Avent ones have to be thicker and stronger to resist collapsing under pressure?Others have stated that leaking is a problem.  They WILL leak only if:1) you heat them without loosening the top (collar/nipple)2) you travel with them without putting the disk in the top designed to keep them from leakingDon't do these things and you shouldn't have any problems.I definitely recommed you at least try these.  I will definitely be purchasing these as shower gifts for new moms!  I do recommend the wide-mouth bottles, though.
+1	I truly believe in Dr. Brown Bottles!  Our baby girl is five weeks old and these bottles helped with her colic and fussiness during and after eating.  We used the Avent bottles and they were a nightmare!  She would cry during and after eating, because she would get so much gas. We are lucky to have found Dr. Browns Bottles. These bottles are a must for babies with colic.
-1	As you can see in the picture the bottles are (supposed) to be clear and NOT the BPA free ones. I ordered these because I wanted the ones that are not BPA free. I wanted them to be completly clear. When I recieved them I was sad to see that they were the BPA free kind. If I wanted the BPA free ones I would have order them for $7 cheaper per pack..needless to say I am getting a refund. But apparently Dr. Browns doesnt make the clear (non BPA free) ones anymore :( So I suppose I will have to get the BPA free kind, but at least I will be getting them cheaper then this.
+1	My baby has reflux and extra gas just makes him completely miserable.  We got these bottles when he was 3-weeks old and they really do make a difference!  I'm a pediatrician, so I was a skeptic when I read that the bottle claimed to reduce gas/colic.  But I think I'm convinced!  At the very least, it makes it easier for him to eat since there is no negative pressure created from suction... the food just flows!  Thus, the baby swallows less air from the having work so hard to get food.  If your baby has reflux or is very gassy, this bottle is definitely worth a try!
+1	Originally I was thinking of buying the Playtex nurser system, but did't want to spend more money on those little plastic inserts. My baby has bad gas, and I knew these bottles would help. They have proven to be the best there is. There are a few parts to each bottle but it is easy to put together in no time. And I'd rather clean a few parts then spend more money on those plastic inserts. It practically stopped his spit-up, he's never had colic, and by using these bottles and giving him gas drops, he's got no gas, and is a happy baby! I also like how these bottles easily connect to my breast pump---they say it's best to pump into the bottle you're going to feed your baby with, I don't know why. I bought the 4 oz bottles for when he was a newborn, and now we use the 8oz bottles too. I'm trying to spread the word about how great these things are. And they aren't expensive!
-1	I read the reviews and thought this was going to be the answer for the cereal bottles and bought 9 bottles in total. However, everything clogged in them and it never worked well for me at all.Also, Target lost my order and eventually it arrived, weeks late. Then, when I tried to return it for a refund, they had an administrative glitch and refunded us for $0. We just received the correct refund the other day, after multiple phone calls and time. Frustrating...A very bad experience with a product that worked very poorly for me.Not recommended.
+1	My son has reflux and the doctor said to put some rice cereal in his bottle. These nipples have helped me to do so. It took my son a couple of tries to understand not to suck too hard because he was getting more but he's a pro now!
+1	I like this travel holder of utensils for my little one. Since your not able to choose colors, I was hoping for green and blue and I received just that. I like that it came with the variety of forks and spoons (green). The cover easily snaps it close (no fuss),washable, BPA-free, slim and portable. What more can I want from this product? Nuby makes great products so I would buy this item again with my next baby!
+1	We like this and have used it often. However, only seven of the eight utensils will fit with the lid on the case. This didn't matter much for us, though - we just leave a spoon at home! Also, the fork tips are rounded, so our son has a little trouble spearing things with it. He is old enough (fifteen months) to be able to use a pointier fork, so I will be checking soon to see if one of our sharper forks will fit in the case.And, as it says in the title, colors can vary. Ours is orange and yellow, which I like better than the pink in the picture since it's more gender neutral.
+1	They work well. It's always nice to have extra nipples for your bottles. They are easy to clean. I recommend them.
+1	I used these with the Evenflo glass bottles. They work great.Evenflo Classic 4 oz. Glass Nurser - 6-Pack
+1	Nipple flow rate is just right for babies older than 6 months. Easy to wash. Good value. Be sure to separate the nipples! Slow, medium and fast are indistinguishable!!!
+1	Like it a lot. They are great made material. I change this silicone nipples for 4 months. Only works for evenflo bottles. Highly recommend.
+1	These work great with standard bottles. I like that I can order them online with amazon prime so it avoids a trip to the store just for 1 small item.
-1	We used lvl 1 nipples on our evenflo, avent, and Medela bottles with no problems.  These level 2s leaked in all of our bottles.  We aren't using the evenflo bottles anymore since she drinks more than 4oz at a time now.  At any rate, they're leaking and I've thrown them out. :o(
+1	My baby has always used Evenflo nipples.  At 3 months, he was having a hard time getting the milk to flow through the 0-3 month nipples, so we bought some of the 3-6 month and 6+month nipples.  The 6 month nipples flowed too fast even at 5 months, but now that he's 6 months, they work perfectly for him.
+1	These nipples worked perfectly and wore well.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  Never developed any stains either.  It helped that they came in different sizes for varied flow.
-1	I have the nipples given to us in the hospital and they are slow flow. These nipples allow milk to flow out when the bottle is upside down unlike the other slow flows I have.
+1	These are very good. Only problem I would say is that there is no way to tell which are fast, medium or slow - there are no markings. So you have to keep them organized in seperate bags. When you have Dr. instructions on feeding your baby (as I do, she has swallowing issues), you need to have different nipples and these are a drag without having a system of telling which are which. To figure out which it is, you have to put liquid in each one and see how fast it comes out. Easier to just keep them seperate all the time!
+1	These low-flow nipples helped both my grandchildren when they were newborns until about 5 months. They had much less colic and gas when using them. I've always used them with the old-fashioned evenflo glass bottles and, recently, they have become very difficult to find. I've stocked up to have them for future grandchildren, because I haven't come across another type or brand of nipple that works so well.
-1	My son never used these...since he is a boy and the ones I received were pink...so I can't attest to whether he liked them or not.Maybe it's just me, but colors may vary just doesn't fly with baby stuff unless all the colors are neutral.
+1	I gave these 5 stars because they are soft and well designed. However my baby doesn't like them but it is my own fault for not reinforcing the pacifier soon enough so I bought these to try them, hoping that my baby would magically take it. It might work for your baby, go ahead and buy it and they are very affordable.
+1	The paci seems nice.  Shaped more like a bulb and less like the orthodontic ones.  My little one refused to use this paci, but he is very particular when it comes to these.
+1	Let me first say that I didn't buy our pacifiers from Amazon, so I haven't had any problems with colors or anything.This pacifier is my son's favorite. Now that he is old enough that this paci fits in his mouth, he loves the bulbous shape of the nipple. He can hold it in his mouth easily, and it doesn't seem to bother his sore gums, now that he is teething badly. With the more narrow base, he can compress the nipple inside his mouth without putting a lot of pressure on his gums. The large round base makes it easy for him to manipulate on his own, and it doesn't make any goofy imprints on his face.Update:My twins are now 18 months old, and not only does my passi-loving boy still adore this pacifier, now his typically thumb-sucking brother likes to walk around with one of these pacifiers in his mouth, too. We have tried other pacifiers, because these particular ones are becoming difficult for me to find at my local store. My boy didn't like any of them. Only this one will do. We did have to look over all of the "bulb" portions of the pacis, to check for wear, so some of our older ones had to be thrown out. It's not a mark against the product though, since my boys have plenty of teeth, and like to bite and pull on these.
+1	First try I bought her pacifiers, I bought these at the grocery store and ever since she will spit out or throw any other pacifiers, but these. More than half the time she'll go right to sleep when I give her her pacifier or she'll calm down. I don't give a crap about color because its not like my daughter cares right now anyways, as long as these do their job and help my daughter stay calm or go to sleep is ALL I care about.
+1	I received 2 packages as ordered and on time.  One pack was blue and one was pink. The pacis differ slightly from the photo. Not sure if it makes a difference, but the ones I received the rubber part is pulled through and clamped under the paci. These seem to expel water from inside the nipple easier, which is good.  Because I have had some that looked like the one pictured and it is difficult to clear the water after washing.  Then baby makes a squishing noise when sucking and makes it hard for him to sleep. My lactation consultant recommended these originally because the angled tip ones can cause tongue thrusting and we were having issues.  These tend to help baby get his tongue under the bulb. This is the second time I ordered from here and received the same style.  Last time I got two packages of pink.  I have a boy.  But it is okay, as we use these for sleep at home only.  Since these are so hard to find retail (only at Wall***t)and often out of stock, we have been using a similar shaped paci from avent? I think on outings. I wanted to get him used to a different type in case we ran into a situation where we couldn't find this paci.  Overall I am happy with the product and the shipper (preferred mart), I just wish we could pick our color or they sent neutral colors.
+1	I had problems with my baby not taking a pacifier. I tried to give him every single kind & he hated them all until I came across these. He took them right away & after taking these for about 2 months he know takes other pacifiers but these are definitely his favorite.
-1	My baby kept on gagging on these. The teat is very big! Not impressed with these pacifiers at all. Don't buy!
+1	I bought these through prime to avoid a trip to a box store.  I like these.  They are not fast flow, which would choke my son.  These are perfect for younger babies.
+1	I have cats.. and they like to get a hold of the nipples when I leave a bottle out so I need to keep buying these. They work perfect for a few different bottles I use & are in expensive!
+1	I like Gerber products. My son uses Gerber bottles so I have to buy gerber nipples. Fast flow works great  for my 30 months-old son.
+1	great value. i bought them for replacement nipples for the gerber essential bottles and they fit perfectly,, no leaks nice flow.. would recommend them for new borns.. great quality and durability!! perfect
+1	This is an good product, little loose for medela 5oz & 8oz bottles that we have. They almost dont fit the nipple rings of the medela bottles the nipples come out of the ring when my son handles them a little rough and all the milk starts pouring out. We had to use these nipples with Enfamil Nipple Rings/CapsEnfamil Slow Flow Soft Nipple, 12-Countthe only down side is these caps dont take or have any caps.But there is one big advantage of these nipples, which is they dont get stuck like other nipples. My baby is used to pinching on the nipple hard, other nipples get stuck due to vacuum and milk doesn't pass. This one doesn't get stuck because of the tooth inside the nipple. I wish it fit the medela bottle a little better. It is said to be good for colic babies not sure how exactly that works.I would recommend this if your kid has the same problem as mine. The only thing is that you have to be sure that it fits you bottle these are the standard ones. I think one good test is if the free standard nipples that come with those ready to feed Similac bottlesSimilac Advance Newborn, Ready to Feed, 2-Fluid Ounces (Pack of 48) (Packaging May Vary)or above mentioned enfamil nipples fit you bottles then these will fit your bottles as well.
+1	I have tried almost every nipple for my twins. These work very well with my daughter who has acid reflux. She is spiriting up less since I started unsung these nipples. I am going to order more
+1	Bought these for my newborn and I love them! It's easy for him to intake since I bought it in slow flow.  Would buy more!
+1	I had latex nipples for my Gerber bottles, but after a couple washes they felt sticky & didn't ever seem clean.  So I tried these & they are SO much better.  Much more durable & easier to clean.  Since they are clear it is easy to see if you missed a spot of formula, especially if it was a bottle that didn't get rinsed right away.
+1	It really helps to have extra dome caps. I find when I run them through the dishwasher, inevitably at least one flips over and fills with dirty dishwater by the time the cycle is complete. If you have to rewash it, or if you simply misplace one, its great to have extra. Given that we always have lots of bottles in circulation, it pays to have a few extra.One trick to get them from flipping over in the dishwasher and collecting water is to place four of them together face down and pin them down by putting a bowl on the top of them to weigh them down. Do that and they'll always come out clean.
+1	I use this not only for baby's bottle cap but to train baby to sip from a regular cup.  I fill it halfway with water and have my 8 month old sip from it. She enjoys it, especially that its summer and hot, I give her cool water.  She loves taking sips! Be careful and just let baby's lips barely touch the water as it could go into the wrong tube.  I know when she's done when she lets the water spill out from her mouth, sort of playing with the water.
+1	The lids to our bottles seem to forever be disappearing at day care.  It was great to be able to pick up some replacement lids without needing to replace the entire product.
+1	We use these BPA-free caps to cover our toddler's Klean Kanteen sippy. If you are looking for a cover to keep the sippy clean, these are fantastic and fit the Klean Kanteen perfectly. Great solution that allows us to use the steel, safe sippys with the Avent system.
+1	This pinch guard goes on easy (and comes off easy on the rare occasion that we want to close the door to our playroom).  The kids used to play with the door so much we talked about just taking it off.  Someone was always getting their fingers pinched.Since we got this they actually stopped playing with the door all together since it won't close.I would have given it 5 stars if it was just a little thicker  - if it was it would also be able to prevent the hinge from closing on little fingers too.Overall, it does what it says it does, for a good price, without being permanent.
+1	I think these are sturdier than others we've tried and they makes them good for insistant toddlers. Very good product.
+1	I try to keep ahead of what will harm my kids like covers over the oven knobs and a lock proof top for sparkletts water dispenser. These are great too. I can put them high enough that the kids can't get to them and don't have to worry about squished fingers. My husband bought too many and he ended up using one on a remote for the TV so that the kids would stop losing it. Talk about a great way to repurpose this thing. It is sturdy and will stand up over time.
+1	This pinch guard is great. It stays in place and super thick. It's a little pricey, but you get a good product.
+1	We are buying more of these.We bought two originally to keep our door cracked and the baby room door cracked so we aren't opening and shutting doors all the time. It's just enough to let the crying noise through but not the lights from the rest of the house.They have withstood twin teething toddlers, and fit our doors great. We live in a house with doors from the 60s.Most of the bad reviews about these are on exterior doors being slammed or blown by wind... all I can say is they can withstand the slamming of a toddler really well.
-1	I had high hopes for these little guys but no such luck. Easy packaging literally open and they are ready to go. I put one on my bathroom door and it worked to prevent it slamming on my son's fingers, but it left the gap at the other side of the door where the hinges are, where he eventually worked his way over and CRUNCH slammed them in there instead. :(I am sure these were designed for the one option on the door and they work for that, but they did not address the other side and for that I give it a 2 star.I have since removed them and found that my daughter uses them as elf ears for dress up. awesome.
+1	I had found a couple of these at a local discount store that were on sale that I just couldn't pass up. I thought they might be a little too good to be true but for $1.50 each I figured it wasn't a lot to risk. Well, these are great! We have one on our 15-lite dining room door that our 20 month toddler will sometimes close (or slam) and one on her bedroom door. It makes me feel so much better not having to worry about her slamming her fingers in the door. It also helps on her bedroom door from hitting the squeaky spot (when we go in to check on her at night so we don't wake her).Very easy to take on the go to grandparents/hotel!
+1	Either way the ones they are selling here seem to be the standard ones that are pictured not DropIns as the Title says.  Dropins cost more for the amount you are getting.  Standard liners are not hard to use.  You just stretch them around the bottle top, hold on to them, and carefully fill them.  We left the tabs on the bag that they say to remove because my son never noticed them and they seemed to hold the bag on better.  Unfortunately you can't mix the formula in them because its hard to measure correctly where as you can pretty well with the dropins.  Standard liners though stay air free better than the Dropins.  Way better.  Also we didn't buy the Playtex dropins, the store brand was cheaper and just as good.
+1	These worked well and were easy to use but we are tall people. If you cannot reach the top of the closet door easily you may want to try and find a different product.
+1	It's cheap.  It's easy.  My kid's cant reach it.  My only suggestion is to resist the urge to tighten it a lot, because it can be a little hard to loosen afterward.  As long as it's snug, it's not going anywhere.
+1	Bought these to keep my little explorer out of the pantry, linen closet, etc.  These work well on slated bi-fold doors.Pros:Can unlock the mechanism and then open the closet with 1 hand, important with baby in other handInexpensiveBlend in nicely with the white painted doorKeeps toddler from rearranging the closetsCons:The locks aren't as sturdy as a thicker plastic or a metal lock would be (these locks are plastic) and if my toddler really wanted to get into the closet, in another year or so he might be able to pull hard enough to break in.  (But he hasn't busted into the closet yet.)In all, the product does what it says, keeps my toddler out of the pantry.I recommend purchasing these locks.
-1	Don't waste your time with this one--it just pops right off the top.  I haven't found a good solution for the bi-fold door, sorry.
+1	These locks are AWESOME. We slid them into the folding spots on my preschooler's closet doors. The photo is misleading and makes it look like they lock in the middle between the doors, but they actually slide into place where the doors fold, so make sure to order two.
+1	These things are great!  They work well to keep toddlers out of closets and such but they will go flying if you forget it's on there and just open the door with a bit of force.  I purchased these for all the closets in my home and found that with solid oak doors I had to remove the adjuster piece to get it to fit...not an issue but I don't think they work quite as well without that bit of reinforcement.  I also purchased some for the pediatric therapy place to keep littles out of the toy closets and am always told that the other moms love it and want to know where it was purchased!  Overall I believe they work well as a training tool to help teach toddlers places that are off limits but eventually the kids will figure out how to yank the door open and send it flying.
-1	Unless you have 20 minutes to kill while your baby is screaming for a bottle, you don't want this.  I first used this on a venture to BRU for a Grandparent's Day Breakfast and while Grandma was sitting in on a 529 seminar, my daughter suddenly discovered that she was beyond famished - so up we go out to the car to warm up a bottle!  Now, supposedly this warmer can be used with Dr. Brown's bottles but the combination didn't work for us.  First of all, the bottle has to be positioned in the warmer a certain way so that it presses a safety latch to keep the warmer on.  Unless the bottle is a regular generic bottle with a gallon of fluid inside, it won't keep the heating latch engaged.  I had to sit there and continuously push the bottle down onto the latch AND then after 10 minutes, the bottle was still ice cold!  I have no idea how to warm a bottle in the car and have no reccomendations, but I will tell you that this mini blood pressure machine will do nothing to benefit the appetite of an impatient child when she's hungry!
+1	For the most part, I like this product. The first one I bought died after about 15 uses. The second one outlived my son's bottle use, and it worked great. You do have to shake the bottle to distribute the heat evenly and test it, but that's normal for any bottle warmer. Ours worked in about 10 minutes, but it depends on how warm your baby likes their bottle. For $10 I was happy with it.
-1	The idea is great, the product is not so great. We have the same reviews as everyone else. The bottles (we use VentAir) do not touch the "on" sensor, and it takes more than 30 minutes to warm our 8 oz bottles. Our son will not take them luke warm, he likes them very warm.How we made it work for us:Clothes pin that we just clip on over the sensor to turn the warmer on.And one hour before our son's feeding time we start warming the bottle.Very slow process, I wish I would have done more research upon buying this warmer.
+1	Tons of fun for a tiny tot
+1	My son has enjoyed these stacking cups since age 6 months and still at 1 year they are one of his favorites! They are so simple but he loves them!
+1	My son is 20 months old, and we got these cups well over a year ago. They're still one of his favorite toys!When he was little, we'd build towers out of them, and he'd knock them down. When he was a bit older, he'd yell into them or bang the cups together. Now he can nest and stack them on his own. He puts other things inside them, under them, etc. I love to see all the way he can come up to play with such a simple toy! (I'm really big on toys that don't "do stuff" but encourage kids to use their creativity.)We also use them to teach him about colors ("can you bring mommy the green cup?" etc.), about "big" and "little," etc.
+1	We bought a set for the bathtub, and one for the playroom and my little girl really gets a lot of enjoyment out of these.
+1	My 7.5 month old daughter enjoys these cups. She loves mouthing them and banging them together. The cups easily fit into one another. The cups can also be stacked into a tower, but not securely. The cups are numbered on the bottom and have small holes (each cup has a different shape hole...star-shaped, etc). Each cup is a different color and all the cups are easy for my daughter to hold. My package came with a free plastic link, which was great to attach certain toys to the infant car seat. However, the link cannot be attached to any of these stacking cups! Oh well. I still like free things!My daughter enjoys simple toys, such as these. She doesn't like toys that play music, have blinking lights, wiggle, or talk. If your baby seems to enjoy classic style toys or you're not sure, then you should get this toy (or any type of stacking cups/blocks). My husband found a great way to entertain our daughter. He would line up the cups, do some spirit fingers over the cups, quickly place the cups into one another and then give a "ta-da!" She always laughed :)
+1	Cute cups for the kids to play with.  Make great bath toys.  Colors are nice.  I would buy as a gift in future
+1	These cups are a favorite in my house. dishwasher safe and colorful- so we always have a couple on hand to keep my son occupied, even during mealtime since they can be cleaned easily
+1	I was excited to get this.  I love this and so do the children. It washes up nicely on the top rack of my dishwasher. This is played with everyday.
+1	I bought these sturdy cups for my grand-daughter, age one year. This age and beyond love to explore with objects that can be stacked, nested, and rolled. They also have holes and are fun for water play.
+1	My 8 mo old loves these. She mostly just knocks them down and bangs them together, but she does actively play with them. They have tiny holes in the bottom that are die cut in different shapes, so you could use them in the tub, count the holes (they correspond with the stacking order of the cups). They are durable, colorful and they stack well. The set we received had colors that were different from the pictures, but I actually like the colors we received more.
+1	What a simple toy! At first I couldn't visualize how a baby (my first) could find a set of stacking cups interesting and enjoyable. Well, at first all he did was scatter them about. Then he started banging things with them. Then he started holding them in his hands and walking around with them as if he had hooves. Finally, he started to study them and spent a lot of time at this activity.At the present time, our boy is 15 months old. Now he takes the stack apart, arranges the cups on a flat place, goes back to get them and put them back together in the proper order. I sometimes mix them up on his flat place and turn a few upside down. He immediately goes to the pile and sorts them out in the proper orientation and order and rebuilds the stack. Then he smiles at his accomplishment. It's rather amazing.He seems to find the cups endlessly fascinating. When he's whiny or grumpy, I give him the stack and that immediately grabs his attention. We take them everywhere. In the bath. In the car. It's a simple and inexpensive delight.Gary Peterson
+1	My baby loved these the first time I put them out!  Sometimes it takes a few times before she likes something, but these stackers were fun right away!  They are bright and colorful and fun!
+1	my 9 month old son love these cups, the quality is very good and the colors are beautiful, he plays with these everyday.
+1	We bought these when my son was 6 months old. It's a year later, and he still loves them. He is able to figure out a million ways to use these cups and they are always a go-to toy for him. I highly recommend them.
+1	My son's PT recommended we get these for help during tummy time- they held his interest as we moved them
+1	My 5 month old loves these stacking cups.  It's a great toy for him and I know he'll like them even more when he's older and can actually stack them like they're supposed to go.
+1	I actually got this second hand at a garage sale but this product is very duable and my 9 month old daughter loves to play with these, likes to use in the tub also. I did have to take away the smallest cup because she kept putting the whole thing in her mouth...
-1	I was told it would be helpful to buy stacking cups, so I found these.  Like a couple of other reviewers, upon receiving them, I was disappointed.  These cups are very small and the lip area is small.  The cups do not stack well at all.  I had trouble with the larger cups, the smaller cups were ridiculous.  I returned these and will look for cups that stack better.I will admit, if you wanted something for your child to play with, toss around, these are okay and an okay price.  For the purpose of stacking, these just are not that great.  Disappointed.
+1	We bought these for our 5 month old son.  A classic.  They are affordable and not &#34;cheap&#34; quality.  Great buy.
+1	This is a hit.  Baby loves these.  Whenever we have them out around other kids a little older, the bigger kids want them too.  Great for the tub, playing on the floor, high chair, beach... well, we obviously travel with these.  We know they will always offer consistent entertainment for out little one. The colors were different than shown, but still bright & cheery.
+1	These little cups are a good value.  My grand daughter is only old enough to knock them down at this point but she's having fun.
+1	I don't know what it is about these cups, but they are my son's favorites.  He is happy and content to just crawl around on the floor holding the cups.  As he gets older, I think he will be able to start stacking and building with them as well.  A great investment and a happy baby/momma!
+1	My daughters had cups like these when they were young and they were great for playing in the bath tub, wading pool and sandbox.  My 20 month granddaughter loves her set just as much and has gotten a lot of use out of them.
+1	Is it the stacking, the nesting, i dont know but if you have a child around 1 get this. My kid spends lots of time playing with these and she takes them even in the tub sometimes.  I have already given the same ones as presents as i think that every parent should have these :)
+1	My baby loves these cups! (6 months). Right now she just likes to chew on them and throw them on the floor and watch them spin, but I am excited that she can still learn to stack them later. I like that each cup has little shaped holes (stars, hearts, triangles, etc.) according to the number it says on the bottom of the cup. Great price especially compared to other brands!
+1	My granddaughter plays with these often.  A must have for any child's toy box.This would make a great baby shower gift.  Not too expensive.
+1	Our baby girl LOVED these cups. She still plays with them in the bath now at 16 months, as some of them have holes and can drain the water through. These are a great way to keep your child out of the measuring cups and have something fun to play with for a long time. I would recommend from age 5 or 6 months to at least a year and a half, maybe longer.
+1	Great first &#34;real&#34; toy for a baby. My son played with those cups for hours when he was 8-10 months. Recently, he does not stack cups but he throws them from top of the stairs and he has so much fun. Great toy! Every baby should have it.
+1	fun to bang, fun to eat, fun to carry! easy wash and put away. We didnt know that they had cut outs and numbers but its cute.
+1	My daughter loves these, especially in the bath.  She is fascinated by the water coming out of the holes in the bottom and never seems to tire of collecting them all around her and putting them in her mouth.  She also splashes the water with them and bangs them together.  TOTALLY worth the $.
+1	I just love these cups. My grandson loves them as much as my children did. Bath, play chewing it works all day long!
+1	Classic toy that my daughter plays with all the time.  When she was younger she loved to knock down the stacks of cups we would build for her.  Now that she is older (15 months) she loves to nest the cups inside one another.  They are great in her water table as well and I'm sure will be just as fun in sand.  The 2 smallest cups are pretty small and will most likely get lost under furniture, but such is life with a toddler.
+1	My son has been playing with these since 8 months old and its his favorite toy. He will cry if his stacking cups are not around!Colorful, easy to stack from big to small or small to big order, he loves to knock them over.Durable, I've washed these in a bleach solution several times and they hold up great. Also can be cleaned in the dishwasher!
+1	My 12 month old loves these.  She plays with them a variety of ways - nesting them, knocking down stacks I build, crawling around with them on her hands, and more!  I think this is a simple toy that encourages her to use her imagination during play time.  She consistently goes for them often during play times.Each cup has a number on the bottom and they have tiny holes cut into bottom to correspond with the number - so 3 has 3 triangles, 4 has 4 squares, etc.Overall a great purchase, especially for the price!
+1	The label states this product was tested for lead and BPA. Since there is no regulation for these things who knows how accurate this is. But the cups are well made and the colors are vibrant. cute simple toy.
+1	We like these so much we have two sets. One for the tub and one for the toy box/travel. My 10 month old likes the holes in the bottom when we play with these in the tub and she like to knock them down when you stack them on the floor. Lately she's figure out how to stack them inside of each other. Great, simple, inexpensive learning toy. :)
+1	We purchased these for our 16-month old toddlers.  I don't know why we waited so long.  For months, every time they played with these at their Grandparent's house or Aunt's and Uncle's house, this was always the first toy they gravitated towards.  Anyway, here's my likes and dislikes:Likes-* easy to stack cups inside one another* need to stack cups in exact descending order in order to create a tower (if you don't stack the number 7 cup, the number 6 cup will not sit correctly on the 8)* it's top rack dishwasher safe!  Woo hoo- so if you have kids like mine, they pretend they are drinking out of the cups, you don't have to be hand washing the cups all of the time* develops concentration and fine motor skillsRecommendations/Wish List-* I wish they would have chosen primary and secondary colors, and ordered the cups according to the color wheel* I find it odd that they didn't include ten cups, there are only eight in the set&lt;&lt;Hello Auntie>>
+1	After ordering these a few months ago we just took them out for my 8 month old to play with.  She can't reassemble them yet but she loves pulling them apart when they're all stacked up.  The cups on their own are also interesting to her, which surprised me because they don't really do anything.  She definitely enjoys chewing on them, though, and they're actually great for training her to army crawl because they often roll away from her grasp, but not as far or as fast as a ball does.  She ends up chasing them across the floor.
+1	My daughter has a great time playing with these cups.  We have like 2 of the cups in each room for her to play with.  They are also great in the bathtub as she likes to scoop up the water but because they have holes the water drains out before she can try to drink it.
+1	Who would have thought? These are inexpensive, there are a bunch of them in case I misplace some there are more and our grand baby has loved them since four months of age and she at 10 months still loves them. She first liked to hold one then there were two, one for each hand. Very quickly they were fun to bang together and still are. Then we discovered they were fun in the bath tub. Heaven knows what they will do next but you can't go wrong with them.
-1	These outlet covers are a complete waste of money. They are perfectly designed for little fingers to pull out.  My daughter has an easier time pulling these out than my husband and the tab sticks out in a way that makes pulling it out tempting for her. Bare outlets would be safer.
-1	Trust me they figure out how to get them out of the outlets.  Get the old fashion one that us parents have a hard time getting out.
-1	Absolutely the worst!  The little notches on the side are baby finger sized and they come right out.  Buy the old school kind for REAL safety!!!
+1	My daughter suffered with serious colic during her first three months.  These bottles saved the day.  They really do work, and trust me, it is worth it to spend a little more time cleaning the bottle for the peaceful tranquility that you will have because your newborn isn't up screaming with stomach pains.  Granted, not all babies need this, but my daughter certainly did.  Once you get into the habit of cleaning them, it's no big deal.  Plus, once your baby gets ready for cereal, the Dr. Brown's Y-cut nipples are wonderful.  I don't know if they sell them online, but I get them at the local BRU store.  These bottles are a little expensive, but I would have paid twice the price for the relief that these bottles gave my daughter.
-1	I heard so many good things about these bottles, and after no success with the also praised Avent system, I switched to Dr. Brown's. I had no luck with this product, either, and there were more parts to clean with this feeding system. My 2-month-old son spits up even more after feeding (sometimes twice) with the Dr. Brown bottles. I have not noticed any less gas, either, and the nipples flow way too fast for him, even though I purchased the smallest size. I'm glad this product has worked for others, but for me, it was an expensive and failed experiment.
+1	Love these bottles! I'm primarily breast feeding but, when I have to use bottles, these work great. Very little (if any) air gets to baby & baby seems to have no trouble transitioning between these bottles & natural nipples.  They do have a few pieces but, are easy to disassemble, clean up easily in the dishwasher & reassemble very quickly. Very durable & no leaks while drinking (although I have noticed that they will leak sometimes if they're in the diaper bag & it gets turned upside down).  Highly recommend!
+1	It is true that these bottles have quite a few parts to clean, but I consider it totally worth it.  My son has had less gas since we've been using these bottles.  I've never had a problem with them leaking.  There's a line on them that you're not supposed to fill past, as long as the milk isn't filled past that line you shouldn't have a leaking problem. My son loves the nipple, as a previously breastfed baby it was easy for him to transfer to this bottle.  As another reviewer mentioned, don't even bother buying the 4 ounce bottles.  At two months my son is already at 5 ounces, so we barely got any use out of them.  The 8 ounce bottles are all you need.
+1	In the beginning, my son had a terrible time with gas bubbles in his stomach.  Within a few minutes of eating, he would scream in pain.  He was difficult to burp, so no help there.  We tried the Avent bottles, which only made the situation worse given the odd shape of the nipples.The FIRST time we used a Dr. Brown's bottles we noticed a significant difference.  In a very short time, he was no longer screaming after every meal.  Yes, there are 2 extra pieces to wash, but that's trivial compared to the alternative.
+1	I love these bottles!  My 3 month old baby has never had a problem with spitting up or having too much gas.  In fact, I can count on one hand the number of times he has spit up.  Yes, there are some extra parts to clean and that can get annoying, but it really only takes a few extra seconds.  And, yes, when the inner tubing gets full, it might leak a little, or the opposite happens--nothing comes out.  But, like the other reviewer said, just unscrewing it and putting it back in fixes this.  The extra time cleaning and putting together these bottles is definitely worth having a happy baby that doesn't spit up!
+1	I bought these bottle and Evenflo bottles when my son was born.  What a big difference.  With the Dr. Brown's my son had no problems with gas, burping, or anything.  They have more parts to clean, but it is a small price.  With the Evenflo bottles he kept gulping it to fast and would choke, he had the hiccups a lot and you could here the bottle making a "vacuum" noise.  After just two days, I threw away the Evenflo's and bought more Dr. Brown's and have had no problems.  My son had not problems going from breast to bottle.  Best buy ever.
+1	I used the Avent bottles for expressed breast milk; the #1 stage nipple took my daughter 45 minutes to finish and the #2 stage nipple took her only 15 minutes but she had horrible gas pains after the feeding. I read the reviews of these bottles and purchsed one to try it out and it worked like a charm. It took her only 15 minutes and no gas pains and very little spitting up! I am selling all my avent bottles on ebay!
+1	For the first few days of my son's birth, we had the wide-neck Avent bottles which leaked, the nipples gave him suction blisters on the lips, he needed extensive burping and he would find it difficult to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in those bottle.  Dr Brown's bottles solved all these issues.I have six bottles and it takes me less than 20 minutes to wash them by hand.  It takes some getting used to washing the small parts, but it's worth the extra effort.  The small brush which comes with the starter kit is essential to clean the small parts.  A regular bottle brush is fine for the bottles themselves.  Save yourself the money and go straight for the 8oz bottles.  The starter kit comes with Level-1 nipples.  You will likely need to graduate your baby to Level-2 niplles at 3-months of age and Level-3 nipples at 6-months of age.  Y-cut nipples are also available for thicker liquids (cereal mixed in milk).If you leave expressed breast-milk in these bottles in the refigerator, the fat tends to stick to the vent (just as a FYI).  Use the travel-discs when transporting milk and there will be no leaks.  My baby hardly needs burping with these bottles, they are that great (he doesn't have reflux by the way).  The caps snap on loudly which is the only con I can think of.I highly recommend these bottles. I've suggested these bottles to two of my friends whose babies have refulx and they have seen an improvement.  Try some other websites, which have better prices and offer the 9-pack variety.  If you're paying shipping, might as well get some extra small brushes, you'll need them.  One lasts for about 6-8 weeks.
+1	These bottles worked great for us.We started out with the Avent bottlesand our baby developed colic for about two weeks-switching to Dr. Brown's bottles really helped.The colic stopped within the week and we have notlooked back.  The only negative thing thatwe have experienced with these bottles has been that theyhave leaked at times. As long as you are careful how you place the top filtration piece- it should be fine.
+1	We tried Avent first and my son never could drink from that big nipple very well.  I breastfed too he was good on both the bottle and breast.  When we used bottles Dr. Brown seem to cause less gas and he enjoyed them better.
+1	When my son was born, we tried sampling bottles from several different manufacturers, including Evenflo, Triflow, Avent, etc. Dr Brown's bottles really are the best in preventing gas, bottle leakage, and flow problems. We ended up throwing all other bottles away. I had read other reviews about the small parts being difficult to wash, but I don't really have a problem with that. We don't have a dishwasher and I end up hand washing everything. Each set of bottles comes with a tiny brush for getting into the small spaces for the inner parts to the bottles; and a regular bottle brush works fine with the bottles themselves. I can wash and fill 9 bottles in under 20 minutes (perfect timing when putting my son down for a nap). As to some reviewers complaints about leakage, it's true that if the inner tube gets full sometimes the milk can leak out the top - but this has only happened rarely and I've found that if I unscrew the cap and pull out the inner tube then put it back in, the problem is resolved.  The adjustment takes less than a minute and like I said, I've only had it happen once or twice.  Otherwise the bottles, nipples and all the parts are really durable - especially the nipples.  When we first bought the bottles, we bought all these replacement nipples in level 1 and had to return them because we never needed them.  So, my only suggestions are1.  hold off on buying extra nipples to see if you really need them (or at least don't open the package until you need to) and2.  to bypass getting 4 oz bottles and go right for the 8 oz bottles. We started off with the 4 oz bottles and now, at 3 months old, our son is already up to 6 oz at a feeding. So, we had to pack away the 4oz bottles and go out and buy a bunch of the larger size.
+1	My son has GERD and has done very well with these bottles and Enfamil A.R.. They do reduce spit up. We tried the cheap Gerber bottles for a month while we were traveling, and he spit up volumes. Once we were settled and switched back to Dr Brown, the spit up stopped.
+1	i don't think they are any better then platex drop in's. just they have more parts to clean.
+1	This bottle does have a lot of parts to clean but if you weigh the options of spending about an extra 10 minutes per day cleaning bottle and your baby having less gas, it is worth it. This bottle has 5 parts to clean and others usually have about 3. So if you clean 8 bottles per day and the Dr. Brown's bottles have 2 extra parts, that is like cleaning 16 extra parts per day. Really, it takes maybe 10 seconds per extra part. So, what is an extra 2-3 minutes. Nothing!! Everyone says, yes they are great bottles but there are so many parts to clean. Really, think about it. It doesn't take that much longer to clean! I will stand by these bottles all the way...less gas, less smacking when he eats and a happier baby in the end. And, I have tried every bottle including, Avent, Playtex vent air, MAM and others. Also, get the 8 oz bottles right away. If you spend the money on the smaller bottles because you baby only eats 4 oz now, he/she will be eating more in a few weeks/months and then you will have to buy more bottles. 3oz fits into an 8 oz bottle so why not just get the larger bottles right away.
+1	My son had quite a bit of colic and gas when he was first born.  We tried all the other bottles and had settled down with the Avent which were okay.  However, my Mom spoke to a friend who had had similiar problems with her baby and she recommended the Dr. Brown's.  We purchased some and we were impressed.  After two days he was less gassy and actually slept through the night.  I would highly recomeend these bottles.
-1	I bought these because my daughter was a spitter. She would always get to much air and spit up half of what she ate. So I bought these to try and she hated them. I have also tried the Avent and she got to much ait with those too. The ones she likes and works best are the playtex nursers. You can puch the air out so you dont have to worry about it. plus she was easier to burb. I wouldnt recommend these or avent.
+1	These bottles are great if you have a colicky baby.  People complain about the extra pieces being a pain to wash.  If you put them in the dishwasher, it's not that big of a deal.  Even washing them by hand is not difficult.  These bottles get rid of the air bubbles almost entirely which helps when your child has reflux or is really gassy.  My child had reflux and we had to put rice cereal in these bottles as well...if you have to do that, then you need the Y-cut nipples as well.  Great bottles.
+1	I admit, I was extremly skeptical... my mother actually bought these for me b/c my preemie son was in pain all of the time from gas and the only thing that slightly helped was the Playtex Nursers, and he was still in pain a lot of times. We tried everything to help him. Then she brought me these.. and he has not had a problem since... My son is a happy baby again!!!! I am so happy with these. I read on here that cleaning them is a pain.. but that is just not so. I hand clean bottles anyways and it is so simple to clean these bottles, I can't believe that ppl are so lazy as to complain about a couple extra seconds to run a brush in 3 holes. Gimmie a break. I also clean a bunch of parts for my pump, so I just do it all at once. OH!!! And these bottles fit on my Medela pump, so I can just pump right in the bottle!!!! And we havent had any leaks, btw... these things are GREAT. Oh, and they also make a widemouth version that you can get at Babies R Us... just in case you prefer them. I wish I had gotten these earlier.. my son is 7 weeks (he was born at 32 weeks, btw) and he is a different baby with these bottles.OH!! And if you would rather, the bottles and all parts fit in the munchikin dishwasher basket.. even the sraws can be put in the straw things on the side of it!!! just discovered that...
-1	My mother purchased this for me from TJmaxx or Ross or something.  I've learned to be very suspicious of baby products from those places- seems like they've usually had some sort of issue and no one will buy them any more and sometimes those issues are dangerous like with this product.I think this blender is pointless.  One could do much better buying a small food processor from Target or something.  This Dex one is also cheaper at walmart online.  This blender is weak, doesn't blend very quickly or efficiently.  I'm horrified to read the reviews and learn about the plastic ring which I cannot find in mine!  I guess I fed my baby plastic!  Mine's been sitting in a plastic bag ready to go to Goodwill.  Maybe I should just throw it away.It's a piece of junk that ends up in Ross because it's a poorly designed product.  Do your baby a favor and buy a BPA free one somewhere else, and freeze your baby food in tiny Pyrex.
+1	I like this little processor for mixing up small quantities of food.  True, it doesn't hold a ton, but I does what I bought it for - I make a few days worth at a time.-  Holds about 8 oz of food comfortably at a time (so it mixes well, etc)-  I think this is a good size to make fresh food and to try new foods (without making a bunch if it's not a hit!)-  Pretty easy to clean-  Just 4 parts, so easy to assemble and use-  It's not super heavy duty, so I do chop things up a good amount before putting them in thereAll in all, I think it's worth it.  I didn't have a regular food processor and for me a blender just didn't work quite right and I thought it was harder to get the food mixed.Some hints I also found when investigating making baby food are:-  After mixing if you want to freeze any, just use ice cube trays.  Each cube is about 1 oz and once they're frozen, pop them out and put in a zip-loc for storage.-  If you're just getting started, I thought this website was useful and had good ideas - -  wholesomebabyfoodGood luck!
+1	I think that this food processor is a bit small for when you want to do big batch of food but I love it because :1. It gives a really smouth purees2. It's easy to clean (diswasher !!!)3. Usefull even with toddlers who are not always comfortable with meat.
+1	I was very impressed on how fast it was delivered, in less than a week  - product was well packed.It doesn't look excatly like the picture, there are some visible "bolts" and the finish is alright, the bolts look ok with the style - the greatest feature is the fact it doesn't close automatically so it is safe for children, which is what I need.It's good for a kid room but I would not put this in a living room as again the finish is not great but for the price, I can't complain - overall I would recommend it for a kid room.
+1	Purchased this less than 1 month ago and had my husband put it together. He spent a bit of time and one of the last steps was screwing in the hinge but it just would not go through! The problem seemed to be the pre-drilled holes were not lined up and the screws were very cheap that he ended up stripping them easily. We sent it back without a fuss from Amazon and decided I wanted to give it one more go because I loooooooooved the look so much.2nd time around:B-E-A-UTIFUL!!!!!!!!! It is simply gorgeous and went so well with our living room decor you wouldn't realize it has toys in it. It's big enough for all the living room toys and my 1 year old son can fit in it so I hope one day he'll enjoy playing IN it too! The hinge works fine although the top does not come down all the way (maybe 1 inch gap, you can push it down but it will pop back up if that makes any sense)...but this is not a big issue for me. It just means my son won't ever be trapped and it's quite unlikely he'll ever crush his fingers in closing it.OVERALL:Attractive looking piece at an attractive price.Not the finest quality but better than a plastic look (for me)(although durable) and it's not particle board either so I would expect it to hold up for quite some time.
+1	Had to put it together and it was not complicated took about 30 minutes. I was alone. The beauty speaks for itself. There is a lot of room for my twins toys. I really love the safety feature on the lid so it will not slam down on little hands their safe.. We really LOVE this toy box. This will last them until they're grown. It is a deep dark espresso and has a measurement of 31 " L by 17-" D by19-" H .Has a very nice shine on it. We are very happy with our toy box!!!!  My daughters LOVE their toy box of course their the one who picked it out!
+1	This was very easy to put together and is good quality for the price. It feels sturdy and heavy and I'm sure it will serve its purpose for many years. The lid does not shut all the way but I believe it's because the spring needs to settle in over a little time. No big deal and not noticeable. There were no scuffs scratches or dents in the paint/wood which I find to be a common issue with theses types of products.
-1	It looks nice for the moment after it's assembled. Within a short amount of time you will realize it is very cheaply made,the nice dark paint will chip off & the hinge (which they claim will make it safer) will break. It looks nice if it is not touched or used, but don't count on it lasting AT ALL when the kids start using it!!!! Return time is short as well FYI, huge waste of money
+1	This is a great toybox. However, 3 pieces came damaged. replacement of the pieces was easy - you order it online. The pieces came damaged because not enough protective packaging was used. Nonetheless, once all the replacement pieces arrived, it was easy to assemble.
+1	The playtex nurser is the only system my son will use.  He rejects all other bottles.  The drop-ins are easy to use, and keep a shape so you can accurately measure liquids, and easily handle them.
+1	These drop ins have been a lifesaver for feeding time with my infant.. It really cuts down on the bottle washing as these liners are easily disposable after the feeding and they help with infusing extra gas into your baby.A+
+1	It is supposed to have a convenient dispenser bottom. There are two perforations which would be great except they are not shaped like the liners and when you pull them through the bottom they get all scrunched up. Other than that...I love these. I use them with my playtex milk storage rings and connect to my breast pump...so easy to use, put the cap on and refrigerate or freeze. Baby also has less gas with the drop in liners than with the bottles. I stopped using bottles for breast milk and just use these exclusively. I recommend.
+1	have been using the playtex system with my second daughter (who would not take any other bottle). the liners are handy, like the fact that they are bpa free and that you can switch them out.
+1	these liners are great. Easy to use and fit into all of our four oz playtex drop in bottles. The price is right too! Esp if you have amazon prime and get free two day shipping!
+1	Makes preparing milk bottles and feeding the baby so easy, my husband never complains when it's time for him to get a bottle ready and it's easy to store
+1	I love the whole Playtex Nurser system.  I became incredibly prone to blocked ducts when pumping and feeding some bottles became a part of our routine.  I had tried other systems, and the Playtex one, by far, was the best.  These liners are thin enough to manipulate easily, but also durable.  We have never had one leak in the diaper bag!
+1	I love the playtex dropins system.  Always just need to make sure that I have enough liners.The pricing is good (it's worth 4 cents to me to not have to wash a bottle!).  And the product is secure.Very very occasionally it leaks if I put it in carelessly and didn't make sure the liner was solid and not a bit crumpled.  But that's my fault.  Overall, no complaints.  Even the pricing is fair.
+1	Convenient and useful and everyone knows it. Daddy loves them. They're his go-to 'bottles' for feeding LO. We reach for these when we travel, and bring only one nurser and a couple nipples. They don't take up much space as well, especially if you stack them in the nurser.
+1	These wall hanging are well made and are so light weight you can put them up with a tack. Very cute!
+1	Matches the nursery with the bedding so perfect. They are pretty big pieces too, which is great! They are too precious!
+1	We have a the NoJo Jungle Babies 6-piece crib set as well as the wall stickers and these hangings.  The hangings are great for the nursery with interesting characters, great colors, and a mixture of fabrics for depth and texture.  They are made from the same materials as the comforter so match perfectly.  They can be thrown in the washing machine when they get too dusty and hold up well.
+1	My little guy was getting too big for the normal plastic baby tub and I am not quite ready to have him be on his own in the tub right now.  I like that I can &#34;be in control&#34; a little bit more with this bath tub.I really wish that I would have gotten this when he was 4-5 months old when he could sit upright by himself.I make sure that I rinse it out and hang it up immediately so that it can start drying out.  So far, I have not noticed any musty smell.What I also like about this is my son burnt his foot and we were having to elevate it and keep it out of the water for awhile.  This tub was perfect.  Since the sides are soft (think bean bag chair) we propped his foot up on the side and he left it there because it was cushiony.  I also like that I can lay him down to rinse out his hair and he is comfortable and doesn't fight it like he did in the plastic tub.You can't go wrong with this purchase!
+1	Made in the USA! I love this bath!!! We were using a bath "chair/sling" type thing and I always felt that my daughter was going to slip out of it and into the tub so I was constantly readjusting her. And forget my husband trying to bath her...that was just not going to happen. I love this tub and so does my daughter. She loves that she can sit up and not slip and slide around. Her toys all stay within her reach and in front of her. I love that it is filled with beads instead of an air filled tub. I have never had problems with mildew or any strange smells. We rinse it off with the shower nozzle after her bath and hang it from the shower curtain rod to dry. It is always dry by the next day. It was definitely worth the price!
-1	Honestly, we never took this out of the package and I ended up selling it for much less than I paid. We had bought it thinking it would be another fun gadget, but actually having it in our home made us realize how big and bulky this was. It's filled with those styrofaom type bead things so it would definitely need to be aired out and dried between every bath but I still think it'd accumulate mold/mildew relatively quick.
+1	This tub is great, not sure why people had to give it bad reviews. Tub doesn't float with the baby in it and my son loved it! Not once did it slide and he loved hitting the tub and hearing the sound of the beads inside. Very roomy tub and I even use it as a play pad after it is done drying. It helps sit him up and even if he slides the bumper sides are awesome. You can have baby on their tummy to wash their back comfortably.
+1	I can't take a point off for its bulkiness since it's not a hidden attribute.  However, it is a nice bathing unit for my little guy, now that he sits up in the tubby.  I like that it offers a cushy support should he tip over.
+1	My son is about 15lbs and just over 25 inches.  He fits perfectly in this lying down.  It supports his head and neck if he wants to lay back.  My little guy loves it.  It has a no slip bottom which I love.  Hangs to dry right on the bar in the tub.  No mildew smell so far.  We've been using it for 2 months.
-1	The picture for this product is deceiving. I thought the fabric was smooth. I is actually a cheap feeling scratchy and abrasive type material. I wouldnt want it on my bare skin. I tried my son in it once and he screamed hysterically and I haven't used it since. Its too bad because its a great size and constructed well. I was very disappointed that I couldn't use it.
+1	Best tub for newborn/infant bath time hands down!!! Wished I would have found this tub before I purchased one of those hard cold plastic tubs for my newborn. My 4month old outgrew the hard plastic tub by the time he was 3 months old and my husband and I really didn't find it safe for him anymore as he slid under the water twice with one of his Shamu-like back arches, rubbed the skin off of his pinky toe because the tub was too short, and banged his head on either side of the tub countless times with all the flopping around he was doing during his bath, which is more like play time to him. The tub arrived in a timely manner, was priced perfectly, and was ready to go straight out of the box. The first time we used the tub my 4month old fell asleep in it. It is just the right height for his head and arms to rest comfortably on during bath since he isn't able to hold his head up yet. The fact that I can bathe him by myself in the big boy tub and only have one hand on him the whole time rather than both is spectacular since we humans generally only have two hands. Once out of the tub you just drain the water from the big tub, squeeze out as much water from the cushioned tub and hang it up to dry in a well ventilated area. We just hang it from the shower head to drip dry and if needed I transfer it to one of the chairs in our kitchen which is under a ceiling fan to ensure it is completely dry to prevent any mold or mildew growth between baths. This tub makes bathing a slippery and wiggly infant so much easier and safer especially during shampooing and rinsing which I dreaded in his old plastic tub. As we didn't purchase this tub when our child was an infant, I would still highly recommend it for anyone with or about to have a newborn. The plastic tubs and the so called newborn slings are horrible compared to the cushion and ease of use this particular tub provides during bath time. Plus, if you just want to leave your newborn/infant in his/her diaper for a sponge bath it is perfect. Just place the upside down tub on the countertop, lay your child in the bottom cushioned area, and bathe away. Definitely a must have for any first time parent who is intimidated by bath time with their newborn and/or infant. Great transitional tub too!
+1	Although they take up less space for storage I did not want an inflatable insert for the tub. We have a smaller, newborn version of a Leachco bath product that looks the same so I knew what we were getting (it is only for a recline and now that our LO is 7.5 months old I wanted something she could sit in.)Concerns voiced by others:Other people have said they were upset because it is not very tall. This is true. However, as I'm not looking for something to completely hold my baby up, just be there as a small support, this was not an issue for me. Our little girl is small and I actually kind of like that this does not go all the way to her head.Also, others said they didn't like that they had to fill the bathtub up because this doesn't hold water on it's own. I didn't find that a problem and since I don't need much water, it really didn't bother me.I like that it's not too big and that it's soft for our baby to sit against. She likes the texture of it and the fact that she can squish it. Inside are beans of some kind to hold it down.As we've only used it once, I can't say anything for how long it will last, but I really like it and so does our little girl. I was concerned about having her sit in the tub but with this I don't worry. She loves it!
-1	Not recommended,  To messy and just not worth the headache.  It was sent back after realizing it was soon to become a moldy mess.  Not worth the trouble or finding a place to store it.
+1	This was really great for my newborn daughter.  It got a little smelly despite rinsing and air drying every use.  But it had served its purpose before becoming unusable.  At 4 weeks we switched to the Primo Eurobath Tub (which is TERRIFIC).
+1	This is by far the best thing I have seen out there yet. First, I have read and tried a lot of the other items out there- the foam mats, slings, tubs.... I bought the euro tub and it may in the future be a good thing but not right now...The Safer Bather works like a contoured pillow/sponge. It will support baby on a slight incline and will keep her from rolling off either side or down. It was the most perfect thing to use when our daughter's belly button had not yet healed.Our daughter loved being placed on it when the warm water would press thru with her weight on the cushion. It also dries very very quickly and can hand up in your shower.I have even used it in our sink and it supports her perfectly!With all the others out there to choose from, this one is the best way to spend your $!
+1	I read a lot of reviews about this thing and took to heart the complaints of mildew, etc. Considering I live in the south, I was very hesitant to get this item. But decided I'd try it anyway. I'm very glad I did.Let it be known I use this mostly in the stuffiest bathroom in the house (its easier to warm for bathing an infant) and I have a BAD tendency to get distracted after the bath and come back hours later with a still soaked bather to pull out of the tub and hang somewhere to air dry. I have had this thing months now. I've never had to toss it in the wash, it still smells like new. I wash my baby every other day. I'm lazy and hang the thing in the shower itself to dry. I have had not one problem with it and I love it!
-1	I can see that it would be comfortable but it was easier to bathe without this bulky item.... Would not suggest.
+1	We have used this tub since his very first bath and he just loves it! He now splashes, kicks, and plays and never gets afraid of the tub. Its cozy and easy to use.
+1	Everyone warned us how difficult it would be to bathe baby...how wrong they were.  From day one home from the hospital, our boy has enjoyed his time in the bath, and it's because he is so comfy on this pillow.  Would recommend for sure!  Who would want to sit in a hard molded plastic thing when you can sit on a pillow!
+1	My newborn screamed through his baths until we ordered this and began to use it. Now he LOVES the bath! What a relief... This is the best bathing help I have found. It holds him securely so that I can scrub away. Keeps him warm and cozy the entire time.
+1	I ordered this for some friends off their registry list and they loved it. No complaints. Highly recommend to all.
+1	The tub I purchased was a complete waste of money. This was a lifesaver for when my boy couldn't sit up safely on his own. It just needs to be rinsed out well and hung to dry in a well ventilated area to avoid it getting moldy.
+1	When I brought my little guy home I had a mesch infant chair for his bath to use in the sink. He cried at every bath because he was cold. At about 3 weeks old we switched to this bath pad and he's been happy in the bath ever since. He is comfortable and warm and now that he's 8 months old he can sit on it and not slide around in the tub or lay back while I wash him. It's a great tool for not much money.  You do have to have a good place to hang it to dry because try as I might I can't squeeze enough water out of it to keep it from dripping while it dries but it comes with a hook that fits over the shower head so it's not much of a problem.
-1	The reason for the 1 star is because baby is not due until Dec 1 2013, and it has not been used. Mother to be is excited about it, but we won't know the thoughts until its used, then I'll re-rate it
+1	This little bathtub is GREAT.  It has a nice texture to keep slippery baby in place while you're bathing her, and it's VERY soft.  One thing that added a little extra is it comes with its own (detachable) clothes hanger, making it easy to hang dry.This also makes a great back rest for momma's bath time!
+1	I found that the idea of this bather was excellent.  Sadly, it did not fit in my sink.  I ended up using it as a cushion on the counter to dress her in.  I do not bath my baby without it.
+1	I can't say enough good things about this bather!  We bought it for our first son 2+ years ago and just bought a new one for our new baby. It perfectly and gently cradles the baby in the bathtub so that they cannot squirm out and get submerged in the water or get water in their ears, mouth, etc.  It is angled just enough so that his or her bottom half can be in a good amount of water (no one wants a cold, unhappy baby in the bath). The bather absorbs a lot of water, so if you dunk both sides into the warm water before putting the baby on it, his or her head and back is touching the warm water, which makes it nice.  Also, when you have the baby sit up to wash his hair and back his bum stays in place and he doesn't slide around, which makes bathing such a challenge otherwise.The only negative thing I would say about it (and I don't even really think it's negative) is that after about 1 1/2 years of use, including washing it periodically, it lost some of its shape and wasn't as "fluffy."  That's why we ended up buying a second one, but honestly for the price and use we got out of it, I couldn't complain about it.  Plus by 1-2 years old you don't need it anymore anyways.  It is also important to hang it up in the shower up the hanger provided after use and squeeze the water out or it can become a little bit stinky from mildew.  If you forget it's not a big deal to throw it in the washer.  We washed it periodically anyways, just to keep it fresh.I 100% recommend this product!
+1	I love this thing!  Still using it with my first child, who's now 3 months.  I've never had a problem with mold or mildew.  The fact that it comes with a hanger helps a lot for drying.  I start filling the tub while he's laying in it, and it's nice that the water starts to surround his little butt and lower back to keep him warm, but still keep him safely in place.  Since it's soft you're able to easily reach spots without having to turn the baby too much.It IS pretty small though.  Now that my son's gotten bigger, his heels can hit the bottom of the tub, though he appears to enjoy this.  I'll definitely have to upgrade at some point, but it works great for now.
+1	This is the best thing I've found in a long time.  I tried one of those cheap sponge things from [a store], and it just mildewed and was disgusting after a VERY short period of time.  I went to babiesrus which is where I should have gone in the FIRST place and there this was.  The last one too!  Boy, I just don't know what I would have done without it. Especially for a first baby and you're nervous about bathing anyway.  This thing keeps the baby warm, snug and safe in the baby tub or sink.  It just is a great thing and the baby loves it!  I try to buy one for every baby shower now but they usually run out at babies rus!  Great, great item!  One of the BEST parts is that it's WASHABLE!
+1	the bath pad is fine - seems comfy for my little guy and keeps him elevated.  but beware - do not hang it to dry until you squeeze out some of the water.  i did not do this and the cloth that wraps around the hook ripped a bit.  but it is fine to hang once some of the water is squeezed out.
-1	I got this sponge bath thing hoping to replace the bulky hard blue bathtub but turns out that this thing is just awkward for newborns. I put this in my kitchen sink (a large one) and put nice warm water just filled up enough to be comfortable. I used it with my newborn (less than a month old) and the water got cold ultra fast, the sponge took forever to dry, was heavy and the incline was weird for my newborn. I think I will try it again when he gets a little older but for little tiny babies,....not so much. It's sitting in storage.
+1	My infant loves lounging for his bath!  It is plush, it helps retain the warmth of the water around him, and is much easier to use and store than a giant baby tub!
+1	I have used this product nearly every other day for over three months and it works well. I have not had a problem with it smelling or becoming moldy and I live in a very hot and humid climate. My only complaint is that I wish the part for my child's head was elevated a little more so water would not get in her ears. I could put less water in the tub but then she gets too cold too quickly.
+1	I just bought this because my daughter is getting too big for her plastic tub. She loves it! It is very soft and seems very comfortable for her, and she stays warm. Dries quickly. Highly recommend!
-1	Follow the instructions to the letter - this product will still smell bad after a few uses.  I HATE IT!!!  I've gone through 3 bathing things so far - and this is my least favorite.  First, it doesn't have much elevation for newborns.  Second, it gets heavy once it's wet and flattens.Alternate product recommendation - Sure Comfort Tub by The First Years.... now THAT is a good baby bathtub!!!
-1	I ordered this because I don't have a lot of storage space and thought this bath would be easier to store than a big plastic tub. It arrived sealed in plastic but when I attempted to use it for the first time black dirt seeped out. I have attempted to wash it 3 times through the washing machine and still get black dirt.
+1	I received this as a baby shower gift. Our little guy preferred this over the standard plastic baby tub. I think it's probably more comfortable for him. No hard plastic poking him. Also easy to wash his hair with him laying in this. Bath time became much more enjoyable once we started using this!Our little guy is 4 months old now and really stretches over the bottom so I think we'll only be able to use this another month or so. Well worth the price!
+1	I registered for and received the Eurobath by Primo, but my daughter was just a little too small for the tub. I purchased the safer bather and sat in the bath tub with her... she loved it! She seemed so much more comfortable than in the hard plastic bathtub, and much more stable as well. Now we are making the transition to the Eurobath, which I recommend now that she's a little bigger. But, we still have the safer bather for our baths together!
-1	Pro:-Spongy holding around your baby to create more safety if bathing baby in ceramic sink.Con:-Always need 2 adult to bath your baby. One holding baby's head up so water won't get into baby's ears, and the other person give the actual bath to the baby.-The mildew smell(I try to hang it dry over night in the bathroom cause it soaks lots of water and keep dripping. Than remove to somewhere under the sunlight during the day time, to get it complete dry out for next bath. However, without drying under the sunlight(when its cloudy day....it has mildew smell)After 3 month usage, the spongy getting flat...and the whole thing keeps sinking(the head part used to be higher...but now about 2 inches flatter)...my husband now has to hold the baby's head plus holding up the hook towards outside the sink... it's totally useless now and I'll have to buy something else...
+1	This worked for giving our newborn sponge baths, but I ended up getting a tub with a newborn insert when it came time for giving real baths. Overall, I wouldn't buy it again.
+1	Works really well in the tub... holds the baby secure, absorbs water so it stays warm and dries pretty quickly.  And the prices is nice!
+1	The best tub - no slipping, she stays warm, and you don't have to hold her the entire bath time. Just throw it in the wash one in a while and make sure to hang dry. Way better than a sponge bath tub that falls apart and mildews or a cold, slippery plastic tub. We love it!
+1	Love this products. Baby tubs are so silly, overpriced and dont use them very long. This is perfect because you can use it as a baby or just as a bath toy later. The baby really goes with it. I will never by a baby bath tub again. Dries nice and easy to fit anywhere.
+1	I started out with an infant tub & one that has an insert to lay the baby on.  The plastic arm kept collapsing, dumping my week old baby in the water, even though I had a hand on him at all times.  It wouldn't stay up.  I bought this as a replacement.  It sits directly on the bottom of the tub & I only run enough warm water to submerge his bottom & legs.  He likes it much better & doesn't cry now when it's bath time (He's 13 weeks old now).  It's soft & absorbs the warm water, which is much more comfortable for him.  It does get a mildew smell if it doesn't dry properly, but that's solved by washing it every week or so on gentle cycle.  Once he's able to sit up, I'll go back to the infant tub (without the insert).  And this product meant to go in a tub not a sink, unless you have a large sink.  It's been great so far!
-1	I got this awhile ago for my first son. it was a great idea, and he loved it, but man did it STINK! no matter where or how soon I hung it up to dry. outside, inside, febreezed... any of it. plus immediately after the bath it's a huge pillow soaked with water, so it's heavy and not too convenient. we also lived in a super SMALL house in philadelphia with no good spot to store it. we've since switched to theSummer Infant Fold N' Store Tub Time Bath Slingand it's been through 2 kids and I'm about to use it for one more. it's convenient and folds and best of all doesn't STINK like mildew! blech! don't waste the money, you'll end up buying something else anyway!
+1	We ordered this before our son was born (he is now two months old) and I am overjoyed with this bathtub solution. We have used it both in the sink and the bathtub. Due to the size you do need a larger sink. It has worked perfectly- it cradles the baby while still allowing the water to surround him or her. It does absorb water during the bath which must be drained out of it but it is so comfy and there is nothing hard or slippery which was important to me because wet babies are slippery enough. I also like that you could use this to give a sponge bath before the cord falls off. Lastly, I love that it is made in America.
+1	This simplified bathing our baby by 100 times.  with the traditional hard tubs with the incline and hard plastic, i was always afraid to have my baby slip on mine or my husband's hands.  When we received this, bathing became enjoyable instead of a nervous event.  The baby seems to enjoy bathing more too, as the material absorbs warm water and is soft and secure feeling.  We place the bather in the infant tub on our bed for easier bathing.  After we are done, my husband rinses and rings the bather for it to dry.  I have thrown the bather in the washer a few times too with no problems.  It did develop a mildew smell after awhile but a soak in diluted vinegar in the baby's tub for a couple of hours kills all the smell. Great product.
+1	I used this to wash my baby in the sink until she was about three months old and no longer fit. I still use it occasionally to lay her on the bathroom floor when she won't let me get ready in peace :) It does get moldy so needs to be washed and it has started to pill but it served it's purpose.
+1	This is the perfect bath for an infant. I love fact that it's soft instead of hard plastic which allows is to soak up warm water fast and is comfy for baby.It dries out very quickly and doesn't mildew.
+1	Good sponge, compared to the 5$ one we got. Much more fluffy. But takes a while to dry. We bathe every night and hang it in the tub in between to dry - which it does! Getting small/short for my 4mo old tho...
+1	At first I had purchased one of those plastic tubs thinking that is what everyone else gets, so I must need it.  Then I started thinking... how long am I going to need it for? and after that where in the world am I going to store this huge plastic tub??  That's when I started searching for a solution - this was it!  I'm sooo glad that I returned that huge plastic tub.  This pad was perfect.  It fit in our kitchen sink perfectly and when our little one grew out of the sink we used the pad in the bath tub.  It was easy to ring out real quick and I just hung it up in the tub to dry out.  It never got a "moldy" smell like other reviews have said - maybe they didn't have enough air circulation around it?  The only thing I don't like is that after using it so much the fabric has sort of stretched out a bit from hanging (it's heavy with the water in it).  It's really not a big deal though because it is still fully functional.  Now that my little one doesn't use the pad anymore, I've dried it out and it hangs in the closet until the next kid (?).  My friends are wondering why they got this huge plastic tub they only used for a few months...
+1	Wouldve been perfect from newborn up. My son is 29inches long and 19lbs; wish it was a bit bigger but it still holds my son and hes getting used to kicking them legs and spashing in the water while i wash him; which is good.. i like this better than the big bulky plastic tubs.
-1	This was a great concept, however once you put this in the water dont expect to be able to move it.  Its to heavy.  It offers no support.  So once you are done bathing baby, this will not lift out of the tub and if you want to take a bath with your baby this wont allow for fluid movement in the tub.  It takes 3 days to dry out and is so thick you cant squeeze the water out.  When you hang this to dry, it feels like a ton of bricks.  It is also a very scratchy material.  It will do but it is really not as good as all the reviewers make it sound.  Also this does not in any way elevate the babys head.  Once this gets wet, water gets around babies head.  Also, when added to tub of water, the water soaks into the material but doesnt stay warm.  Baby is left on top very cold.  You can not submerge this in the water even a little, bcs if you do, her head will get wet (no elevation) and it floats upward as well.  Not a good bather.Makes a good place to lay baby on when she gets out of tub...
+1	This really worked great for my baby from day one. I used it until she was about 6 months. It is a really nice, comfortable pad and I think my baby enjoyed using it. The only thing that I didn't like as much was when she got to be about 4.5-5 months she would slip down and I would have to keep re-positioning her. But that didn't bother me too much. I still really like this product and would recommend for new babies.
+1	It is far the best and most comfortable pillow for bathing! Our son is so relaxed and loves his bath time!
+1	This bath pad is perfect for bathing a newborn. It dries easily and is convenient to store (there's a hook for you to hang the bath pad). It is thick and soft and feels comfy. I did put this in the washing machine, which I shouldn't have because after that one time machine wash, it started showing wear as if the bath pad has been used for a long time.
+1	We had one of these for our first baby. Now that #2 is on the way, I purchased another. For us, it's perfect. Our bathroom counter has two sinks, so their isn't enough counter space for a standard plastic baby tub. We have a two-story home, and don't want to lug baby bath stuff down to the kitchen, only to trek back upstairs to the bedroom. This works great. It keeps baby secure, fills with warm water, is inexpensive and doesn't take up a lot of space. I imagine it could get moldy if left in a damp environment, but ours never did, and we used it for more than a year. However, we wrung it out as much as possible after use, and hung it from the shower head, so it could drip dry and had air circulation.
+1	I bought this for our infant son after reading the glowing reviews on this site.  People are right!  This is a must-have!  We've used this for about four months now and it makes bathing our baby so simple.  It holds him comfortably and I never end up with back strain.  The Safer Bather also dries very easily.  A great product!
+1	The product is great.  Comfy for my little one, easy to use, and dries fast.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.
+1	I like this a lot and so does my son. He has been a very long baby since birth and quickly grew out of the new born sling. He is now sitting up on it and it is still great. If you put too much water in the tub it will float up. Getting the water out is easy just swing back and forth for most of it then hang to drip dry. Does not smell and has not molded. Hubby put a hook high on the shower wall to hang to dry. Perfect for long legged babys.
+1	I initially got this as I was reading the reviews people now being able to bath their little one by themselves. I was in that boat at 9 weeks it still took me and my husband to bath our son. So I ordered it... We were in a plastic tub... The first day we got it was bath night. So my husband and and I went upstairs. I had him stand back to see if I could do it by myself, and 15 minutes later I had finally bathed my 9 weeks old son... It didn't really take that long we had some "playtime/singing time" in there too.. Anyways, I LOVE this product. It isn't the cutest thing but it works wonders. We've now had it 3 weeks and I can't imagine us not having it. If you are trying to use a big plastic tub or are on a one inch thin bath sponge, make the switch, it is completely worth it.
+1	After moving out of the baby bath into the big boy tub, this cushion (plus a no slip mat) made bath time much less stressful.  I started using this when my son was about 6 months (could have started even a bit sooner) and can see using it for many months to come.  Definitely the way to go when you are ready to transition to the big tub.
+1	I went on reviews when I bought this and it is so easy to use, better than any plastic tub out there.  I have a 3 month old and have basically used the plastic tub a total of 3 times.  The big tub is just so much easier and nicer and there isn't any preparation, everything is there, it's easy to fill and drain and always worked well with my first child.  This pillow keeps my son safe and comfortable, it dries up really well and he can also lie in it on the bathroom floor while I fill the tub.  My husband can even bath him and he looks really comfy in it.  He lies snugly on it while I soap him up and don't have to worry about a slippery baby falling out my hands or hitting himself against the tub.  Well worth the money!
+1	I cannot speak highly enough about this baby product!  I love this bath pillow.  I used it when my 3 year old was a newborn and now I am using it for my new baby.  It perfectly cradles the baby during bath time...even the tiniest of babies.  We used it with my oldest son well past his first birthday.  Once he was sitting on his own we would simply have him sit on it.  We tried a bath seat at one point but it was a hard plastic and the edges were not very smooth.  He looked so uncomfortable in it (plus it was difficult to get him in and out of it).  We never had a problem with mildew or smells.  We always dried it out by hanging it in the shower after the bath.  We washed it a few different ways...sometimes in the washing machine and sometimes by simply adding Oxyclean to the bathtub and letting it sit in the solution.
-1	I bought this because it looked like a more comfortable version of the tub sponge that my mom recommended.  It does elevate the baby more than the yellow sponge, but I had a few things I didn't like about it.  First, it is very hard to lift to wring out after the bath.  The water it soaks up makes it very heavy.  Second, if you don't have all of the water wrung out of it, and don't completely submerge it into the warm water at the next bath, when the baby lays on it some of the cold water comes out and makes the baby cold.  For the longest time I couldn't figure out why my son screamed every time I laid him on the Safer Bather, and then one day I felt the cold water coming up out of it as I was bathing him.  I switched to the Sure Comfort newborn to toddler tub and he likes it so much better.  He prefers to be IN the warm water rather than on top of it.
+1	I registered and received the Safer Bather as a shower gift.  It is a wonderful product.  I gave birth to my daughter in January and have been using this product since day 1.  It was perfect for those 1st sponge baths and when her cord fell off, we started using this in the "big" tub right away. It's now 5 months later and we are still using the Bather.  Our daughter is 14 lbs 3 oz and 26 inches long and she is just as comfortable as day 1 on this bath pillow.  We have never had any problems with Mildew and I have washed in the machine on delicate cycle with no problems.  The bathtub does get heavy when it is full of water, however, if you let the water drain from the tub 1st and then hang the Safer Bather in the shower (with its included hanger) it drains and dries very nicely.I highly recommend this product, it is so worth it!!!!
+1	My daughter started out with the newborn end of the Primo Eurobath, but baby + soapy water + plastic adds up to a seriously slippery adventure. On a whim, I picked up the Infant Bath Pad and slipped it into the Eurobath behind her back -- PERFECT. She sat much more upright (but still softly cradled), and on the occasions we put her in the grown-up tub, she has an ideal, elevated cushion. A quick rinse under the faucet, and hang the Bath Pad by its hook over a laundry sink or on a shower head and it's clean and dry for tomorrow's bathtime...
+1	This bather has made bath time so easy.  I struggled for 2.5 months with the sponge then the infant tub, sling on and sling off.  How frustrating they all were.  I couldn't keep my son warm and he slid all around when inside the infant tub.  I was terrified.  This product has been great.  It does not move at all in the tub and my son stay in place on the bather.  And it keeps him warm and happy.  I've not had any problems with mildew or losing it's shape.  I give it a thorough rinse in HOT water then wring it out and hang it over the tub.  It dries pretty quickly.  Within a few hours I can move it to the closet so it doesn't interfere with my shower space.
+1	Those big plastic tubs took up my whole bathroom and were hard to store. I LOVE this bath mat. It is so easy to use and store. It is soft and my baby loves laying on it.  When you are done with the bath, just squeeze the water out and hang it on the shower head to dry. Done and out of the way.
+1	I went through many different bathtubs for my baby girl. I had a safety first tub that folded, a wire frame tub with a cloth cover that made it more like a lawnchair, a non-folding tub by safety first and then I finally broke down and tried this tub.I hated how all the others allowed my daughter to slide around and even slip down and turn sideways while bathing. This bath sponge tub is great. She does not slip slide around, I can wash her entire body much easier, and when the tub is filled properly she is nice and warm. She loves to kick and splash with her feet while in the other tubs she would squirm and start to cry.If the sponge tub starts to smell after awhile (mine did after 3 months) try to put it in the washer and then hang it in a well ventillated area. That is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 - it did smell alittle mildewy recently but now after being washed it is fine.Lets just say the other three tubs are going in the lawn sale this summer!
+1	I bought this because it wasn't made in China, was cute and fit everything I was looking for.  I really like the fact that it's big enough for little hands to fit in it.  I can put cooked veggies that tend to be slippery, in it and my 9 month old can actually pick up the food (as opposed to it sliding around not ever being picked up).  However, this advertised as "no tip over" which is another reason I bought it.  I was disappointed that on the first time trying it, my child tipped it over and the food went everywhere.  Other than that, so far it's good.
+1	I bought this item at a local specialty store and the clerk assured me the item was BPA free. When I got it home and opened it I saw the dreaded #7 recycle code on the white part. I contacted Baby Bjorn to clarify. Here is what they said:"BABYBJ&Ouml;RN and Plastic Safety: When it comes to the material used in the production of our products, we put significant effort into finding materials that meet our high standards of quality and safety. To guarantee the safety of our plastic products, all BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Kitchen and Bathroom products are tested by Specialized Technology Resources (STR), an independent global provider of quality assurance testing.

I like that this one is NOT made in China, like so many things tend to be.
-1	Spoon is too big for my son's mouth (he's 11mo old), and the look of the plate makes me feel like I'm feeding my son out of the dog bowl.
+1	My LO loves to eat with these spoons! and believe I've tried with others and he doesn't like it. Is true they are a little big bigger but if my LO loves them I love them!
+1	This plate and spoons set has been great for us.  Our daughter loves having her own plate, and we take it everywhere - restaurants, vacations, friends' homes.  It is non-slip and very stable, but not unmoveable by a determined child.  Fortunately for us, our daughter so far does not pick up the place until it is empty, so we haven't had to deal with her throwing a full plate on the floor (yet).  The rounded edges are nice for little hands, and the 3-leaf clover shape helps make scooping food easier.  The spoons are so cute, and very easy to use.  We are overall very happy with it.
-1	This plate is fine as a plate with raised edges, sort of like a cross between a bowl and a plate. But for twenty dollars give or take, it is wildly overpriced because what it does NOT do is stay put on the high chair tray. My 12-month-old son has no problem picking it up and tossing it if he so desires. The spoons that it comes with are easy to hold but a little wide for my son's mouth at this point.
+1	This plate isn't perfect but it's the best I've found. It's more weighted than the typical toddler plate and has nice round edge for scooping food out with fingers or the spoons. I like that it doesn't have sections because a lot of times my daughter is eating something like macaroni and peas that doesn't need to be sectioned. It does not claim to have suction or that you're baby wont' be able to pick it up so you need to have realistic expectations about that. If you child continually picks it up either decide the plate isn't developmentally appropriate yet and try later or enforce a no pick up rule (which I did and yes 10 month old babies can understand what no means). The thing I don't like about the plate is that it claims to have a rubber base which I envisioned as the whole bottom being rubber but it's actually only the outer edge so it does slide a bit. However since I can't find anything better I have used this plate for every meal and snack for the past couple weeks and I have to say overall I really like it. Just an FYI don't cut anything in it with a sharp knife as it does make scratch marks. I haven't had any staining problems and I've served spaghetti and blackberries in it several times (I hand wash it after every meal).
+1	I was hoping my 11mo would not pick up this plate but that was the first thing she did, and threw it on the ground :(That being said, the spoons are pretty much amazing. I can get a good amount of food on it and it easily goes into her mouth because the edges are thin.
+1	This solved the problem of our baby picking up her dish and dumping the contents out. Also, the color 'frame' has a rubber edge on the bottom, preventing it from slipping or being pushed around the table.  We were surprised that some reviewers thought it was cheap-feeling.  It is sturdy and high quality, what one would expect for the high-ish price; made in Sweden.  Not ugly like most baby stuff made these days.  So happy, we ordered another one.
+1	These are by far my favorite dishes for my Twins to eat out of and we have a lot of different bowls.My girls are able to grab more food out of these than any of their other dishes, this is due to the sloped & smooth insides.This does not slide all over their high chair tray, it stays right where I put it.It does not tip as many of their other bowls do.These are easy to clean & I hand wash them. I just un-snap the 2 pieces wash them and snap them back together when they are dry. This is VERY easy but a child would not be able to do it.These also fit together so they take up less space!!These are a little pricy but I figured since it was something we would be using EVERYDAY, several times a day, it was worth getting something that worked great and would not wear out.Several people have complained that their child is able to pick these up & throw them and are dissapointed. Ummmmm, DUH!! If your child is able to pick things up and throw them since this is not glued down, held by some magnetic force, etc. then yes, they will be able to pick it up. That is just common sense. These are just harder to pick up. Try teaching your child some manners, yes, even at 1 year old children can be taught not to do something. If you are having trouble with your child throwing their plate then perhaps you should be looking for a book on teaching your child some manners instead of trying to fix the problem with a bowl!
+1	These are my baby's all-time favorite spoons. They are wide enough to pick up quite a bit of food and get it in his mouth without (too much) mess, and soft enough on his cheeks and gums. The low, wide base of the bowl makes it very difficult to tip over. Totally worth it the price.
+1	I really like this mobile. It is much better than the ones you can get that match your nursery set. My baby loves to watch this mobile turn and the hesitation helps him to focus and study the images. It is nice to have a choice of 2 different songs sets or white noise. I have had some trouble with the remote working, but I don't use it that much so it's not that big of a problem. Also it's nice to be able to change the toys on the mobile as your child gets older. It helps them from getting tired of it. Great product!!
+1	This mobile is wonderful!  Our daughter loves the bright colored animals, and I love how it is so multi-functional.  Having interchangeable pieces is such an inovative idea, and it keeps our little Amy interested.  She also has several other toys made by Sassy, and we have been happy with all of their products.
+1	Our daughter is, was, and still is enthralled with this mobile from the time she started sleeping in her crib. She LOVES the toys that rotate on this, and as she has gotten older upon waking she is even smiling and &quot;talking&quot; to them without them moving she likes the mobile so much! At night we put it on one rotation with the ocean sound and &quot;knock on wood&quot; she always falls asleep NO JOKE. We rarely if ever use the remote, but it does work. The music is a little tinny for my husband and I, but she absolutely adores it. The way the music/waves fade is great at bedtime. And the way the mobile pauses to let little eyes focus is just right. I was a little cautious when registering for this because I thought it to be a little pricey, but with the selection of 3 sets of toys to hang for different ages it is well worth it. I would highly recommend this mobile!
+1	We love this!  The toys are wonderful.  Our six month old now has the animals on the mobile and uses the others as toy rattles.  Once she outgrows it, it can be just a music box.  After her naps we turn this on and she plays in her crib for 10 minutes or so.  Works great.  Batteries lasted a while and even then the mobile worked but we changed the batteries because it stopped responding to the remote.  Remote works from across the room as long as it can hit the receiver.  We are REALLY happy with this.  Not as cute as some of the wind up ones, but WAY more functional and much nicer than those weird symphony ones and their strange shapes and toys.
-1	I got this for my son when we visit friends and family so we don't have to drag his high chair along. We ended up having to buy a real booster seat anyway. This seat is very unstable and just isn't safe or efficient.
+1	We had our First Years Booster Seat for 10 years before the straps that hold the seat to the chair snapped from being pulled (by my husband). He always pulled the straps so the chair could be as tight as could be (although I could easily do it, but just can't get it quite as tight). We used it through 3 kids and just had another (baby), so we had to get a new one. I expect we'll have this chair for at least 2 grandkidds too since this baby will be our last.
+1	This was great in when we traveled in the hotel.  I just wish it was a little taller since some of the chairs were short and the tables taller but wonderful idea and product.
+1	We got this seat for my 6 month old. It's easy to blow up, and folds up small. We take it on trips and attach it to any chair. She loves sitting in it. We use it on our balcony as well when we sit outside and she can sit with us. Easy to clean,  great price!
+1	I have twin girls, When I would take them to a friends I would take my Bumbo seats/trays with me so I had somewhere to sit them to eat. Eventually they outgrew the Bumbos and I was either stuck holding them or had to drag my highchairs with me.Then a friend recommended these travel boosters when someone gave her one for Christmas.  I looked into them and decided to give them a try. I LOVE them.They are not teeny tiny when folded up but are small enough to keep one in a baby bag, or carry both in a stroller. Maybe the size of a large, flat lunch box? I leave them both in the car.They have a carry handle and are lightweight.It only took a few breaths to inflate the bottom portion of the seat and was just as easy to deflate when it was time to fold back up.It strapped to the chair easily and was quite stable. It wasn't wobbley or anything. It strapped in tight....granted it was a square chair seat and back. Ideal.It was way more sturdy than I thought it was going to be. The base even though inflated with air is sturdy, solid and firm. The frame is not flimsy at all and the straps are nylon.The only two things I noticed:The seat is smaller than I thought it would be. I use them with my 14mo old twins who are also on the small side and they fit perfect. Unless they hit a massive growth spurt and work their way up the percentage chart I could see them using this booster well after 2yrs old. But again, they are on the slender, small size.The second thing is the seat has small crevices which are a pain to clean smushed food out of. I took note of this after the first use and now cover the seat with a tea towel before strapping in the kiddos.Overall - LOVE. I will definitely recommend to a friend.
+1	It does its job. No issues with the connector. Our doorway was too wide and this worked out perfectly. Great.
+1	I was worried that the extension would be loose, or threaten the integrity and safety of the gate itself. But it isn't, and doesn't, and took literally seconds to snap onto the gate. Yahoo!
+1	This is just what we needed to get our gate to fit in our large doorway.  It fits fine into the gate and the quality seems to be good, specifically that it feels to be heavy duty.
+1	Unfortunately, if you have the gate... you will probably have to buy the extension.The extension itself, is very easy to install... it pretty much just side in on either side of the gate. So 5 stars for an easy install.Not much to say but it's most likely a must have product, because an average size hallway will need this extension.
+1	We needed these for both our baby gates which don't seem to come wide enough to cover a normal hallway, but this extension works perfectly and we haven't had any problems with it in over a year of everyday use.  My daughter even grabs the rails and shakes them everyday and it has held up without becoming loose.
+1	This fit just perfectly in our stairway space.  Did order the larger one and realized it was a tad too big. Quick shipping as well.
-1	This work ok... I didn't like how it fits and it should be included in the gate. Overall this gate wasn't a good one for me.. I was much happier with the Summer Extra Tall Gate
+1	We had to buy this with the Hands Free Gate because our stairway was just a smidge to wide for the gate itself.  The only issue we have come across is that the bottom bar on the gate and the extension bowed a little, we believe it is because of our shoe molding and the way our walls are, we fixed it by putting 2 little pieces of wood under the bottom bar and so far that has fixed our issue.  Other than that the extension is great.  I don't recommend using more than 1 though.
+1	We got this carrier as a shower gift, and we really like it. I have to agree with the other reviews that it's a little tricky to get baby in and out - but you get what you paid for. We thought about buying the Baby Bjorn, but I think it's too expensive for a carrier that we won't use that much anyways. So we have the Cozy Rider and also the EuroRider(also by Infantino), that is much similar with the Baby Bjorn and have a much better system for getting baby in and out - we can do it without waking the baby, and cost half of the Bjorn.So if you plan on having the carrier for occasional use only, I recommend the Cozy Rider. I used it in supermarkets, the mall, and at home too, when my baby was fussy and wanted to cuddle all the time. It does start hurting your back after a while(30-40 minutes or so), but it didn't bother me that much. The EuroRider has more padding, which helps a lot, but cost twice as much as the CozyRider(we bought it gently used though!!)So, bottom line, this is a great carrier for its price - easy to adjust and our baby loves it. If you plan on hiking or wearing it for longer periods of time, you might want to look into a carrier with more padding(like the Euro Rider or Baby Bjorn). If not, this one will do just fine!!! I recomend it.
+1	To be honest, we loved our infantino soft carrier.  We used it regularly when our babies were newborns ... but by the time my babies hit 12-13 lbs, this carrier became uncomfortable for me, pulling on my shoulders and causing me to arch my lower back - not good!  My husband still could use it till the babies hit about 15lbs, but this time around, we just went for the baby bjorn.  So - if you are looking for something for the first 2-3 months, this is awsome - the baby is snuggled and cozy against mommy's (or daddy's) chest while leaving mommy's hands free - it is great for the transition for newborns.  Again, we really liked it when our babies were small - if that's what you are looking for, this is the way to go... if you want to continue using the carrier past 3 months, I would suggest looking at the more expensive Baby Bjorn for comfort...
+1	This is a nice carrier. Baby feels really comfortable in it and falls asleep. We noticed that when we take her for a walk in it she sleeps better that night. You need two people to get her in it- that's the only downside. But once she's in it, she's super comfy!
-1	I had bought this for my son when he was a few months old.  We lived in an apartment complex on the second floor, so it was crazy to drag him and teh stroller down stairs.  I had bought this to make our daily walk to the mailboxes easy.  It worked great at first.  When he turned 4 months old I had problems.  I was packing the car to go on a trip with him in it.  IT was TOO tight around his stomach that he spit up in teh back of our SUV.  With him in it I couldn't even put two fingers between him and the carrier.  Never used it since
+1	I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent. My Grandson, at 8 months, is completely off the bottle and is taking formula, juice, and water from his "sippy cup". We are thrilled.
-1	Great bottles when used with nipples, terrible design with the sippy cup attachment.  Valves are super tough to remove for cleaning,  and they always are being cleaned.  I recommend the First Years Clean & Simple, valve free! sippy cups. They don't offer them on Babies R Us online but the do have them in the store.  They have them in 3 sizes , with handles and they don't leak!  EVER!  When making the purchase do it right the first time.  Not like me 4 sets later :o(
+1	I love the whole Avent system! These are great sippy cups, in large part because all Avent pieces are modular and fit each other. So, if you have been using Avent bottles, you can put the sippy cup tops and handles on the bottles.You can pop out the magic valve that makes this a sippy cup and fit in the nipple from the bottle. Or, you can take the collars from your bottles and fit the magic valve in it. It is wonderful! Especially since you have so many ways to fit the sippy cup together if you have already been using Avent bottles.
+1	I will first admit that there are additional parts to these cups that need to be washed, but since we used Dr. Brown's bottles, I was used to a few pieces.The soft spout on these cups is great, and made transitioning to a cup SO easy for us. My son hasn't taken a bottle since his first birthday, and never missed them a bit. There are two levels of spouts, one harder one softer. I've tried other soft spout brands, but have had leaking from the collars. Avent cups NEVER leak as long as the valves are inserted correctly. Our little guy will use any brand or spout type, but these are his favorite and nice on sore gums.I really recommend these cups despite the extra valve pieces (which I simply pop in the dishwasher in a basket). You'll never have spills on your sofa or carpet.
-1	This is not a horrible product.  Some young children find the spout easier than other sippies, and we used it as a transition sippy before switching over to the Playtex model.They will leak, but hardly in floods if our experience is any indication.  The BIGGEST drawback is that they are a real *pain* to clean.  Very difficult to clean by hand (take something else on vacation!) and not all that convenient even when you do have a dishwasher at hand.  There are just so many parts!Plus the handle and the ring thingie don't fit into our bottle washing dishwasher basket.Two stars.  You might want to try it for an older baby or toddler who is not adapting to other styles.  But otherwise give it a pass.
+1	Finally. We bought just about every kind of sippy cup on the market. Hard tops, soft tops, short, tall, you name it, we've got it. And they are currently being stored. He loved this cup. Finally, I got him to drink out of a cup. Something about the flatness of the nipple and the fact that it is soft, but not too soft and longer than most. My little man drank out of it immediately.  Hopefully, before too long, he'll be getting his juice himself! Ha Ha! We had a little problem with the Avent bottles leaking, but so far, we haven't had a problem with this cup leaking. I was a little cautious about that when I purchased this one. Because of the bottle leakage, I double check everything before I hand it over. I hate to clean and don't need any more cleaning jobs added. My advice, try this cup. It worked wonders for us.
-1	First of all, this thing dries out wipes, even if you do add the 1/4 cup of water you're supposed to add every couple of days! It also restricts you in the kind of wipes you can buy... forget getting Chubbs in its round container, for instance. The little storage area is a nice idea, but it's rather flimsy and not very supportive. Your best bet would be to get one of the wrap-around warmers, which have cute pastel designs on them and mold to the shape of the wipe tub. These take up far less room and are much easier to clean, too. This one? You'll be continuously wiping it down, when it hasn't fallen over, that is.
-1	I bought this because of the wipe warmer, but it is terrible.  The wipes at the bottom will dry out and turn brown within just a few days, and the insert for "pop-up" wipes won't stay down in the unit, so it just comes out with the wipes, making it impossible to grab a wipe with one hand.  The unit is supposed to snap on top of the organizer, but mine kept sliding off.  I gave up after a few weeks and just took the unit off the organizer, and super-glued a regular wipe container on top of the organizer, that I just keep buying refills for.  My baby doesn't seem to mind cold wipes.I still use the organizer, though, and I like it.  It says that it holds about 20 diapers, but when your baby is little, and using diapers through size 2, you can turn them sideways so that you can actually fit in twice as many in two rows instead of just one.  They slide out easily and never seem to get stuck in the netting.  The little pockets on the side are handy for a tube of diaper rash ointment, etc.
+1	We received this as a gift and love it! It warms the wipes nicely. When we use unwarmed wipes my baby gets more upset at changes. Perhaps we are spoiling him. ;-) He is a winter baby so I'm sure he appreicates our efforts to keep his tushy warm.The only time I have had problems with wipes drying out is when I have over filled it and the lid doesn't close tightly or I have accidently left it open. When that happens, I have just added a bit of water and it restores them nicely. I found that the bottom wipe does turn brown but only when I keep adding the fresh wipes to the top and the bottom ones were older. Now I remove the whole remaining stack and add new ones to the bottom. Even if they are slightly brown, it just looks weird. I'm pretty sure the wipes are just fine.I do wish that it came with a pop-up adapter or something. I like the Pamper's pop-up wipes but find it difficult to pull one out because they are inner-folded and stick together. It works better with the Huggies wipes.The only other issue is that the lid collects condensed water and I am afraid of it leaving a puddle on our furniture. So, I place it on a folded face towel and that seems to work.Overall despite the few minor issues mentioned I am very pleased with this product.
-1	Like most other parents, I was happy at finding a warmer at a reasonable price, and this worked well for the first year but then it quit.The organizer caddy was handy.  It attaches to the side of your diaper table or crib with brackets that are included.  Also included are some rubber "things" that help you adjust the brackets for a smaller widths; for instance, if you are attaching to a table instead of a crib.  The front of the caddy is a zip-up net and inside you can fit about 15-20 diapers.  There are two pockets on each side that I use to keep small bottles of lotion, diaper cream, etc.  The warmer snaps onto the caddy so that it won't fall off the top easily.It also has a tendency to "cook" the bottom wipes and turn them dark yellow to brown.  It seems this is a problem with most warmers that warm from the bottom.The wipes have a tendency to dry out, but I think that is the case with most warmers.  I usually just add a bit of water every now and them to keep them from doing so (although this particular brand recommends against it, but my current one recommends TO DO it).I was disappointed to find out that there was no warranty when it quit working. I spent the same amount of money on one at Wal-Mart and it has a 5 year warranty - long enough to at least get me through the diaper stage!Specifics:  It is plug-in and not battery operated.  I think most units this size are plug-in.  It fits all size wipes, but does not have the feature for pop up wipes.  And it holds an entire refill size of wipes.  It warms from the bottom, not the top.  It is very easy to open and there is no lock for the lid.  You cannot adjust the temperature.  I think that is the same for most though.
+1	The good thing about this product is that it was cheap and it gets the job done.  My little one cries now when we are away from home and have to use cold wipes!  She really likes the warm ones.For awhile the doctor wanted us to use wash clothes wet with only water(they recommend this for newborns anyway).  I almost died thinking about walking to the bathroom to wet a washcloth with a screaming baby for Every diaper change, but this product provided a simple solution...  I wet the washcloths and stored them in the warmer.  Then wiped her with warm cloths that were conviently located.  We are using wipes in it now.There are a few things I don't like.  There plastic things that are supposed to make it fit better on the side of the changing table.  They fall off and behind the changing table a lot which is annoying.  It doesn't fit great even with the "sizers"  I also don't think that the diaper stacker is useful at all I tied a ribbon around ours so that is wouldn't hang down anymore.Also, the warmer dries out the bottom wipes and turns them yellowish, brown.  I have "solved" this by leaving the same wipes on the bottom all the time.This is a good product for the money, if you don't mind taking the bad with the good!
-1	We bought this wipes warmer for our son's room and it was awful.  The wipes were always hard and brown at the bottom.  We wasted more money throwing ruined wipes away.  We returned it and bought the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer.  We've had that one for 8 months now and never had a problem with burnt wipes.  I should have paid the money and bought that one in the first place.  Don't waste your money or time buying this wipes warmer- it is cheap and you will regret it.
+1	My son really enjoys his jitter buggy, it has cute indicator lights and sounds, he loves the vibration, he's 6 months and has sat happily in it up to an hour while I was cleaning. Once he gets bored with one side, I turn the seat so he's facing the other direction. I got it on sale at a great price so definitely worth the price.It is a bit bulky, luckily our apartment has an open layout so it tucks away against a wall, but it is not portable and you can't really store it. I do move it room to room without any problem, even when he is in it, I just push it into the kitchen or family room and nothing falls apart (as another reviewer wrote)
+1	I had this in an older version (didn't have the radio feature) for my 2 sons. Well, I thought I was done with it and sold it. Now I am expecting a 3rd boy...back to my Buggy! I had to have this again. But even better, is the new features it has...a radio, cell phone, cupholder, and traffic signal. Love this buggy. It kept my 2 older boys busy for hours. I expect and HOPE it does the same for my new son. I love that it bounces, rocks, and spins. I think it is cuter than the traditional saucers and is more entertaining. I dont care for the traditional walker either ( I also have carpet so, they don't really work anyway). I got one as a gift and it was smaller than the Jitter Bug and I had a hard time getting my son in and out of it. OK, so this doesnt fold compact like the new saucers advertise to do, but I don't mind b/c I happen to like this type of entertainer much better, so that may be the one and only downside. This is not just for a boy b/c it is a car...girls like cars too! Highly recommended A+
+1	We are on our third batch of these sippy cups for our twin daughters. They are simply to use, come in wonderful, vibrant colors, and are surprisingly hard to generate messes with (a bonus with two children).The cups themselves are sturdy and durable. They survive whatever abuse is dealt to them. We have not yet had any problems with cracking or breakage of the lid, the part that understandably takes the most stress. We use them every day, and replace them fairly frequently (when the start to look dingy and 'old'), and have thus far been quite happy with these cups.However! I wish that they were not so hard to get clean. We hand wash all plastics that our daughters use, so if you use the dishwasher for cleaning these your experience is likely to differ. The problem I have is that food/dry liquid gets stuck in a small groove on the inside of the spout. It is very hard, even with considerable soaking, to get the crusty bits out of that space. We toss the cups as soon as this becomes noticeable, but a slight design change to eliminate the space would be welcome to those of us who are hand washing.These cups certainly fulfill their mission and I am very happy we have them, I just wish we could get a little more mileage out of them before tossing (since every little bit helps - replacing frequently is somewhat expensive!).
+1	I have some of these cups that I have been using for my son, and while generally they are great, they do no t travel very well.  I end up taping over the mouthpiece and putting the cup in a ziploc plastic bag to prevent milk from getting everywhere.I was so excited to see these with travel caps.  Imagine my disappointment when I realized my SEVEN new cups came with ONE cap.
+1	I have been looking for inexpensive sippy cups that are BPA free to send to daycare with my daughter, now that we are transitioning from bottles of breastmilk to other milk.  The main problem that I was having is that many of the sippy cups that I loved did not have a travel lid.  These sippy cups are perfect.  They are inexpensive enough so I don't care if they end up lost.  As for traveling, they do come with one travel cap which is nice, but instead, I also purchased theThe First Years 6 Pack Take & Toss Snack Cups, 4.5 Ounce, Colors May Varywhich have lids that fit perfectly on the sippy cups.Most importantly, my baby drinks out of these with no problems!
+1	Without reservation this is the best cup out there!  Our 15 month loves it, its easy to use and we take a couple with us everywhere.  The lack of handles is a benefit and the slow drip design keep spills to a minimum.  Easy to clean, and easy for baby to use - these are perfect.
+1	I don'[t want to offend anyone, but I had to laugh at the reviews criticizing this product for only working well the first time.  Do we not understand the meaning of 'TAKE N TOSS'?  They're meant to use one time, and then toss.  They go everywhere with my Daughter and I.  I love they're disposable so I don't have to lug around a dirty sippy all day.  They're cheap enough I bought sets to get through the summer.  I'd highly recommend these.
+1	Does a great job of not spilling and keep a good flow of milk/water into our toddler's mouth. We've had other cups that he would take too much at once and end up overflowing out of his mouth but these work great. It only spills when it is really full and left horinzontal, and a little bit comes out of the regular opening. Great price.
+1	Cute, cheap and they work! The only thing my baby would drink from (no bottles, no other sippy cups). Can go through dishwasher and be used again and again - very durable. But if you lose one its ok because they are super cheap to replace.
+1	First off, this is not a cup for a parent with a child that throws cups or pulls lids off or flips cups upside down and shakes them on a regular basis.  If you want one of those then you need to get a cup with a valve that's closer to a bottle.  However if you need a cup that won't make a huge mess when knocked over then these are the right cups for you.These are nice cups for kids transitioning to regular cups or for older kids that are in situations where a regular cup would be inconvenient.  I used these for years after my daughter had transitioned to a regular cup when we were in situations where a spilled drink would have been a disaster, such as for her cup beside her bed at night, the cup I put her juice in when she was sick and for trips in the car.  They're cheap and they stack in the back of your cabinet so you can just pull them out when you need them.The cups are dishwasher safe, they do crack when chewed on but besides that they're fairly strong for something that is disposable.
-1	My son is only 10 months old and can't use this seat because there's not enough space between the seat and the tray.  He's not a fat child, either, only in the 50th % and it cuts right into his belly.  I'll be returning it today.
-1	We bought this without really taking time to research it because we were in a rush over the summer and needed a booster to use at a relatives house who doesn't have one.  I wish I read the reviews first, because I would have bought the "on the go" booster instead.  Oh well, that's the beauty of heindsight I guess.  :-PThis seat serves it's purpose.PROS:Hard plastic seat and tray is easy to cleanStraps, once assembled and fastened, stay tightTray is removableFolds up for storageGood for light use, I wouldn't use it everyday- read the cons and you'll understandCONS:Tray is HARD to remove, you have to grasp and pull the sides JUST SO to get it to pop off (I have to struggle to stiffle an array of 4-letter words quite often when trying to take the tray off)It's cumbersum to set up and fold down and you'll need both hands to do both (we use the "on-the-go" booster at my mother-in-law's and I can open it with one hand, plop my daughter in the seat, strap her in, and strap the booster seat to the chair easily).  First you need to untangle the straps, make sure they're going in and coming out of all the right places, THEN you can put your toddler in first and attach the booster to the seat next or vice versa.  The removable tray is nice, but again, a struggle to take off more often than not.  To fold it back down, you'll need both hands once again to push buttons on either side of the seat to pop up the seat and fold it in, then put the tray in with the rest of it, and spend another minute or two "organizing" the straps so they don't get tangled up with each other or come apart from the seat itself (even after the straps are "assembled" going in and out of all the right places, they just fall back out if you're not really careful).This seat isn't bad for us, we only use it at relatives houses who don't have a booster seat, so it's not too much of a hassle.  (It's only been used a half a dozen times in the past year)  But I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to use it more than once a month.  The removable tray is nice, and it is easy to clean, but between the hassle of removing the tray, having to use 2 hands to set it up and fold it back down, and the straps that fall out way too easily when not fastened, it's too much hassle for everyday use.  If you need a booster to use more often, I'd recommend the "on-the-go" booster seat.
+1	i love this seat!  i wish that it had a reclining mode, but i think that theres no way it would travel in such a handy little package if it did that!  i love how the straps wind up, the seat completely folds up, and the lid snaps on!  how cool is that!  it travels so nicely!  i definitely recommend this product!
+1	When I was expecting my 3rd child, my children were about 18 months, and 4 years old... and I needed to pass down my toddlers highchair to the baby...This saftey first seat is excellent!Features...*  The straps that attatch the booster to the chair can roll up underneath the booster seat.*  A handle to carry the chair by once folded*  A place to hook the tray on when the seat is folded*  Optional legs for different hights*  A VERY small compartment, we usually just keep a bibster in there (VERY hard to fit it though!)*  A lap belt that keeps my son in the chair.*  A removable tray, just one (nothing to loose!). It doesnt adjust, but if your baby no longer fits with the tray, they are probably old enough to use the booster underneath the table (like my now 2 year old).I really do not have any complaints, the chair is very sturdy, can fit on nearly every chair we use, and is great for travel, but now my son really doesnt want to sit in the "baby" seats at the restaurants, but I do not like the boosters without straps for the chair that they provide... so this may start getting out more often!
+1	This product was very easy to use and required very little effort.  The instructions are clear and are helpful (I noticed a review that a woman rolled the dough too thin, but the directions clearly say not to.  Maybe they have altered the directions to help alleviate any problems since she purchased hers).  I too had enough left over to make a handprint which I was happy about :)  I am so glad to have this keepsake of my baby's adorable little foot.
+1	My husband bought this.  He loved the idea of putting the baby's picture next to her foot and hand print.  He thought that it would be really neat for her to look back at the picture of her at 6 weeks and see how small she was and how tiny her little feet and hands were.  It was so easy to to do.  The material is really easy to work with.  It is so easy to get baby's foot and hand in it.  It isn't goopy so you can bring the material to the baby instead of trying to do the balancing act of getting the baby positioned over the material and then trying to hold her still while you put her into the stuff.  This package you just grabbed the appendage you wanted to imprint, put the material to the foot/hand and pressed gently in.  The frame was easy to put together after the caste was all dry.  The set has the background pink on one side and blue on the other.  It really doesn't get any easier and it is really attractive once put together.  The only problem I did have was that my caste cracked when drying.  Not very much, but just enough to be noticeable.  (This was because my husband didn't lay it exactly flat to dry, this was not any fault of the product)  However, I just filled the crack with caulk.  It worked great.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a special keepsake for their child and anyone buying a gift for an expectant parent.
+1	Great gift! It was easy to follow the direction. The molding material is easy to work at. It doesn't dry too quickly so there're plenty of time to try over and over
-1	I think the material for the mold especially and for the entire frame is somewhat cheap.  I know a couple of people who've been happy with this product but it just didn't work for us.  It is tough to do with a squirmy baby and once we did finally get a mold the contrast wasn't very striking--a footprint with ink may look better.  Not worth the effort or $, in my opinion.
+1	I have checked out many of the baby foot print frames and this one is by far the best quality and the easiest to use. The plaster is quick to set, easy to do and looks good in the finished product. The frame is high qulity and has great clean lines. This is a great product that has been hard to find in the stores. I have two! Love them! (I have even knocked one off the wall on accident and it didn't break - they are good quality, not cheap!)
+1	I gave the Eddie Bauer backpack diaper bag five stars because it is simply wonderful! I had been spotting this bag in the store for sometime and broke down and bought it. I am so glad I did. It is so good for those short trips to the grocery store, visiting friends & family , shopping at the mall. I can easily pack two bottles in a small cooler type bag , plenty of diapers (I take 6 diapers) and a compact container of wipes, I also put several outfits in the zipper part (You never know when your little one is going to mess up his clothes)and my son's bib. I have lotion and baby oil in the side pockets and everything just fits perfectly in the bag. I can also put my keys and wallet in the zipper section also and I still have plenty of room. This diaper bag is however not for a long trip, it is perfect for those short trips. I love the backpack style and how compact it is and it works great. I hated taking my bigger diaper out with us when we were only going to be gone for a couple of hours because it was so bulky and I didn't need that much stuff anyway. I think the price is very reasonable and well worth. Trust me you will use it all the time and wonder why you have those other diaper bags. I would rather use this diaper bag than the other two I have. I would highly reccommend this backpack style diaper bag to everyone! My son is 2 1/2 months old and I can carry everything he needs in this bag. Try this diaper backpack one time and you will be hooked like me!!!!
-1	It is a great looking backpack and works if you only need to go somewhere for a short period of time. It doesn't hold very much and the top doesn't close like you think it should.
+1	I had purchased the soothing dreams monitor ... and the sound quality was so bad I took it back.  This monitor doesn't have all the neat features that the soothing dreams did, but it does something the other didn't - it WORKS!  The sound quality is wonderful.  You can hear the faintest noise in the baby's room, or keep the volume down and just see the lights.  This monitor is really the best as far as sound quality goes, and the low price is definitely a bonus!  Don't waste your money on a monitor with more frills that doesn't work as well - this is all you need!!!
+1	This monitor is wonderful.  We get clear reception all of the time.  There is no annoying static or humming like many other monitors.  Best of all it is one of the most affordable monitors on the market.  Talk about getting a lot of bang for your buck.  The monitor has noise indicator lights, so when you can't hear the monitor (ie volume turned down, or you're vaccuming) you can see if baby is fussing.
-1	This monitor worked great for the first week. Then, there was so much static I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't hear the baby clearly. I highly recommend the Sony babycall monitor (also carried by Babies R Us, but not online). It has a wonderful voice activated only feature that allows perfect silence from the monitor unless baby is fussing (i.e., you won't hear the vacuum cleaner or the dryer or the neighbor's dog barking, etc. - it only turns on when the baby cries or your spouse talks, etc.) I bought the Sony and retired the Fisher Price and am sleeping better than I have in weeks.
+1	I purchased a different monitor and ..., ended up exchanging and puchasing this monitor.  The clairty is so good and it's as if my baby is in the same room.  The price is also unbeatable.  I highly recommend this monitor.
+1	We got this as one of our shower gift. It is very nice and has everything you need. I like the hard case because it is durable. I really like the the finger nail clippers the best. We use the brush and comb a lot also. I think it is reasonably price and has everything you need.
-1	The nail clippers,hairbrush, and comb are great but I did not care for the rest. It would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company.
+1	I have to agree with many of the reviews here...these outlet plugs manage to keep babies and adults from accessing outlets pretty effectively, but that was why I bought them.  It seems there are two types of outlet plugs available at this point: those that babies can figure out in very little time (and are easy for parents to remove too) and those that keep babies out (yet give parents trouble as well.)I have lupus and even in the middle of a flare, when my hands are very weak and stiff, I can still get these plugs out even though it requires a good deal of effort.  They do give me confidence though that my baby is safe--now he's only 8 months, but is very active and I'm sure would figure out other plugs in no time.  So far, he has seen these, touched them, and lost interest pretty quickly.  I do have to say, though, that I have access to some outlets placed higher on the wall that I use for vacuuming, kitchen appliances, etc. and have tried to minimize the need to take these plugs in and out of high-use outlets.
+1	I switched from the basic plastic covers to these when my son learned how to pull those out easily.These require two hands and some wiggling back and forth to get out:  they don't pull straight out.There's no way my son (or any kid!) is going to get these out, and that's their purpose... To keep him safe.  I'm willing to spend the extra 10 seconds and a little minor effort to pull them out to keep it that way.
-1	They work alright, NO ONE will use your outlet, not even you. They are impodsible to remove. I had to use a pointed tool with one hand while squeezing three buttons simultaneously with the other hand. Sounds easy huh? Don't buy.
+1	These things are bomb (and almost adult) proof!  And, they're the only ones I've found that work on the plugs with the rectangular openings in the face plate.
+1	The basic covers did not cut it. They are tough to remove, but that is the point. We feel much safer.
+1	Yes, these things work. NO baby can get them off.  Thing is, if your outlets aren't 100% sturdy (i.e.. loose sockets), you adults will have a tough time too (because of how tightly they stick).  Your best bet is to alternate: use these in your baby's primary play area and choose a more user-friendly model for the places you plug in most. (The simple ones without the release buttons.)  This works for us.
+1	Unobtrusive, and my toddler hasn't figured them out yet -- can't argue with that.  They are a bit tricky to get in and out, and they require enough force that if your outlets aren't solidly mounted, they'll move about too.  They do the job, but I much prefer theSafe Plate for Electric Outlet - Bulk 25 Pack - White with Single Screw.  I used these where the Safe Plates wouldn't fit (double gangs, for instance).
-1	We tried these when my todder started to be able to pull out simpler socket protectors. First, they wouldn't go into all the sockets. Sometimes they'd work on one socket in a pair, but not the other, so I don't htink that was user error or some problem with the fixture. Second, my 2 year old was able to figure out the mechanism and strong enough to pull them out within 20 minutes.
+1	These are some heavy-duty plug covers, which is a good thing. I have twin boys who see everything as an interesting challenge, yet they can't get these covers out of the outlet. Sure, they take a couple moments for us adults to remove, but the benefit outweighs any silly impatience one might feel while wiggling the cover out. These are so much better than the old style plug covers, which my daughter used to just pluck right out of the outlet and put in her mouth.
+1	PRO:  I feel confident that my child will not be able to remove theseCON: We have a hard time removing these when we need to use the outlets. It definitely takes two hands to push the top button and squeeze the sides at the same time.
-1	These plugs are actually really difficult to open so I end up pulling them out of the outlet sockets anyways.
+1	I love these outlet plugs. We had the cheaper ones by the same company that you don't press to put in the outlet and my 18 month old daughter was able to pull them right out. So we decided to try these. Let me tell you... these things are HARD to get out of the wall, even for me. But that's a GOOD thing in my opinion. I would rather have something that is so difficult to get out that I even have to take a few moments to do it than something my daughter is going to just pull out and possibly end up hurting herself.PROs:+Hard to pull from the wall+Easy to install+Works on any standard outletCONs:-Hard to pull from the wall even as an adult-A bit pricey if you need to do a lot of outlets
+1	I purchased these after reading the reviews on how hard they are to remove so I was not too surprised by how hard they are to remove - lol. You just need to figure out how to take them out and find a gadget that can help depress the safety - a screw driver works well for us. We bought two types, put these in the areas our son has a lot of access, and on outlets we dont use much. We used a cheaper, easier to remove style on the other outlets.
+1	These are not easy to remove....actually, they are a nuisance if you decide you want to use the outlet.  However, they need to be because it doesn't take much for a curious or dexterous child to figure out how to remove other styles of plugs.  I have three kinds in the house, and these are by far my favorite.  There is no way he is going to be able to remove these!
-1	You have to push in on both sides of these to remove them, every single one in the pack had one side already jammed in and wouldn't move.Pushing the sides in doesn't move the latch enough for the cover to come out, you then need to wrestle with it to get it out which is not good for your back when you are already leaning down to do this.They are a good idea but very badly made.
+1	These are hard to use - to get on and off, even for adults, which is what we were looking for.  We'll see when our little girl gets interested in outlets...
-1	I bought these based on the great reviews and put them in the outet.  Well, the problem was that I couldn't remove them!  I followed the directions and no luck.  My husband had to mess with them for 10 minutes and pry them out.  I guess they are good at keeping your child out of the outet, but not practical if you ever plan on using the outlet.  I sent these back!
+1	My daughter has the kind that just plug in and you have to pry your fingernail down between the plug and the fixture to get the darned thing off.  I have soft fingernails so it's really hard for me to do that when I want to use and outlet at her house.  I got these for my house and they are much easier to use.  All you do is squeeze the sides and push the top button and they pull right out.  It's great because they stick out a little from the wall so you can get a much better grip on them and don't have to use your fingernails to pry them off.  However, it would be a challenge for a baby to get them off because he probably couldn't squeeze the sides and push the button at the same time. I'm happy with the purchase.  I am a 57 year old grandma and if I can do it anyone can.
+1	Some of the negative reviews turned me off to the product but I decided to buy them anyways because I couldn't find a sliding plate cover for my GFCI outlets and I didn't want our child to see us removing the easier outlet safety plugs on a regular basis.I think this product must have been improved some because the ones I bought can only be pushed in on one side and they work exactly as per the instructions. Basically, pushing the left button unlocks the top button and pushing on the top button unlocks the latch from the ground hole. With the top button continually depressed, you need to patiently rock the plug up and down until it comes out. It's particularly frustrating if you're in a rush or otherwise tired because on the first pull or two there is very little noticeable progress. Personally I feel that the tight fit is a sign of a good design and most certain to frustrate even those toddlers with good coordination.After a few weeks of regular use, my husband can now remove them with one hand in a single pull.  The best part is it looks like he's just tugging on the plug so our little one is unlikely to catch onto the required button sequence.Too bad they cost so much (relative to the plain plugs) or I'd consider using them everywhere since they are fairly low profile and thus inconspicuous.The size and grip of the product might make it difficult for people with large hands or who lack coordination/strength in their fingers/hands.
-1	After reading the reviews I was hoping these would keep my little one safe. However, even after I followed the directions, the plugs would just fall right out of the outlet/socket...with out any prompting at all.I had to return these...thankfully Amazon is GREAT about their return policy.
+1	I don't think every hospital gives away these things.  The hospital where I delivered only gave me a nasal aspirator in terms of these tools to take home.  So these gadgets did and still do help me, especially the nail clippers, files, and hair brush.  I disagree that baby's nails are that soft that you can peel off - that would mean that you would have to wait until it gets too long before you can peel it off - I don't want to risk my baby scratching himself with the long nails or getting a hang nail or so long that it actually near the nail off itself where it might tear too deep and bleed.  I do agree that the nail clipper could be a little smaller but it still works.  Great products!
-1	First of all the bulb syringe it's TOO HARD, and worst: it did not suck at all (the blue one from the hospital have been a life saver).  The brush is too rough for a baby under 2, and the comb I started to use it when my daughter was 3 months old, because is too rough for a newborn.  The nail clipper is too big for my daughter little The comb it's OK... The nail fillers are way TOO ROUGH too.  The dropper is TOO BIG....I REGRET of spending my money in this.....Keep searching for another set!!!!UPDATE---> I'm writing this note because after reading my comment after a year I have to say that I wrote this review stating that the items doesn't work for a newborn as they promise, but most of the items you can use them for an older baby... I have to say that the nail clipper has been the best one ever since my daughter was 15 months old, and after my husband step on it an broke it I run to the store and bought another one: Lucky me that I found it in a smaller set just with the scisors and the nail fillers and I didn't had to buy the whole kit again!!
+1	this package has every thing i was looking fore and in a great price ...it's perfect for all new moms
+1	This Nursery and Bath Care Set contains a number of highly useful baby items stored in a case that's compact and sturdy enough for regular travel.  Our son recently turned two and we still have the kit on-hand for almost daily use.The best items include*  the well-designed medicine spoon:  It stands upright on its own so you can pour liquids into it and see how much you've dispensed;  the guidelines are metric on one side and English on the other;  the spoon itself is sized well for baby with little to no mess* the nail clippers:  Big handle for sure gripping while holding a potentially squirmy customer* the bath thermometer:  Much more accurate than so many other bath toys that try to do double duty as a thermometer).The most disappointing component was predictably the thermometer.  It's a pretty simplistic digital model that needed to be held in place too long to get very accurate readings from a baby.  My wife and I use it ourselves and it works fine.  If your baby tends to get a lot of fevers, invest in a high-end ear or forehead thermometer for the best combination of accuracy and speed.  The toothbrush is also not very helpful because by the time baby is ready to begin brushing, he or she will want a less clinical-looking model with a smaller, softer head than this one has.One note on the negative review at the top of the page:  maybe everyone should move to Ann Arbor, MI before delivering because the hospitals and pharmacies are much more liberal with their giveaways there.  We loved our hospital experience, but our parting gifts consisted of a bulb aspirator (which wasn't as nice as the one in this kit), a pat on the back and a "have a nice day now".  Leaving the hospital and coming home with a newborn, especially your first, can be an unbelievably hectic time - I wouldn't want to rely on the possibility of freebies to help us take care of our baby.Given the low cost of this kit, it's well worth knowing that you're prepared to come home with your newborn.  And the Nursery and Bath Care Set will continue to pay off with its travel convenience and useful contents for years to come.
+1	Contrary to what another reviewer said I did not get any of these things or any baby care items when I left the hospital with my baby. So this came in handy. The only items I really use are the nail clippers, thermometer and baby brush. Because the nail clippers are so big in my hand I don't drop them as easily as I would regular small ones if my baby hits my hand. They are nice and sharp also. I haven't found a need for the way the top is able to swival though. Everything is pretty standard and not very low quality as I had feared. The brush is like a typical baby or doll brush (very soft and fine) and doesn't help getting the cradle cap scales off very well. The tub thermometer is ok, but is rather hard to read underwater. The carrying case is clear and zippered which I found very handy since I could see at a glance what was in it and what was missing. I think I would have prefered to just buy the items individually for more money, but if you don't have much to spend this would be good.
+1	i didnt know they had a pink option but the blue still looks nice for my baby girl.  It has the basics that make a first time mom-to-be feel a little better about bringing her baby home from the hospital.  I love the brush, very soft and the fact that it all fits in that case is nice to have organized.  hope i can keep it like that!
-1	I got this for my baby shower and was very disappointed when I opened it. I know the clippers and thermometer are necessities, so was excited to see that this kit came with both of us. However, when I opened it I realized that the clippers and thermometer are both cheaply made, therefore I will have to purchase them both separately. Everything else is just "fluff" that you don't really need. Most of it you will get from the hospital and a syringe comes with all medicines you will buy. Save your money...buy clippers and thermometer separately and don't worry about the rest...you don't need it or you'll get it from the hospital.
+1	I haven't used it yet, but it seems really complete and full of everything we will need and I liked it better than others I saw.
-1	This has some useful things in it but not enough to merit the purchase.  Get a nosefreida instead of the bulb thing, get baby nail scissors instead of the clippers, the teething tablets have been recalled and I can't get the medicine-dispensing pacifier open to put the medicine in.  Also the syringe tip is too large to fit in the opening of the pain reliever so doling it out is a pain on its own and the markings rub off the syringe making it useless after a few uses.  I don't use the teething toy.  I think the only thing in here that I actually use is the thermometer.  In the end, it's just easier to purchase the things you need separately.  This doesn't have anything magical in it that you would overlook...when baby has a snotty nose, you have to clean it; when baby has a fever/pain, you have to relieve it, etc.
+1	After having this product for 8 months of my daughter's life I'd say I have used and still use every product except the medicine syringe, as it didn't contain enough suction to hold any medicine. The case is too bulky really for a diaper bag, I have never needed all these products on the go, but it does get a lot of use by the changing station. I'm pleased with the kit overall and would say 11 out of the 12 products being of use I'd rate it 5 stars nevertheless.
+1	I love this kit.  Everything in this kit is a necessity and works well.  My only complaint is the nail clippers.  They are a bit big to use on a newborn...Oh, and I wish I knew what hospital the lady went to that received all of these products...I got diapers and a formula bag...I had to sneak the t-shirt and blanket for memories!!
+1	... the rest of the items were!  I just can't seem to get enough suction out of the aspirator for it to work.It has everything you need, and the carrying case isn't bulky.  It really is a good investment!
-1	The thing I use most in this kit is the hair brush.  The nail files are okay.  The medicine dropper was useless.  It wouldn't suction up any medicine. The fingernail clipper is also useless.  It's just an adult-sized one with an attachment.  Should have gotten a baby-specific and -sized one even though right now I'm just trying to file their nails rather than clip then (on their pediatrician's advice).  I'm using the nasal aspirators that we took from the hospital, which I'm told are the best.  So, in all, if I were to do it again, I'd just buy the pieces one-by-one rather than in this kit since I haven't used much of it, and the parts that I have used, have mostly unimpressed me.
+1	Not all kits include scissor, digital thermometer, tweezer etc. This is one does. The compact pouch securely holds everything in place which is great for traveling. Great value!
+1	It's been awhile since the last review so I thought I'd share my opinion. While some hospitals may (did) give you some of the items in the kit, it's not a guarantee that they will and there's nothing wrong with  having a backup. I actually have 2 of these kits, one for the house and one for the diaper bag.
-1	I don't think we will be able to use any of these items. They al feel cheap.  The bulb syringe does not even work.
+1	Extend the life of your Avent's product.  They fit with all my Avent cups and bottles. Also, they help to my daughter to lear to drink independently.
-1	They are a great product if your child takes to the trainer set, other wise, inquisitive children get distracted by them, specially because of the color choices instead of making them clear or white.
+1	These are great.  I would rather spend a small amount of money on buying these to put on my Avent bottles than a lot more on sippy cups.  They just fit to your regular Avent bottles easily.  They can go in the dishwasher too, and my son is just starting to hold his own bottle and he loves it.  He can't grasp the entire bottle so these are ideal.  What a great idea combined with the no spill teats he is catered for until he go to a sports bottle and cup.  Love them.
+1	So, Let me start my review by saying not being able to pick the color is annoying (I have a bruiser of a boy & received 2 pink handles), but at least the colors offered match the Avent label on the bottles, so it's not that big of a deal.  My boy finds these handles really easy to use.  We owned 2 Avent bottles (our only bottles because he exclusively breastfeeds) & when his doctor encouraged starting him on sippy cups with a little bit of water (6months), I really didn't want the bottles to go to waste.  I am thrilled that Avent offers these handles (& their Non Spill Soft Spouts).  The handles are perfect for little hands & giving the consumer the option to modify what they already own is ingenious.
+1	I really like these. I have been using these to convert my daughter's Avent 4 oz bottles to sippy cups. Perfect inexpensive accessory to save on the price of sippys. She is 11 months and has been using them since she was 6 months. I would have given them a 5 star rating if I could pick the colors. I got two green ones, which is fine, just wish I had a choice!
+1	i personally love all the avent items! my son is just now learning to hold his own bottle and this is helping him so much!
+1	I know the thing has the dimensions, and of course it's going to be small if it holds a 2X3 frame. Even though I see dimensions I can't see that in my head before it arrives, this thing is so itty bitty. Maybe great for a cramped desk space, other than that it is REALLY nice, and super cute!
+1	I move a lot so making sure my frames are durable is paramount. This frame is very well made and didn't sustain any damage when a dog nose knocked it onto the tile from a table top.
+1	frame is cute.  it has real weight to it, so it doesn't feel or look cheap at all.  Note that it can only be used for verticle pictures because the images on the sides are set to be vericle.
+1	When I say that Its from experience. I have two twins, 8 mnt B.B and 3 year old B/G. My older twins had a regular Diaper Genie, let me tell you that thing was the worst!! When I heard they had a "new and imporved" diaper genie, I decided to give it a shot. Wow I HATED that one two, who woulda guessed? I dont know anyone who would enjoy turning a knob fifty times to get a new bag, one handed, are you kidding me? Okay so that one was history. There were 2 others I was looking at, the Diaper Champ, and the Neat Diaper Disposal System, yes this one wasnt in mind just yet. My friend has ONE 10 month old and her Champ STINKS. But since she really doesnt know any others I told her that if the other pails sucked too, than I would just get that one. Well now the neat, we didnt buy it, we saw it at a friends house who HATED her Champ, well now she HATES the neat. she has a 3 month old and an 18 month old. So I didnt know what to do. I was leaning toward the champ because if all of them stunk, atleast this one didnt need refils. Well at BRU there was a disposal system I didnt see before, low and behold.... THE DEKOR PLUS! I told my husband that all of the other ones stunk, so lets just try this one, we could say we tried them all! Well, for the occasional 3 year old pull ups, and 2x the dirty 8 month old diapers... I LOVE IT! This thing is just so nifty. It really keeps the smell at bay, until of course when you empty it. I keep one of those circular deoderant things attatched (sometimes 2!) and I spray it with lysol when I CLEAN it out, every 2 weeks or so. And When I empty it the smell is no worse than a regular dirty diaper smell. Well I do sometimes get a little whift of it in the boys room, but than I JUST CHANGE THE BAG! Duhh, if it starts to smell just change it more often. I am sorry but diapers STINK and I found that the Diaper Dekor is the best. My friends have K.O the champ and wished away of their diaper genies. Hey if you think you should get the champ because you dont need to buy so many refils, well guess what, That just means a stinky nursery and ALOT more garbage bags. These refils last MONTHS. I love it soo much that I think I may just get one for downstairs too!Dont waste your money on the others, save a little more and get this one, its the ONLY one that WORKS**** WOW. I just read a review on targets website on the diaper genie. They said that they just dispose of the #2 waste in a diaper down the toilet, not the whole diaper or the wipe, just the "#2". It eliminates almost all odors and I will definatly be trying it. (And for those #2 diapers that you really just cant do that with, just do as you do with the wet diapers, and it wont be that unbearable.) A GREAT IDEA!!
-1	I bought this product because of the reviews I read about it.  However it DOES NOT keep out the smell of dirty diapers.  I have used it for 7 months now and had to go buy a different one. If you are like me, you want the products you buy to do the intended job.  This is not what you want.  Get the Diaper Champ or use a regular trash can and put it out of the way (extra bathroom, laundry room, etc.)
+1	I bought this for my child's nursery. He is now 3 months old and we are on our second bag (we just used up the one that came with the diaper pail at 2 months). So far, no odors. The bags do have a light scent which may help odor control. I love that I do not feel like I am wasting bags. I can cut the bags and make a new one when its full or if his diapers get too smelly when we introduce solid food, I will cut the bags and take them out sooner. I usually take out 1 bag a week (full!). They fit a lot of diapers inside. I recently purchased a second diaper dekor plus for the downstairs as our regular trash can was starting to smell a bit. I absolutely love this diaper pail and recommend it!!
+1	The Diaper Dekor is excellent and does the job well.  My newborn's diapers easily drop into the Dekor with just a step of the pedal.  Once the Dekor is full, the bag is easily removed and cut to just the right length which means no bag is wasted.  The bag has a nice scent which isn't overpowering.  The bags have proven to be durable and strong to support the weight of the diapers.  My nursery has been smell free from diaper odor because of the Dekor Plus Diaper System.  My only complaint would be that I wish it was bigger (it's smaller than a standard trash can).
+1	I have been using my diaper pail by Dekor for 8 months now and I love it. I have tried out a few of the others via my girlfriends, and none seem to be as easy to use and works as well.The foot pedal design to open the lid sold me. (you're hands are busy enough!) Although it can be heavier to lift due to the sealing around the edge of the lid, it gets the job done better then anything having to use my hands, and I never have a problem getting my dirty diaper in the pail due to this. The seal is worth it!The diapers drop through another door that automatically opens when you drop the diaper on it, and closes back up after by it's self.The liner bags are well designed in that you tie off the bag at the bottom, and simply fill with diapers as you would a regular trash bag (no crazy long diaper sausage!) The bottom opens up when you're ready to change the bag. It has a small "razor edge" (very well protected from any injury) on the inside of the door that you slice the bag off however full it is. Tie it off again at the bottom, and you're all set! (Sounds harder and more complicated then it really is.)I did hesitated at the thought of having to buy replacement bags. I bought two boxes before my daughter was born, and she is now 8 months old, and I STILL have not had to buy any more boxes yet! Not as costly as I had thought....especailly for the convienence of it all!!Smell. Well, it really does do a good job with smells. As we all know, as baby's diet changes, so does the smell of her diapers!  I'd say, I didn't smell a THING until 6-7 months old with the introduction of solids. Of course, I wouldn't want to think about how it'd be now without the Dekor! I did my research before buying a diaper pail, and in a comparision test of the top selling diaper pails, this one was the winner....especailly smell factor! Regular cleaning and Lysoling helps keep the pail as fresh as possible.I reccomend this pail to all my friends. Personal experience, reviews and word of mouth are the best way to gather your research in the quest for your perfect baby products!
+1	The Diaper Dekor is the best. The refills last forever, it is totally simple to use and it really does not smell. We dump the diapers about once a week, and there is literally no smell within that time. After using other diaper pails with my older kids, I highly recommend this one.
-1	I bought this product based on the reviews I read about a year ago.  My daughter is now 11 months old and the entire room STINKS whenever we have to dispose of a soiled diaper!  I have to change the bag every time she has a BM. I finally gave up and and bought another Diaper Genie. I had one with my first two children and it may be more of a hassle to use but I do not recall it omitting as much odor as the Diaper Dekor Plus.  Save your money, don't buy this product!
+1	I was happy to find a diaper disposal system that worked well with cloth diapers.  It usually fills up just as I am ready to do diaper laundry, so it has a great capacity.  We used the disposable liners that came with it until I ran out, and then used the re-usable cloth liners that I purchased separately.  Both were very easy to use, and helped to keep our nursery stink-free.  If you go back and forth with cloth and disposable, or plan to do one and then the other, this is a great option, as you can use it easily for both options, as opposed to the Munchkin or Diaper Genie, which are much harder to use with cloth.
+1	We purchased this when for our nursery. Honestly, I originally wanted this one because it looked nicer than the other pails, and the white and grey went with our nursery. However, now that we've been using it for 6 months, I really love how function it is.Pros:-No smell. I empty this thing maybe once a week (sometimes longer if I'm lazy) and I never smell the dirty diapers. We are into eating solids now, too ... and if you have a baby you know what I'm talking about.-Easy to empty. I love that I can just open the bottom, pull the bag out, cut it off, and the new bag is already loaded and waiting. The bags also hold a lot of diapers. I haven't counted, so I can't tell you exactly how many, but like I mentioned above, I only empty it once a week.-Locking lid. There's a lock on the lid to prevent little hands from getting into the trash. Our baby is only 6 months so I haven't had to worry about this yet, but she's crawling and into everything, so I'm sure it's not far off.-Looks nice. It really does look like a nice diaper pail. Also, the narrow width makes it perfect to fit between our dresser/changing table and the wall.-Refills last forever. The refills are pricier than some others, I'm sure, but they last forever. I've only replaced the bag once and that was around 3-4 months.Cons:-No indicator of when the bag refill is close to the end of the roll. This is really my only complaint. I think I read a review somewhere that suggested putting a pink line or some marker on the refill bags so you know when it's almost out. It hasn't caused me any problems yet, but it would be helpful to know when I'm almost out of bag.-The lid sticks up sometimes, and doesn't close all the way. I'm not sure if this is because it's sitting on plush carpet and not on a hard surface or what, but the lid doesn't always fully shut. Not a big deal because there's a second lid underneath that covers the diapers, but it's an annoyance. I realize I'm being picky here, but I needed at least two cons, right?Overall, this is a really great diaper pail. I've recommended it to all my pregnant friends.
+1	The title says it all, this is absolutely the best diaper diposal system i have tried and i tried a few. The best thing about it other than hardly any smell is the liners that come with last a long time, i did not have to buy refills until i had already used it for 6 months. Holds the smell well enough but nothing is going to cover it up perfectly, adding a bounce dryer sheet helps but the best thing to do is empty it when your trash comes every week.I love the fact that when emptying it you hardly smell anything because you open it from the from and can hurry up and cut and tie the bag before any smell but that comes with a price when your baby becomes older they can learn how to open the top and drop stuff in it but this didnt last that long with my son, he only did a few times.All and all i definately recommend.
+1	My son is now 3 months old, and therefore still in the baby poop phase, and we have not yet had any odor issues with this system. The changing station we use most often is the one that attaches to his pack and play in our bedroom, and so this disposal system is in our bedroom all the time. I have never, even at it's fullest, noticed a smell from it, and my husband has likened me to a bloodhound for my ridiculously sensitive sense of smell. Bear in mind though, that my son is not yet on solids, and his poop is still just glorified bile. I will update this review in a few months when he has really stinky diapers. The only time you will smell it is when you are tying up the bag when it's full, but that's when the whole system is open and you're smelling old poop from a couple of days ago. That has to be expected.It holds a lot, we empty it about twice a week, and the refill cartridges last for AGES! We have used it for 3 months, about 8 or 9 diapers a day (since my son has an INCREDIBLE knack of pooping before, during and after we change him) and we are only about half way through our second cartridge in total. Like other reviewers, I would say they could do with putting a red strip at the end of the refill to let you know you're about to need to put a new one in, but you'd always have your next one ready to go anyway. The door latch isn't very strong, and so the door can open ajar when the bag is quite full and bulging, but again, you'd be changing it by that point anyway, and that would allow the door to close properly again.It's a good price. The refills are not expensive, especially for how long they last. I'd definitely get it again.EDIT: My son is now 7 months old and well and truly on solids with the stinky poop that goes with that. The system is also 7 months old, but all the springs and latches seem as strong as they were to begin with. Sadly, there is a bit of an odor to this system now, and I tend to keep it out in the hallway instead of by the changing station in his room, just so the smell isn't enclosed in one small room all the time. Out there, I honestly don't smell it unless I'm right up close to it, and don't feel the need to hide it when we have guests over.I absolutely stand by my 4 stars. It is a good system, and I would purchase it again. You really need to remember what these systems are for, and that there will always be some degree of smell leakage from any diaper disposal system. My best advice is change the bag every 2-3 days, and clean with Lysol once a week.Still a satisfied customer!
+1	The biggest problem with it is the smell that escapes from the diaper into the bin.  There is simply no way around this.  It might not be too bad while the bin is closed, but once the bag changing time comes, you'll be in for all of foul odor.  One way to mitigate it is to use Munchkin nursery fresheners or any other form of the deodorant/baking soda and place them at the bottom of the bin.  I use two and they help the odors coming from the bag into the container.  I would not use this diaper pail in any room other than a bathroom, where the smell can be captured and gotten rid off through ventilation.PROS:- It is large so no frequent bag cycles are needed- Offers flexibility of frequent or infrequent bag "changes" without wasting the plastic.- Offers a very convenient foot pedal to open the lid- Has an attractive look especially in many offered colors- Does not require for the diaper to be pushed down - if the diaper is soiled enough and is heavy it will fall through by itselfCONS:- Because it is large and the diapers just fall through it is hard to judge how much diapers there are in there.  A lot of diapers in there mean there is a lot of smell, and the bag can be pretty heavy- Mediocre at containing the odors coming from the diapers; especially evident when bag cycle times comes
+1	I love the Diaper Dekor PLUS. Its very convinent and our twins are almost 20 months old and we STILL use it, they are late bloomers and are in the 27% for height and weight. We also use it for our 8 week olds dirty diapers, yuck!PROS-* Nice and big, can hold many diapers* Really is one handed, very cool and easy* No smells, not now and not ever!* Bag refils are inexpensive and last months* Looks very cute with some decales on it lol* My sons have yet to figure out how to open it* We keep a deoderizer in it, keeps it fresh* Very easy to change a bag and thats about the only time you get a whif, and we only change it about every 4 days or so* bags are sold at BRU, Target, and walmart, so they are EASY to find* Holds MANY diapers and pull-ups, my sons will soon be using them* You really only occasionally have to scrub it down with soap and waterCONS-*Refils, it would be PERFECT if it didnt need special refils, but actually that just means, like another reviewer said, ALOT more garbage bags* It would be nice if the refils changed colors near the end, its funny when you realize there are no refils left, and you NEED them lolI would recomend this over any others, all my friends got rid of thier Champs and bought this, its the most expensive for a reason
+1	i can't speak on the ability of this diaper trashcan to contain smells since we are still breastfeeding ... but the design is awesome!  my husband and i love how it is one continuous trashbag and we feel like we don't waste any space since you are essentially making the size of the bag by yourself.  i definitely recommend this trashcan!
+1	This was the first diaper pail I wanted to get but we used cloth diapers for the first 8 months so I needed one that could be used wet or dry. So I bought the diaper champ. While I was using the champ there wasnt too much odor, of course I was washing diapers every other day so there wasnt much chance for odor to build up. However once we stopped using cloth and switched to disposables the smell was awful!There are two problems with the champ, one is it's top heavy so it tips easily and two is it has a hole near the handle so odor is always seeping through.The Diaper Dekor Plus solved both of those issues and more. Its compact yet holds the same ammount of diapers that the "Champ" does. Its the same size on top that it is on bottom so there is no chance of it tipping. There are also no exposed holes to allow odor to escape.On the inside of the door on the bottom is a "cutting tool" that isnt exposed which you use to cut the bag and tie off. SIMPLEUsing the Dekor is easy as well...no handles to twist or turn...you dont even have to use your hands. All you do is step on the peddel and the lid pops up (just like a regular trash can) and you drop in your diaper.I will admit that when Im being lazy and just try to cram "one more" diaper in the dekor that there is a small odor that escapes when Im pushing that diaper in. However it's nowhere near the same STENCH that the "Champ" had.My daughter is now a year and I couldnt be more pleased. If you are using disposables I highly reccomend the Dekor Plus. I have had mine over a month and have yet to change the bag. I was concerned that I would be spending a lot of money on the refills but so far that hasnt been the case.Now my daughters room has no odor except her sweet smell.UPDATE: I have had this for two months now, I change the bag once a week and I still havent had to put in a new refill! I bought the box about a month ago thinking it would be anyday but it still hasnt run out! Also the refills come in boxes of 3 so if one lasts at least two months then your looking at buying refills only twice a year! AWESOME!!!!
+1	This pail is not only good for disposable diapers but cloth diapers as well! It's great that it doesn't require any special type of bag. You can put in a regular trash bag if you want or you can buy their refill bags. I use it with a pail liner for my cloth diapers.It does a great job of keeping the smells in. The only time I notice a smell is when I'm opening it up to throw in a diaper or to change the pail liner.I like this product so much that I recommend it to anyone I know who's having a baby whether they are using disposables or cloth diapers!
+1	I don't smell anything unless I toss a diaper in, I can tell it's made from good quality too.I like how the diapers pile up like a regular trash bag and not a sausage link which the diaper genie does.  It seems like because of that, you can fit more diapers in it.I am so glad I made this purchase, my hubby loves it, I love it, I highly recommend it!
+1	My daughter is 2-1/2 years old and we have been using the diaper dekor since she was born.  It was wonderful when she was a baby.  It was very easy to dispose of the diapers, just step on the pedal and drop it in.  The other diaper pails you have to adjust, and it is hard enough to keep a squirming baby on the table.  I never had a problem with it smelling.  The only complaint I have is that now that my daughter is a toddler, she loves to lift the lid of the dekor and reach in to take out the dirty diapers.  So now we use the Dekor as a trash can in the bathroom (which works great) and we use the regular trash for her diapers.  I am now expecting another child.  I researched the other pails out there, and even though they are more toddler proof, I think I will stick with the Dekor.  I can't imagine trying to wrestle with a diaper pail with two children.
-1	Mine broke the first week I had it. (One of the inner flap's spring broke.) It does not contain odors very well.However, I do like the foot pedal for opening and it does hold a lot of diapers. I feel like I would have been better off with a regular trash can with a lid though.
+1	I was looking for a pale that would keep the smell of our biodegradable gDiapers at bay and when I saw the biodegradable refills for this, I decided to try it.  It definitely helps with the smell.  Before, I was emptying a lidded garbage can each day and now I only have to do it about once a week.  I keep a box of baking soda in the bottom to absorb some of the odor as well.  It really seems to help.The major selling points for me were:1. Biodegradable refills2. Double barrier lid (flip-up lid and then another trap door type lid)3. Lockable lid (there is a knob that turns to lock the trap door so toddlers can't throw in random items you have to fish out...yuck!)4. Smooth open and close via foot pedalI'm very happy with this purchase.  It's easy to use, keeps the odor down and will actually save me money in the long run, since I don't have to buy a ton of biodegradable garbage bags that need replacing each day.
+1	We have the changing table in our bedroom and the Diaper Dekor right beside it.  For the first year there really wasn't any oder at all.  But as she got older and the "stuff" got stronger, we tend to get a wiff when you walk by now and then (That just tells us that it's time to change the bag, and most times it's pretty full before you start to notice the smell, so it pretty much needs changed anyway)  As long as you change the bags when it's time for the weekly garbage pickup you should be fine.  Getting a fresh bag is quick and easy to do.  You can use this system with one hand. I do highly recommend this.  The only downfall is that I haven't seen the refills at the local Walmart or Target and the nearest Babies R us is 45 minutes away so we order them online. But the bags last a long time.  I had my baby in December 2005 and I am still using the original bags it came with as of February 2006.  Despite the lack of availability of the refills I would buy this product again.  Well worth the money.
+1	We've been using the Diaper Dekor Plus since our baby was born eight months ago. I am very happy with this product. I don't notice any smell and I have a sensitive sniffer. It's very easy to use. The only improvement I could think of is if they designed it so the inside flaps open too when you press down on the foot pedal that opens the lid. This would be good because when it starts to get about half way full you have to push the diaper in rather than just drop it in. That, or, if they made it taller the inner flaps would have more space to go down. TIP - if you roll up the dirty diaper and then fold over the sides using the velcro to secure, you make a little "package" that easily drops into the Diaper Dekor and allows more diapers to fit inside.
+1	Ok, I own a diaper genie and this pail as well. I used to use a regular can for wet diapers, and the genie for the poopy diapers, and it worked fine -until my baby was old enough to start messing with the trash can. At that point, I needed a locked pail, and bought this for wet diapers only. It worked great for that purpose. Then my second baby was born and I started using it for all of the young babies diapers. Again, not too bad, but no it does NOT work as well as the genie. However, the big "pro" to this pail is that you do not HAVE to buy the refills. I actually did buy the refills a couple of times, but came to hate them because when they run out they wouldn't always obviously "stop" like the genie and on more than one occasion I went to empty the pail to find a collapsed bag with a bunch of loose dirty diapers inside. Boy did that make me mad. Now, I simply use cheap 13 gallon kitchen size trash bags (or medium size would work also I believe) and it's very easy to fit them in this pail...tuck it around the top ridge and it won't collapse and it's cheaper than using genie replacements (it holds more than a genie too).In summary, if you buy one pail only, the genie is still the best, you just have to suck up the cost of refills. This makes a great secondary pail for wet diapers. I might also buy a second of THIS pail to keep downstairs for the few diapers we change down there, and to ensure the dogs don't get in the trash which happened a time or two. This is a good "light use" pail with flexible bag options, so for that I give 4 stars.
+1	I live in a trailer and we have super tiny rooms. This pail is a life saver. Since I'm a stay at home mom just about all the poops go in here but you can never tell there's a poop in the tiny room because it keeps the smell in so well! Just hold your breath when you go to throw another in and do it fast! When my husband takes the trash out at night he apologizes to me for having to deal with that smell. I let him think that I dealt with that smell all day but really my baby's room is always clean and fresh smelling! Just a tip: if you have small rooms or just don't want any bad smell in the room, take the pail else where or even outside to tie off the bag. The pail is super lightweight and the bags last a while!
-1	I received this item at my baby shower (11/03) and we still have it. The doors keep falling off, it fills up fast.  My daughter who's into everything have learned how to open the top and remove all the diapers.  She know that the door doesn't close and falls apart, so she's always where the plastic bag is.  We had to put kidco locks on the top to keep the top from opening and another lock on the door, because when we would open it, it would come out of it's holders.  Sure this is a nice pail to keep after the diapers are gone.  But, when it has some stinky diapers in it, it stinks and so does her room.  I have to put air freshners inside it to help with the odor.Not a great pail, it doesn't cost cheap, but it's made cheap.
+1	I use it with the re-usable cloth diapering Dekor Bags and it has been WONDERFUL.If you haven't already added it to your baby registry.... DO IT!  Love the low profile aesthetic as well!
+1	I've been using this pail for 1 month now and it has been wonderful. We are going to buy another one for the upper floor. It contains odor really well (I realize breasted newborns don't stink). The pail looks great too, I bought the sage color. It is really easy to use, you only need one hand which is necessary. Great buy!
+1	When I went shopping for a diaper pail, I did my research because I did not want a pail that was complicated or smelly.  This diaper pail is wonderful!  In the months that we have had it, we have never had a problem with smell.  It fits MANY diapers as well--I find that we have to change it only once every 4-5 days.  The refill pack comes with three refills and each refill lasts us about 2 months.  There is no complicated stuffing and twisting like there is with the other diaper pails (that I have heard from friends do not work as well with keeping smell out of the nursery--ie. Diaper Champ and Diaper Genie).  Using it is as simple as pressing the foot pedal and dropping in the diaper.  I do have to admit that when the pail gets a little full, we tend to pack the diapers down so that the bags will last longer, but I have never had a problem with getting anything on my hands.  The only issue I have with this is that I have it on carpet, and it can be difficult to use the foot pedal because of this (wants to sink into the carpet).  But all I do is simply lift up the lid and drop the diaper in--no problems!  It is very nice looking as well--does not look like a diaper pail, so it could be used as a garbage can in the future (the top diaper drop part comes out so that it can be used for just this reason).  The refills are also very easy to use--just open the lid, drop one in, and pull the bag down and tie a knot.  Very simple.  I would recommend this diaper pail to anyone!
+1	This was the third diaper pail I have purchased in a little over a year.  I have to say, I think that it is my favorite so far.  Both of the others I had purchased were not worth the money... they were either not easily cleaned, or did not block enough of the smell!  This one is a better combination of both.  I like that there is a lever on the bottom you can step on so you dont even have to touch anything if you don't want to.  It is also nice because there is really no chance of making a mess, the top opens and goes right into the bag.  The refills last FOREVER... and I also feel like these bags take a while to fill up.  You can cram a lot in there until it's time to cut off the bag and tie it up. I would definitely recommend this over the rest of the pails!
+1	I have had this diaper pail for about 2 1/2 years, I recieved it at my first sons baby shower. I had actually registered for the Diaper Genie, and was dissapointed when I got this one. After knowing MANY moms who have the genie, I am so happy someone purchased me this one instead! It holds a ton of diapers and pull-ups! My 4 month olds diapers dont stink too much yet, but this pail will handle the job! Honestly, I think I onlyo had a stinky nursery when I over stuffed the bags, didnt clean the PAIL, and didnt keep deoderant circles in it. I find it unnessesary to "dump" the "#2" into the toilet first, this pail handles the job as it is. It is very easy to dump in a diaper one handed, and the refils last months, litteraly! I just bought refils a few days ago, my other ones I had since my second son came home from the hospital, four months ago! My 2 1/2 year old can not figure out how to open this though (thank goodness!) and he is not potty trained, but will be soon! This tackels all odors and refils really arent that expensive. I love it, and my house guests are amazed that I actually change diapers in my house, not one whiff!
-1	I was pretty excited when I ordered this diaper can, it seemed like a good concept, and I didn't want to do a diaper genie. It is a good idea, unfortunately it doesn't play out as well in reality. The plastic has absorbed the odors of dirty and wet diapers, so now, even when it is empty it smells....bad. It left my daughter's room with a dirty diaper smell. In order to attempt to solve this issue without getting rid of it I have scrubbed the empty can down with bleach and odor eliminator, have sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the new bag and have bought Arm and Hammer diaper trash bags to tie each individual dirty dirty diaper in before throwing away in the Dekor. Hopefully this will help with the stink.
+1	Our oldest is 3, and this diaper pail has been doing its job, right next to my bed that entire time (now containing the stinky diapers from our younger son for the past 19 months).In light of the 600 other reviews for this product, I'll boil it down to these four points:(1) It really does contain smell, despite its simplicity. I have a very sensitive nose, and the only time I catch the odor from within is if I purposely hold the two flap doors open and take a whiff, or when I'm changing the bag and compacting the full one with my knee to squeeze all the air out (definitely an outside task -- stinky!).(2) Price the bags before hand, because as others have pointed out, they're the real expense over time.(3) Our secondary flapper door was hanging open the past few weeks, probably the result of a loose spring affected by corrosion (the air stays moist inside this pail). I shopped around for a repair kit and came up empty, so emailed the company. They quickly -- and gratis -- sent out a replacement flapper door that easily snapped into place.  Problem solved.(4) It's pretty durable. Our oldest regularly climbs and sits on this -- says it's his rocket. He hasn't managed to break anything, despite it being very conventional construction (i.e. lightweight, not overbuilt, though I hesitate to call it flimsy).
+1	This is a MUST HAVE!!!!  We had a Diaper Genie with our other children and I must say that the Diaper Dekor is a much better product.  It's easier to put diapers in, easier to change the refill and easier to dispose of the used diapers.  We like it much better.  There is no fiddling around with spinning the top like the Diaper Genie.  You just step on the foot pedal to open the top and drop in the diaper.  You can even do it while holding the baby.  It also controls the odor very well.  Our 11 year-old handles taking out the trash and he has not had any problem with the handling the Diaper Dekor.  We would definitely recommend this product and plan to buy it as a gift for our expecting friends.
+1	This diaper pail is great because it can hold a lot of diapers and has a great little flap that keeps the diaper smell trapped away. I totally recommend this product.
+1	We've had the Dekor for 8 months now and are very pleased with it.  It's easy to use, looks good, and mostly keeps the stinky diaper smell out of the nursery.  I mean, you have a bag full of poopy diapers....I think no matter what trashcan you use some stink is going to get out.  But I love that with the Dekor bags you can just cut it off wherever you want and toss it in the trash without feeling like you're wasting a bag.  One thing that could be made better, though, is to have the lid swing all the way open when you're changing the bag cartridge out.
-1	I have only been using this diaper pail for 7 weeks, and I hate it. I have two boys in diapers - one about to turn 2, the other 7 weeks old. The pail is so tiny, I have to change the bag daily. When it gets more than half full, the top won't close, letting out all the poop odors. Because the second inner door flap goes inwards, it prevents you from being able to fill a bag completely because it runs into the diapers. This also causes that inner door flap to get a little gross. The pail is insanely expensive, as are the refills. I have started using my own bags, but they are a pain to put in and take out. I really expected more and am very disappointed! I'm glad this was a gift - I won't feel TOO bad when I toss it!
+1	We have had this for 7 1/2 months and are just now using the last bag in our first refill pack. No issues with odor or use. It's easier than Diaper Genie and you don't have to touch it to throw away a diaper, because there's a foot pedal.
+1	I picked this off the reviews and I am not disappointed! I love this pail... There is not stink, it is SUPER easy to use when you are half awake, and emptying it is easy as pie.
+1	Plus:1.  Easy to use.  The foot pedal works great and the cutting edge for the bags is really convenient.2.  Good odor control.3.  Liners really do last a long time, making them less expensive than they seem at first- definitely cheaper than the Genie's.  Even regular trash bags cost something...4.  The style (foot pedal controlled flip-up top with trap doors in) makes it impossible for our puppy to get into, and this dog is an expert at trash cans.  He hasn't even made a move for it, which says something impressive about its odor control.5.  Holds a lot of diapers- we empty about every 5 days.Minus:1.  It's nearly impossible to find the refill liners in stores (I've seen them once at Baby Depot, never at BRS, Target, Walmart, or anywhere else) so they need to be ordered ahead of time, which means we always have to pay shipping for them as well.2.  A minor point, but it is hard to tell when the liner is about to run out.  So long as you've ordered extras ahead of time, this isn't a big deal, but if you haven't, you're in trouble for a couple of days.
+1	Having never used another diaper pail before, I can't compare this product to those. But what I can say is that I am totally happy with this pail. I find it easy to use, contains odors, is easy to empty and refill, and looks fairly modern yet not an eyesore. It also seems to hold a fair number of diapers. We only have to empty it about once a week or even less, but we also tend to stuff it to the very top! Sometimes I have noticed an odor when I go to put another diaper in, but that is almost always because it's too full and I'm literally shoving another one in there, therefore allowing time for odors to escape! When it's closed up, no odors. My son is now 6 months and starting solids, so we will see if the smell is still contained once his poops really start stinking :-)Agree though with one other reviewer that it would be nice if you got a heads up that the bag inside was almost out (like changing color or something).
+1	When I babysat 10+ years ago in junior high I always got confused with the diaper genie, but this is so simple and easy to use. I did find that this was about $10-$15 overpriced on Amazon compared to Babies'R'Us and Buy Buy Baby. This product has held up well in the 8 months we've used it and keeps the room from not smelling.
+1	As a first time mom I was pleasantly surprised to find this diaper pail actually works! So many of my friends tried Diaper Genie and others and claimed that no diaper disposal system really keeps out the smell or works very well. I found that the claims Diaper Dekor makes are true. It is very easy to dispose of the bag when it is full and there is no diaper odor in my daughter's nursery. So nice to find a product that delivers on its claims.
+1	This diaper pail is great! I read a few other reviews and would like to comment based on them.Our son will be 5 months old this week. He was exclusively breastfed, then had formula added to his diet, and now also eats jarred foods. Regardless of what he eats and what his "output" is, as long as you close the diaper the way you should, this pail holds in odors just as well as any other diaper disposal system does.I personally think the design is ingenious! The liner sets in the top of the pail and you pull it through to the bottom and make a knot in the bottom. To dispose of the diapers, you just step on a pedal. The top lifts up, you drop the diaper, and it falls through the "flaps." When it's full, you open the door on the front and cut the liner off (there is a liner-cutter in the door). You are totally in control of how much liner you use and therefore don't have to waste or have a huge portion of liner that is unfilled. Then you just tie a new knot and pull the liner down to fill the pail, and you're ready to start again! The system comes with one liner refill, and refills are sold 3 to a pack (I see them all the time at my Babies 'R' Us, and my Babies 'R' Us almost never has anything in stock!). We are on the first refill in the first pack. We had bought 2 packs of refills when we got the system, and I seriously wonder if we will ever need to purchase another one...or if we'll even use all of what we bought!One reviewer stated that the system should tell you when the bag is about to run out because you could be tossing your diaper into the pail w/out a liner. I'm really not sure how that would ever happen, as you are the one who has to open the side of the pail to remove the full bag and pull down the new liner. If you go to pull down the liner and it you hit the end of the refill...well, it's like saying you don't know when your paper towel roll comes to an end. You pull and there is no more.Someone also commented on the flaps, and how the diapers don't fall through. I disagree with that. Regardless of my son's age, as long as he urinated more than once in his diaper and there was any kind of weight to it at all, it would fall through. Only if it was completely dry would it not fall through. And even then, if you just take your foot off the pedal and let the top fall down, it would push it through anyway. The one area I do agree with that person in, though, is that when the pail starts filling up, if you really want to maximize the liner and not change it right away, you DO have to push down on the top diaper to get it to go down far enough for the flaps to close again. But I have never touched another dirty diaper doing this, and I think that it's still worth not having to reach down and lift and push and twist, like you do with the Diaper Genie.There were also comments on refilling the liner. No, it is not as simple as dropping a bag in, like you would a regular trash can. But it most certainly is not complicated. There is a drawing that shows you how to do it, and once it's done, you won't be doing it again for months. Also, when you change the liner, it is SO easy to take the top pieces apart to clean them. I think it's very easy to keep this system clean & sanitary.All that said, if you're looking for the easiest possible route to dispose of dirty diapers, use your regular garbabe can and take the trash out frequently! If you're looking for a disposal system so you don't have to worry about constantly getting dirty diapers out of your house, I'd really have to say this one is the way to go!
+1	I used the diaper dekor 8 yrs ago with my first daughter and purchased it again with my new little girl and it's just gotten better. They've made improvements to make it easier to use and very clean.  Would highly recommend.  Keeps the mess and the smell where it belongs.
+1	I had some personal recommendations on the Diaper Dekor, I read the reviews and decided to get it.  Overall, I am very pleased with it.  It has a foot pedal to open the lid and you can drop the diaper through the trap doors.  The pedal does not work exceptionally well on plush carpet because there is little firm support underneath it, but it's good enough.  You can always put some plywood under the pail and pedal for extra support.  Also, if you have a dirty diaper, the mess could get on the trap doors if that part of the diaper hits them.  When full, the pail is very easy to empty.  Open the bottom compartment, pull out the plastic tube/bag with the dirty diapers, cut it and throw it away.  Then pull the tube/bag down, tie a new knot in it and the pail is ready to fill again.  The refills are a bit tricky to replace the first time, but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy.  The refill bags last a long time.  There are three to a box and we've only used two boxes in eight months.  There is no way of knowing when a refill bag is near the end though, so you may not be left with enough to hold the diapers and the dirty diapers may be loose in the pail.  This has happened to me a couple of times and it's not a big deal to clean up.  It would be nice if the plastic had a red stripe toward the end of it like cash register receipt papaer does, so you'd know when it's about out.This diaper pail does not do anything fancy with the diaper, such as roll it up into a sausage, but you can roll it up if you want to save space and fit more diapers in the pail.  When your child is eating solids though, you will probably want to empty the pail daily.  Each time you open the lid to put a new dirty diaper in, the smell of the previously discarded diapers wafts into the room.  I've tried adding some baby powder or baking soda to the bag to help absorb the odor.  I also got some diaper pail deodorizers from Babies R Us that seem to help mask the smell.
+1	Our baby, now 5 months old, loves his Pupsqueak and has since he was 4 or 5 weeks old. The soft plush, the bright colors, that cute bark, the squeak, the rattle, those crinkly ears--what's not to love? He loves to touch and pat it all over, pulling and grabbing each part to make all the sounds. He loves to chew on the attached bone and squeeze it to make the crinkle sound.Like all Lamaze toys, it's well designed and well made. It even has a handy clip on top of the head to attach it to your carrier, bouncy seat or diaper bag.The only negative is it must be spot cleaned; my baby drools all over it, so when I wash it, it's out of commission until it dries completely, which is usually the next day. But that's the same with all soft toys that can't be machine washed, so it's not a serious drawback.
+1	Next to BR Max the monkey (also by Lamaze) and Zach's "lovey", pupsqueak is his favorite toy. Zach is four months old and really really loves pupsqueak. We use him to give variety to our son and Zach really loves him! If we make pupsqueak squeak, Zach goes into hysterics, and my 20 month old twins join in! ITs perfect for those really silent times when everyone needs a good laugh. Along with Max, pups (what we call him) is perfect for tummy time. Pups is also great for teathing, once Zach really starts getting those teeth in! Pups attatches well to almost anything, but my boistrus ball of fire gets so angrey and fustrated if we tether him to anything, he likes to hold him. Pups is very durable and has been easily spot cleaned and even in the wash! The colors are great for my son to stare at and he just loves him. I dont know what it is about Lamaze toys but they sure do put alot of thought into them to make them so gosh darn cute and interesting!
+1	When I first saw this toy I thought it looked busy and a little annoying but when I hung it above my 2 month old son's changing table he loved it. He smiles and "talks" to it, and he is just starting to bat at it and he is rewarded with jingle bells even when he barely hits it. It was the first toy he likes, we call him puppy.
+1	My three month old daughter loves this toy. She likes the dangling bone and loves the crackling of the ears.  The barking sound that the dog makes is a sound catcher.
+1	I have two faves and I alternate between the two for various reasons.  I am pumping 100% because my daughter will not latch on (another story - issues with losing >10% and having to supliment with a bottle with expressed milk - nipple confusion) so finding the right pad to put on always sensitive nipples is critical.  Writing the same review for both.FavesPhilips AVENT Disposable Nursing PadsPROS:- Softer than Lansinoh- works really well when nipples are very tender and drying out makes it worse- regardless of what cream/balm I used, sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds do not stick (only occasionally)CONS:- they are a little bulkier than Lansinoh so they may show through some bras- when I was in the leaking stage (or when I go a little too long between my night and morning pumping session) I have occasionally leaked through the padLansinoh Disposable Nursing PadsPROS:- Thinner and larger in diameter than Avent- keeps nipples drier- I don't think that I have ever leaked throughCONS:- not as soft as Advent- sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds stick to pad and sometimes tear off scabs (sorry this sounds so gross, but it happens)I usually use Avent when my nipples are in bad shape (seems to go in cycles) because they are softer and my wounds don't stick and then switch to Lansinoh when they are healing and need to dry out.
-1	I love avent products but they weren't thinking when they made these. They are way too small and way too thick. Feels like a maxi pad.
+1	These are great for nursing mothers.  I've given these as a baby shower gift along with an Avert breast pump before.  They were received well and I've been told they're comfortable and very convenient.
-1	These pads are too small and too thick. They fall right out of your bra when you go to nurse your baby. They also look very unflattering under clothing. I like the Lansinoh pads much better as they are thin and large which means they can be folded over when you open the bra flap to nurse. Don't waste your money on Avent pads!
+1	Thank goodness for these!  Great packaging because I go through a lot as they should be changed often.  No plastic so they breathe.
-1	I didn't like them.... They are too small and very thick, they show thru your clothes. I use instead the evenflow, they are very thin and larger than this.
-1	These pads are a complete waste of money. I started usingLansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-packwhich are awesome! But I was hoping that these would work because they are a little cheaper. They might work for you if you have extremely light or practically non-existent leakage. But even in that case, the absorbent material used in this product performs like a thin circular cotton ball -- it doesn't draw the moisture away from your skin, which was extremely irritating to my skin and made me feel edgy and damp all the time.So here are the cons of this product:-There is no waterproof backing on these pads (which is good for preventing thrush) but is BAD for holding leaks. My shirt and bra would end up damp anyway.-The absorbent material does not draw moisture away from skin. My skin would end up wet and damp and hot. Very uncomfortable.-I had to change these pads constantly if I wanted to feel dry and comfortable--thus removing the whole purpose of replacing a wonderful product -Lansinoh pads- with a terrible but cheaper product.-The mesh material that covered the absorbent material is irritating to my skin and would stick to the skin when I removed the pad. The mesh material also allowed fibers through that would stick all over my skin which would then end up rubbing off on my baby's face.-These pads are small but puffy, which would often show up in silhouette if wearing even a slightly fitted shirt.-
+1	I was trying out different breastpads, this among them. It came with a trial pair of the nighttime pads, they're thicker and worked great. The daytime version works very well, they're soft and cushy with a nice contour. They'd be perfect if there was a second sticky pad. As they are, they travel all over my bra or nursing tank and get flipped down when I go to nurse. It's a trial to get it back in place when I'm trying to 'zip up' after nursing, with a curious 4 month old looking and squirming around I'm fumbling with a bunched up nursing pad. In a pinch I'd definitely pick up a package but my primary will be lansinoh's disposables.
-1	These pads are too thick and too small... I usedEvenflo 60 Count Simplyabsorbent Nursing Padbefore and liked them better. Will not buy Avent's anymore...
+1	Yes these pads are thicker than most.  I usually put them over my fist and try to shape them "rounder" before I put them in my bra.I like these the best because they don't have the plastic liner on the backs.  This is important to me because I don't want "liquid" locked in between plastic and my skin.  Also, I don't feel as if they are as "hot".I wish I could say they were too small but I have found them to be the perfect size for smaller women A-B cups.  I have never had a leak-through and have been very pleased with the success of these pads.
+1	i find this super absorbent compare to the thin breast pads i have but i'm giving this a 4 star because the tape that's suppose to be attached to your nursing tank or bras doesn't really adhere to the fabric. again in terms of absorbency it does its wonderful job. it has thick layers it keeps leaks away from your skin. i love it. great deal for the price.
+1	I prefer Avent breast pads to Gerber and Lansinoh as they are more absorbent, stay in place with adhesive and are really comfortable to wear. I found that Gerber pads leaked straight through and Lansinoh pads were too thin and I hated that wet and burning sensation when wearing them [I leaked a lot and the pads got soaked in minutes and were rubbing my nipples badly :(] Avent pads are realy cushy and soft, and they conform to the natural shape of the breast. They are also perfectly sized: had they been a little bigger, they would hardly fit in the bra. I think they are inexpensive enough for you to try (there're trial 2-packs and packs of 40 pads for less than $5 at Target and Babies'R'Us/Toys'R'us stores). I really like Avent pads better than any other disposable pads I tried. :)
-1	I tried these pads first after being so happy with other Avent products. Unlike other Avent products these pads are barely passable for the job. They are very thick, you can see them through clothing, the diameter is far too small so even a small shift and they will leak. After many leaks with these I switched to Lansinoh pads.
+1	Excellent product.  Simple to install and effectively ends all worries about my son accidentally choking on the rubber end of a typical door stop.
+1	Easy to unscrew the existing door jam and screw this one in it's place - they even provide a screw. One piece, so kids can't pull off the tip of the door jam and potentially choke.
+1	my son got this toy for christmas and was too young for it, but i brought it out when he was 6 mos old and he absolutely loved it.he plays with the balls and drops them in the basket, and it's fun for the cat as well because he tries to get the balls out of the tray as well!fun for the whole family.and very durable.  it's banged around a lot and has held up.def worth the money.
+1	this toy:is easy to put togetherdurableeasily (and securely) claps shut to transition to ride-oncolorfulhas cute musici cannot think of anything i dislike about this toy. it even has little area in the front for baby's feet so you can push them.
+1	My daughter has loved this toy since the day she got it.  She got it for Christmas when she was almost 11 months old.  She was already walking, but not steadily.  This toy gave her confidence and she loves the silly face and fun music.  She also loves when we convert it to a ride on toy and push her around.  Now that she is 1 she loves to put things in the basket and truck around the house.  she also loves to push the nose and just dance to the music.  The motion sensor on this toy is real sensitive so it doesn't have to be banged to play.  My daughter just has to walk up to it and it will play.  Also, it isn't so loud that is can be mind numbing and the beat is kinda catchy.  My neice who is almost two recieved this on her first birthday and used it for a walker until recently.  She still uses it to push around, but now she really loves to sit on it and scott around.  This is really a useful toy and really fun.  My daughter doesn't really care about the balls that come with it she uses the basket more to push around other toys and her stuffed animal.  She also loves the ram into things with it and since it is lightweight it doesn't hurt anything.  Another good point is that it has all rounded edges so when she biffs she doesn't seem to get hurt.  she just gets up, rights the walker, and keeps on movin'.  This toy is sturdy and easy for my daughter to move around.  I find that it doesn't get away from her like other walking toys did.  I think the width of the toy and the wide wheels help to keep the toy moving at a good pace.  If you want your child to use a walker to help him/her get used to her feet and have fun doing it, this is the toy, plus it is convertible and will last beyond a year.  It is very affordable and worth every penny.
+1	We first had another monitor from a different company, it went dead.  We love this monitor so far (knock on wood.)  You never know how these things will go.  We could not live without one of these monitors though.  If it broke, I would buy another one.  We use it that much.  In fact, we have a tele. monitor in our bedroom, and bought another monitor for the livingroom.  We love it!
+1	WOW! We love our video monitor! This has really helped our transition to getting our son into his own room at night! Our son was perfectly fine when we transitioned him to his own room, but my husband and I were a nervous wreck! This monitor helps us keep peace of mind and be able to rest. We have had minimal problems with static and the sound/picture quality is great - even the night vision feature! We can check to see his position (I am always nervous about him smooshing his face into the mattress when he rolls around), his breathing and the geographic locale of his pacifier! We get a kick out of seeing our son exploring in his crib and not even knowing he has an audience!Also, when he is napping, it makes it easy to check on him without actually entering his room - which always used to wake him up.I understand from the other reviews that durability and longevity may be an issue with this item. I can't comment on that because we have only had it for 2 months. But for us, 2 months of sleep has been worth the investment already even if it tanks later...
-1	The purpose of a baby monitor is to free you up for household chores while still allowing you to know that junior is safe and sound. Audio does this nicely. Video only works if you sit there and watch it (which defeats the purpose of freeing you up for chores), and if it has audio, as this one does, then why even HAVE video?? Video is an unnecessary expense, because just what is there to SEE inside a baby's crib anyway? There shouldn't be anything dangerous in there anyway!!!! Save the $ and get an audio. As someone else pointed out, reception isn't always good on this model either.  Video monitors are a ploy to get well-meaning parents, eager to protect their children ("if you don't get this, you're an irresponsible parent!"), to spend more money. Look at the price tag on this compared to a simple audio.  Sell yours on ebay, spend ten bucks for a good audio monitor, and put the rest in baby's college fund where you'll get much more use out of it.
+1	After reading the other reviews, I was apprehensive to spend $100 on something that wouldn't work properly. To my surprise, it exceeded my expectations. After moving our 4 month old from our room to hers to sleep in her crib, we found that the monitor had excellent range. Our room is on the opposite side of the house, across the kitchen and living room, and we were still able to get excellent sound and picture. THe picture is so clear you can see her chest rise and fall, and the sound is so good you can hear her shift in the night. I am not sure why some reviewers couldn't get reception 5 feet from their baby's room. Maybe they didn't know the monitor had 2 channels?I recommend this to anyone. I was nervous about being so far away all night, but this monitor gives me peace of mind. In addition, it is lightweight and portable. I take it to the bathroom while I get ready for work and to the computer room while I do work, to the kitchen while I cook, etc....A must have for new parents - well worth the money!!
+1	Once you figure out which way your carseat goes in, this product is AMAZING!  I was able to fit a large carseat in it as well as some other junk that would not fit in my suitcase.  I LOVE this item!!!!  Very durable, and keeps your carseat protected from abusive handling by the airlines!  Don't hesitate - buy this!
+1	When I was traveling alone with my baby, it allowed me to push a stroller, pull a suitcase, and carry the carseat at one time.  If I can make one addition to the carrier, it would be to add another strap so that an adult can wear it like a backpack.
-1	These new cups are awful. We had a couple of them from late 2012 that were awesome.  The lids were easy to screw on and they never leaked.  Then Playtex redesigned the lid and now they are really hard to get closed, sometimes hard to open, and they leak if you don't get them exactly right.  I just got done clearing out the shelves of my local pharmacies at 8:30 at night trying to find the old style (Yay, got 3!) because we put our son to bed tonight with a cup of ice water and he woke up 20 minutes later because he was lying in a freezing cold puddle.  His cup was apparently not screwed together properly and it leaked all over his bed.  I do not appreciate changing sheets for no reason.  This is not the first time we've had the cups leak on us.  I will use the old style until he chews the spouts to death, which is what happened to our old set, and then I will find another brand.  I'm not sure what the point of the redesign was since the old style was perfect.  Please bring back the old style!!!!
+1	We love the Playtex Insulators. We tried a whole bunch of cups when my youngest hit the sippy age, and these were the best by far. This is one of our many purchases as we have added to our sets over the years. We do find that after a while the plastic valves need replacing, and occasionally I have thrown away a lid but only after a long time (years). One note of caution, do not try to boil these as it warps the cups and then the seal is not correct. That may seem obvious but I have heard of several people doing it so it is worth mentioning.
+1	These are the BEST sippy cups. Super durable and don't leak at all! I have used them for all my kids and always gift them at baby showers for new moms as well! -mother of 3
-1	I have tried over a half dozen sippy cups (playtex, nubby, sassy and munchkin) with my daughter and these are my favorite. (I really liked a munchkin cup, but they changed their design and lost their lead). These hardly ever leak, take a lot of abuse and keep drinks cool. I would actually recommend them to others.Update: Playtex has updated this product with a different valve and locking system on the lid. I bought one of the new spout cups with the circle valve as a replacement for one of my original design spout cups that melted in the dishwasher. The top leaks like crazy! Every time my daughter took a sip it leaked from the area between the top and the cup. A regular cup with no lid would have been less messy. I attempted to let my daughter use this cup multiple times, ensuring the lid was securely on and it leaked every single time. I am beyond disappointed that Playtex has replaced a good product with a product that is frankly, garbage.
+1	I bought these for my son because I wanted something that would keep his drinks cool and didn't leak. I have not had any problem with them leaking although they will lose some fluid if dropped on the floor, but it doesn't continue to leak. They do a great job at keeping drinks cool, they are easy to wash and if they do start to leak the valve is replaceable. I use this cup every day.
-1	I bought these without noticing they had changed the lid of the cup.  The new lid is terrible.  It is hard to get it on correctly and often looks like it is on when it isn't.  I have cleaned up numerous leaks from these cups already.Oh, and would it really be that much trouble for you to add the options of 'girl, 'boy' or 'unisex' style cups?  Or, just send out unisex options?Will not be purchasing these again.
+1	We've tried several different cups and these are by far the best.  They are easy to click closed, barely leak, and the valves come out easy for washing. My biggest head ache with sippy cups are reassembling the valves after washing and these are the easiest.  My kids also love them.As another reviewer posted you might need to replace the valves every now and again because they dont age well.
+1	We have been using Playtex sippies for about four years now, for two children and they are by and large the best of all that we've tried.There are other attractive models out there, but they tip over easily (what marketing genius thought a narrower at the bottom than at the top design was a good idea!) and don't last. The plastic that they are made out of is hard and it eventually cracks-- dropped or from dishwasher wear.The Playtex models (either insulated or not) stay upright (most of the time LOL) and are easily cleaned by hand or in a dishwasher.(Hand tested on vacation and at nana's.)The only thing that we have done to maintain them is to replace the valve thingies as they will start to age after a year or so and leak despite what other reviewers have said. These replacement valves are cheap though and no problem to find.As to insulation, they insulate to a limited extent but don't expect to have your milk stay good for more than an hour or so in a hot environment. (Tested in Florida, Texas, and Virginia.)Five Stars. The best that we have used and we have tested just about everything on the market.
+1	We've tried tons of sippies and these are our favorite. Doesn't leak, even when thrown. Only thing we use for juice.
-1	Like many other reviewers, I am a huge fan of traditional Playtex sippy cups. They truly are the gold standard. They last forever, don't leak, and are cute as well. This new line that they came out with is just terrible. After 2 washings they leak all over the place. I don't know whether it's the new valves or the cup lids themselves, but they are completely useless. I'm stalking other sites to find the originals so I can stock up because these new ones are a disaster.
+1	I did not use this with my son's infant seat. I used the Fisher Price bugs (great product!) I bought this item for his stroller. So far, so good. He enjoys playing with it when we are out and about. The toys kept him entertained for a while, I guess a few months. I recently bought the Tiny love trio to switch out the other toys with and now he is playing with it again. Now that he is older he does pull it off the stroller, but he is still enjoying it and I haven't lost any toys. Overall, fun stroller toy.
-1	My 3 month old loves playing with this toy when he is in his car seat, but he can now grab the toys and pull them.  When he does this the arch comes off the car seat and it has already it him twice on the head.  I wish that this product was designed better because my son really does love it.
-1	This is a nice little clip on toy to entertain your child, however, it is very hard to clip onto my daughter's Quattro Tour Latch Travel System (Graco). I was able to get it on, after about 20 minutes of work, but it wouldn't stay in an upright position. Before you buy this toy, make sure that your stroller or carseat, etc. has a thin bar/rail that the toy can be attached to.One bonus- it did fold very easily and fit nicely into my daughter's diaper bag.
+1	This hamper looks great and is very simple and understated, so it fits in with pretty much any decor.  It has an interior mesh bag that easily pulls out so you're not bending over or struggling to get those socks at the bottom out!  So convenient!
+1	I like the wooden legs as they go with my maple furniture.I like the simplicity of it, as when the kid grows up, it does not sream "baby stuff".Nothing fancy and very practical.BUY IT, you won't regret it :)
+1	This hamper is a great asset to the nursery! It is neutral and will be able to 'grow' with the child as the decor changes and it's easy to empty - the mesh liner comes out and goes back in very easily. I highly recommend this hamper.. a great value!
+1	We purchased this for our daughter's nursery and have been using it for almost nineteen months now--and it still is in perfect condition!  I was nervous about potential tears to the inside mesh liner (the removable "laundry bag" part of the hamper) but have had no problems whatsoever.I love that there is a "lid" (a flap of cloth) that folds over the top of the frame to hide the laundry inside--it is the perfect spot for me to keep a small mesh bag (lingerie bag) to put my daughter's dirty socks in...that way we never have to worry about losing socks in the wash!This hamper is very convienent, relatively sturdy, and doesn't scream "baby"--so if you need to keep it in a room other than the nursery, it won't look too out of place.Now that we're expecting our second child, I plan on purchasing another one of these hampers.
+1	It's the perfect size, not too big, and the removable netted insert makes it easy to take his clothes to the washer.I highly recomment this to all moms!  It could also carry though to adulthood!
+1	This is the perfect laundry basket for any nursery! It is a little big, but ended up being the perfect size for us. Think about it, within no time your baby's clothes will be so much bigger so might as well get a bigger basket to begin with. I love the idea of the pull-out mesh bag which makes laundry time so much easier. Before I got this, I would separate the laundry before washing and the baby's clothes would always be in a separate pile-now it's automatically separated; just pull out the bag when it's time for a load and dump it in. It's also great that it's mesh so that it keeps airflow going through and doesn't promote mold growth. And such a great price as well!
+1	I purchased this pillow early in my second trimester and thought it was ok. Now I'm 39 weeks and have been using it nightly for the past two months & attribute the pillow completely to the comfort and sleep I get.
+1	At first I was using the pillow upside down and I wasn't totally crazy about it, but once I flipped it I can't sleep without it.  This is a very, very comfortable, versatile, pillow.  This is my third pregnancy and I wish I had found this sooner!I sleep with the the smaller (more curved) end under my head and the wider (less curved) part in between my legs and under my belly.  The long straight part goes along my back to provide support when I sleep on my side or even if I want to turn so I'm sleeping slightly on my back.  This is a big plus for a pregnant lady, not having to sleep directly on my left side all of the time.  Having the pillow behind your back and neck keeps you from being flat on your back, which can be uncomfortable and is not recommended because it can put pressure on the vena cava.  I also sometimes sleep with my belly facing the straight/long part of the pillow.  The lower end wraps in between my legs far enough to provide back support in this position.The head part of the pillow is a good height, so you won't need an additional pillow for your head.  The curve provides a nice space for your shoulder when you're sleeping on your side.  I am 5'7&#34; and the pillow is long enough to support my head and then wrap all the way around, in between my legs and up under my belly.  I have a queen-size bed and my husband and my BFF pillow and I all fit fine in it.I have also found this pillow useful when sitting up in bed - you can curl it up behind you or wrap it around your waist (with an additional pillow behind your head) to provide support for your arms if you are reading, typing, etc.I will probably continue to use this after I have the baby.  It may prove to be useful for breastfeeding, although it is not as portable as a Boppy-style pillow.
+1	I normally sleep on my stomach and needed a supportive pillow to adapt to sleeping on my side.  Now that I have had my little one I don't want to stop using the pillow because I have gotten so used to it.  I recommend this to all my pregnant friends.
+1	I have used this since I first started &#34;showing&#34; and could no longer sleep on my belly.  Which was a big deal for me because I am normally a belly sleeper.  This has made sleeping so much easier.  I am now 33 weeks pregnant and am still loving this pillow.  I only wished I had known about it during my first pregnancy.
+1	A friend bought me this pillow as a gift during my first pregnancy.  I am now 5.5 months through my second pregnancy, and I consider it an absolute necessity.  I don't think I would have bought it for myself because it seemed like too much money to spend on such a specialized pillow that is huge and a pain to store.  BUT--I am now convinced that it is essential for sleeping during pregnancy!  It is so much more comfortable than any arrangement of other pillows, and well worth the price.  I credit this pillow for helping me get more sleep during both of my pregnancies.  My husband even likes it--he uses it when I am out of town!It is quite big and bulky--like another body in the bed.  There is no good way to make the bed with this pillow in it, so we've just given up on trying to make the bed look normal with this pillow in it.  It either gets moved to the floor when the bed is made, or we pull the covers up over it and it looks like someone is still sleeping in the bed.  Oh well - It is well worth it for the 6-9 months of pregnancy that it helps me sleep!
+1	I bought this when I first got pregnant and didn't see the big deal. Well 6-7 months later this became a life saver. I don't know how I would have slept without it. Once you hit the 3rd trimester this pillow is key to get any kind of sleep.
+1	I love this pillow.  It provides exactly the right support and I sleep comfortably through the night.  I wish I knew about this when I was pregnant with my first child.
+1	This pillow was a lifesaver.  I got a lot of hip pain during pregnancy.  The trick is to use the curvier end of this pillow between the thighs while sleeping as it helps straighten the hips out.  One night without this and I would be miserable.  I kept the long side toward the inside of the bed, so I could get out and pee easily during the night.  Husband not a fan of this in our queen sized bed, but I was desperate and we made do.  The only disadvantages were that the cover is difficult to put back on after laundering.  Also, the instructions that came with it showed the pillow coiled up to be used as a back pillow but this never worked as it tended to spring open unexpectedly and send bedside items crashing to the floor.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat though.  I got pretty practiced at switching sides and rewrapping my legs around it and was so much better than retrieving a regular pillow from the floor all night.  I am 5' 7&#34; and 200lbs + during pregnancy and this held up great.
+1	I didn't buy a pregnancy pillow with my first pregnancy and now I really wish I did!! The snoogle is awesome! I must admit when I first saw it out of the box I thought it was too narrow and that I might have to return it, but I decided to give it a shot and I LOVE IT! It's not too soft or too hard, it's just perfect and it conforms perfectly to your body. I'm really glad I bought this. Now I wish I had bought the one that goes all the way around your body. That way you can turn without having to move the entire pillow. Absolutely recommend this product to all pregnant women looking for comfort at night.
+1	I had pain in my hips very early on in the first trimester and this pillow was a miracle worker and relieved my pain and allowed me to sleep comfortably. I slept so well with this pillow throughout my pregnancy I had a hard time giving it up after my son was born. It also gave great support for my growing belly. It is rather large but we have a king sized bed so it wasn't an issue for us. Worth the investment!
-1	Way too big, it's ridiculous. Hard to sleep with. I would have returned it if it wasn't such a hassle to return the giant thing.
+1	I must say that I could not even imagine the number of possible ways and positions this body pillow can be used. Currently being at my second trimester I it helps me to fix my position on the tilted safe left side and serves as a stopper so that I accidentally won't roll onto my stomach  or even press in any way. Super thick, soft and comfortable and doesn't sink down over time (been using for several months now). Definitely recommend the product and it is cheaper than at the Maternity/Motherhood store, even at the outlet you can't find as good deal as here at amazon.
+1	I was having the hardest time trying to make myself sleep on my side and I would wake up every morning in pain and on my back. This pillow helped a lot. I sleep with the long side to my back. This way even if I try to roll over I'm not completely on my back. The fabric is not soft so I put a regular pillow case where my head rests. I don't feel like the pillow is too hard. I would prefer a little more stuffing in the head area to prop me up just a little more, but my head is comfortable throughout the night. I think the biggest problem with this is that when you put the end through the legs and then bring it up under the belly, there isn't much pillow between the lefts to align the hips, so I sometimes wake up with sore hips. I think it helps to put an extra pillow between the legs. The pillow is large and getting situated for bed can be annoying. Also makes it a bit hard to cuddle with your partner, but I usually just make sure the loge side is facing the outside of the bed. Overall this pillow is really comfortable. My boyfriend likes to steal it. I'll probably keep using even after I'm pregnant.
+1	7 months along, it gets tougher finding ways to sleep more comfortably through the night.Pros: Curved and contoured so that your neck and legs are supported.  Also, allows you to flip from side to side without having to rearrange the pillow which you would need to do with a regular body pillow.Cons: Material of the pillow is not the softest and they should improve that for sure.That's it.  It works for me :)
-1	I told myself that if I ever got pregnant again that I would splurge on a pregnancy pillow!  Well, I did and hated this thing.  After 2 nights with it, I could not tolerate it.  Both mornings I woke-up with a sore neck and there is not a good way to turn it over in the middle of the night when you are covered by a sheet.  I actually, had to get out of the bed, pull the sheet back, flip the pillow over, and hop back into bed.  If the pillow was on the edge nearest the side of the bed, good luck trying to get out in the middle of the night for restroom break!  The leg support was the only thing that was decent.  I decided this was not a splurge; I will take my 10 pillows any day over this uncomfortable pillow!
+1	I'm using this pillow for about a week now and here's what I noticed.I'm at 27 weeks and my belly is not too big, but it still caused me a lot of trouble while sleeping. I had to spend about 10 minutes every night getting comfortable enough with all the pillows, and of course by the time I do (pretty much) I'd have to get up and go to the bathroom :)I now use the Snoogle pillow along with only 2(!) extra pillows and it does help.I'll skip the pros part as the other reviewers did a good job describing them. But here are the cons that could definetely be improved by the manufacturer:1. The seam that goes all the way on the inside curve of the pillow is very stiff when the pillow is stretched around your body. This is very uncomfortable as I usually feel it either on my shoulder, neck or the chest depending on the position I take.It is touching all those soft areas and feels almost like a cardboard across the skin.2. The fabric of the pillow is kind of rough and it is not too pleasant for the skin of the face. I am thinking about sewing the case out of the softer fabric, but it could be a little complicated because of the odd shape and the length of the pillow.3. The price. It has been mentioned before, that the pillow itself is very simple made, so I guess it's the idea that costs that much.All these items could probably be improved by the manufacturer so the product really does make a perfect pregnancy product.
+1	What a great pillow.  My daughter used this for the last several months of her pregnancy.  After the baby arrived, she still uses it to prop them both up for breastfeeding.  Very versatile.  She says she couldn't have gotten through the last few months of pregnancy without this!  Excellent quality and design.
+1	Buy this one as soon as you find out your pregnant. I waited and had a few weeks of no good sleep, wing up several times from pressure on my belly. Slept with it for 2 night no and am 4 months pregnant. Just loooove it. The only problem now is that I don't want to get out of my bed in the morning, because it's almost too comfortable.
+1	About 5 months into my pregnancy I was really having trouble getting comfortable at night.  Regular pillows as barriers, did not work well. I looked into several pillows and purchased this one because it was a total body pillow.  It's been so nice because I can put it behind me and between my legs, which keeps me from rolling on my back (I'm 5'2", and feel like I have more pillow than I need, which tells me it would work for a taller person).**I recommend purchasing a cover for this pillow**  I thought I would just use the white cover that it comes with, but found out I really needed a pillow case!  Still worth absolutely EVERY PENNY!!**Also, there was a paper included with the pillow that showed 8 different ways to use the pillow including nursing positions, which I found very helpful (because I won't need to purchase another pillow for nursing later).Update:-I did purchase a boppy pillow for nursing.  I found that for a chair or couch, this pillow is just too big and bulky.  It would probably be great if you are staying in bed to nurse, though.-We have a queen sized bed and I had enough room.-Still so glad I had this pillow during pregnancy!
+1	This is a great body pillow. What I wish I could change about it:- it would be nice if the ends were thicker or firmer. Perhaps I just like more head support.- it's expensive- it's bulky- pillow case RAH HULK SMASH RAAAHHHHHHHHSeriously, they need to make it with a zipper or something. Pregnancy hormones + maternity pillow case = someone's gonna pay.Otherwise, it's great.
+1	I was very hesitant to spend $53 on a pillow but once I decided to buy it, it has made all the difference!  I've now had it since last September and I still use it every day!  Once I found out I was pregnant, I tried to transition from a back/stomach sleeper to a side sleeper and I had a VERY hard time.  I couldn't get into a deep sleep at all.  With the snoogle, my head rests comfortably on the "C" end and I put the "J" end between my legs.  My hands usually end up hugging the pillow and I switch off on sleeping on my right and left sides.  Since I use it every day, it has gotten flatter over time, but it still works and I start my 39th week tomorrow!  My only critique is that its difficult to turn from side to side during the night.  Still, it has been the best financial investment during my pregnancy!
+1	This pillow is awesome, super comfy!!! It helped me (a lot) to sleep during pregnancy and I still use it!
+1	One disclaimer--if you're used to sleeping with a feather pillow and down comforter, and you don't buy a different cover for your Snoogle, you're going to overheat in short order.  It's stuffed with polyester, which is fine--it holds its shape well and supports you--but by itself with this cover, it becomes waaay too hot.  That said, I love the shape and the support the pillow gives.  I've only had it for 2 nights, and the first night (without a separately purchased jersey cover) was hot, but with the new cover, I can already tell I'm waking up and flopping around the bed less.The also-pregnant friend who recommended the Snoogle to me said her dad got one and likes it for his back trouble, too.  I may have to recommend it to all the poor sleepers in my life.So, Snoogle with original cover:  4 stars.Snoogle with jersey cover:  5 stars.
-1	My friend lent me her Snoogle for my pregnancy, swearing it was the most comfortable thing she'd ever experienced.  I loved it for the first night or so, but then found myself getting repeatedly tangled up in it and unable to maintain the adjustments I needed to sleep comfortably (since the entire pillow is connected, when you move one part, the rest wants to move with it).  I eventually curled it into an "O" shape and now have it against the wall behind the bed to prop myself up while I watch TV.  I also found that it was stuffed too full to give my belly the under-support that it needed.Now I'm using a belly wedge and a regular flat, rectangular body pillow, as well as a couple of other supplementary pillows where I need them.  A million times better than this un-tameable monster.  Thanks, but no thanks on this one.
+1	During my first pregnancy, I used a Boppy pillow because it was smaller and took up less room in my bed.  That pillow worked ok but for my second pregnancy I wanted something that would support me better.  I researched this pillow and was very impressed by how comfortable it was.  I bought this during my 4th month and I was able to sleep restfully each night!  I was very impressed.  The reason I am giving this four stars is because into my 8th month I thought it was getting a little flat and I did not feel it held up as well as it should of - after only using it for four months.  Of course, by this time in my pregnancy I was uncomfortable a lot (not just when I was sleeping) so this may be a factor too. I still did not sleep without it!  As far as the size - it is bigger especially since I was used to a Bobby sleep pillow which was half the size but I am 5' 8" and and the length of it worked for me!
+1	I could not get through my pregnancy without this pillow.  I initially bought the larger, U-shaped pillow but this one worked better at keeping me from rolling over onto my back .  It is a pain to put the cover on after washing it, but that wouldn't stop me from buying this product again.  I might even keep using it after the baby is born!
+1	Last pregnancy I ordered the &#34;Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow&#34; (http://www.amazon.com/Leachco-Belly-Contoured-Pillow-Ivory/dp/B0002E7DIQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1390183256&sr;=1-2) since I thought having a symmetrical pillow would be easier. It was pretty comfortable, but even on my king size bed, it took up a ton of room. It was hot, and I felt like there was this giant divider between me and my husband. I also felt like the top of it dug into my shoulder - and I was never quite sure where to put my bottom arm (I'm a terrible side sleeper. Hence the need for the pillow.) It also seemed to lose &#34;fluff&#34; by the end of a few months.This time I decided to go with the &#34;Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow&#34; - and I'm hooked! I haven't used it long enough to see how the &#34;fluff factor&#34; works out, but my concerns about not having a &#34;symmetrical pillow&#34; have been alleviated. It's super easy to use, intuitive, and takes up so much less space. I love the support, it's isn't hot like the other pillow - and it allows me to snuggle with my husband if he's on the right side - and added perk!I feel way less 'isolated' in bed with this pillow. Would definitely recommend.
+1	after purchasing this pillow, sleeping on my side became so much easier because it is so supportive. my back pain was completely alleviated after i started using the snoogle. it takes up a lot of space in the bed, but that is a minor drawback considering how comfortable this pillow is. worth every cent spent on it!
-1	I purchased this pillow early on in my pregnancy, and it worked well for the first few months.  However, I found that the pillow really flattened out with use, and I eventually just switched to using multiple regular pillows in order to get enough support.  I am not a large person either (115 pounds before pregnancy), so it didn't take much.  Once I made that switch to regular pillows, I found the multiple pillows were much easier to maneuver around.  Now that I am in the final weeks and turning is really difficult, I would not go back to the snoogle at all.
+1	I was pretty skeptical just looking at the item before my purchase.  Sure the model looks comfortable in her position but she's being paid!  I was not a side sleeper before pregnancy and wasn't getting good sleep since the beginning of the pregnancy.  Around week 18, I gave up and forked out $50 for this stupid looking pillow.  When I sleep on my side without the snoogle, the arm that is underneath gets trapped and the circulation cuts off and wakes me up in the middle of the night.  Since getting the snoogle, I never have this problem.  Granted I wake up in the middle of the night to switch positions (or pee) but since my arm doesn't fall asleep, I wake up less frequently.  I like sleeping with hugging the long side more so than the open side as initially pictured.  I read some people complaining about the cover, don't expect a high threadcount and you'll be fine.
+1	I have been sleeping with this thing for since I was 9 weeks pregnant. Super comfy and since I am a side sleeper it supports my legs nicely. VERY good purchase!
+1	This pillow saved me! Well, honestly, I don't know anything different bc it was my first and only pregnancy... but I used it every night... you can survive without it... I did on vacation. But it was the best! I tended to have the long part behind me and I'd sort of halfway lean against it and I'd  have it between my legs... and under my head... AND I used a regular pillow for my head and a regular pillow under the stomach, which made it so I could lean back on the prego pillow. I am a side sleeper, but I also like to sleep on my back. So this pillow made that sort of possible. I wasn't on my back, but I was at least leaning against something so was better than nothing! You get tired of sleeping on your left side!!! Oh, also... when I was really far along, I started sleeping with it under my hip versus between my legs... that was when my hips hurt and I wanted to sleep on my back so bad to get the pressure off but you cant!
+1	My &#34;baby&#34; is now 14 months and yet, the pillow has never left my bed. I love that it's the only pillow that I did. One for my head, one to hold and on between my legs --- this does it all. Not pregnant, I used to wake up with pain in my lower back and legs. I have dealt with slipped discs, sciatic nerve pain and general back pain. While it's not totally perfect, this pillow relieves the majority of that.What I don't like about it is that the pillow case is difficult. You can't wash the pillow itself, but the case isn't too terrible to get off; it's getting it back on that's time consuming.I also think that $50 for a pillow is steep. But then again, you'll never buy another pillow, so the jury is out on that for me.
+1	I began using this very early on in pregnancy. I don't think I could sleep without it. The only thing I would change is the &#34;head part.&#34; I wish it were as big as the lower part.
+1	bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months pregnant.  She loves it and uses it every night to help with her back pain and the pressure of her growing belly. Highly recommend.
+1	I was pessimistic about buying this body pillow at first after seeing some reviews online with mixed reviews.  I originally attempted to stack and position my own pillows in our King size bed but found that it was always such a hassle if I shifted positions, went to the restroom or wanted to change sides that I was sleeping on.  I was also concerned about the pillow cover that some people had complained was difficult to put on (see my Organic Snoogle Pillow cover review).When I received my Snoogle and took it out of the packaging, I was afraid that it was going to take up a lot of our bed.  It worked out just fine and actually took up less space that my regular pillows which I had been piling.  I actually bought the Snoogle when I was about 18 weeks pregnant since it was suggested that I start sleeping on my side.Now having used it for a bit of time (currently 21 weeks) and having the tummy stick out, I'm really find the Snoogle really helps me keep my position.  The great thing is that I can also use it for other things like reading and also feeding the baby later on.  It comes with an insert that shows different ways you can use the Snoogle.My favorite way to sleep with the Snoogle is either on my left side or right side.  It cradles my back perfectly when I sleep on my left hand side.  Sometimes when I unknowingly roll back towards a flat position from sleeping on the left side, the support from the Snoogle keeps me still somewhat diagonal without being completely flat.As some reviewers have mentioned, they said that the Snoogle gets flat over time and that they wished it was more 'poufy'. I haven't found any issues with that and have found it to be adequate in height.  Although I'm not the type that sleeps with many pillows under my head.The Snoogle did come with a very basic cover that is removable for washing however I did opt to buy the Organic cover as well.
+1	Being very pregnant, I know I am supposed to sleep on my side. But I simply cannot do it on my own and always wake up flat on my back. This pillow kept me on my side for probably 70% of the time (just a rough estimate based on how I find myself when I wake up). I am thankful for that.
+1	This pillow was a great sleeping aid for the prego. Its still gets used for a body pillow. Its also great on the couch, lol!
+1	I got this pillow early in my 2nd trimester and love it!  It's great for side sleeping and back support while sitting up in bed.  I followed other reviewers' advice and air dried the cover then had my husband put it on.**update** I was inspired by my chiropractor office where they have belly pillows so you can lie on your stomach so one night when I had an extremely achy back around 28 weeks, I made a donut with this pillow and gently laid down.... Amazing!  First time I'd been able to "lie" on my stomach in bed.  My amazing hubby proceeded to give me a back rub :)
+1	I used this throughout my pregnancy, and in those final days when you are so big and your belly is so heavy . . . you can careless how big and this darn thing is! My husband named it "Leroy" because it often was like having a 3rd person in the bed . . . but it saved my back and hips.It was a wonderful present to receive in the beginning of my pregnancy and I recommend it to anyone who wants to congratulate a friend, daughter or sister, etc.The only thing I found which was untrue was using it to nurse after, it is way to long for that. I tried wrapping around me and then I was pushed forward and I was uncomfy, but the baby was fine ;-) I just passed it on to a non-preggo cousin that has back problems.
+1	This pillow is great! Used it thought pregnancy and now to nurse and even sleep. So comfortable and durable, keeps its shape. Would recommend or get for any friend who is pregnant.
+1	I am over 7 months pregnant and have owned this for about three weeks now........what a relief!  I thought using just a standard body pillow was going to be good enough.  Nope!  The only &#34;downer&#34; about the pillow is its awkward size and length.....but that's only when its NOT in use.  Otherwise, its been helpful.  My husband even enjoys hugging onto it when I get up before him.  I highly recommend this pillow if you're having any difficulty getting comfortable.  Its even wonderful for sitting propped up when you're having difficulty with everything pushing up into your diaphragm.  Buy it!!
+1	A friend recommended the Snoogle when I asked her about "must haves" during and after pregnancy.  At first I was a little skeptical, especially because it's pretty expensive for a pillow.  I'm so glad that I purchased this!  I'm 22 weeks along and was trying to use regular pillows as props to provide some support and also to prevent me from flipping over onto my stomach at all.  I typically use the Snoogle under my head with no additional pillows, have the long side in front to support my belly and then I may or may not use the bottom curve between my kneees.  If I need to roll over I can still use the pillow under my head and between my knees so I don't have to constantly flip it over as I roll.  I'm 5'8" and I fit very comfortably.  It's also been great to use as a prop in bed when I'm reading or watching TV.  Definitely be aware that this is a large pillow.  I cuddle so close to it that it hasn't been an issue in our queen size bed but it may not work for everyone.  All in all, I'm thrilled that I bought it and wonder if I'll want to give it up even after the baby is born.
-1	I don't have anything to add...it's very uncomfortable and didn't ease any of my discomfort. I used it for one night.
+1	I am currently six months pregnant and have been using this every night for the past month.  I love how I can use it several different ways to provide the comfort I need during my pregnancy.  I use it prop myself up at night when I have bad acid reflux, other nights I use it for back support and to have something between my legs to help prevent leg cramps.  I recommend this to any pregnant woman out there looking for a better night sleep!
+1	I bought this pillow when I was 3 months pregnant with twins. I was already a side sleeper so that helps. I tried it the way it shows in the picture but after 2 hours my hips were killing me(I have bad hips to begin with). I then switched sides to where I was hugging it and that is the most comfortable position for me by far. I love the other positions too. It is very comfortable and I would definitely recommend this to any pregnant woman. My husband even uses it sometimes when he thinks I am not looking. I know this pillow will get many more years out of it since I will most likely still use it after my twins are born.
+1	Sleeping while pregnant is not an easy or comfortable task.  This pillow makes a world of difference.  It is flexible enough to fold into a variety of positions and has turned our bed into a recliner.  I am not sure what I would have done for the last several months without it!
+1	I love my body pillow.  I got it when I was about 3 months pregnant.  I didn't start using it nightly until I was about 4-5 months along.  It was a little stiff at first.  However, once it was broken it, it was great!  I use it every night!  My husband loves it as well!  He often says that he may buy his own!  It's a great pillow!(I also bought the cover for it.  The cover is pricey, but worth it.)
+1	More comfy than my Boppy body pillow from 1st pregnancy, but still not the amazing pillow I hoped for. (to be fair, there may not be such a pillow).  Still, a necessity for second half of pregnancy.  I like that it has a removable, washable cover.  Would recommend to a friend, and definitely would recommend over Boppy.
-1	I purchased this pillow and have never successfully slept through an entire night with it. It is really quite large and feels confining when wrapped all around you under the sheets. I felt like I couldn't move and couldn't get comfortable. Plus, the material is really scratchy and awful - forcing you to shell out additional money for a cover. Way over-priced. Mine sits in the corner of my bedroom. For $20 I bought a body pillow and ultra soft cover at Target and I love it and sleep with it every night. Save your money!
+1	This pillow has been a life saver throughout my pregnancy.  It helps to keep you sleeping on your side and supports your hips, belly and head.  I sometimes even catch my husband using it!
-1	I did not find this item to be very comfortable at all!  Maybe I am too petite for this item but it was not very plyable at all and became far too cumbersome.  It just took up a great deal of space in the bed and was too hard and thick to use under my head.  Furthermore, it did not supply enough back support so I prefered to use a heatable neck pillow to support my back.  Honestly, you would be better served to purchase a bolster pillow for between your knees and a heatable (chamomile or lavender) beanbag pillow.  Spend the fifty dollars on your baby instead!
+1	I used this the entire time I was pregnant. It worked really well and gave me a lot of support on my back. One bad thing I didn't realize is that it doesn't come with a cover. So there was no way to wash it if it got dirty since it's too big for the washing machine. Also, it ripped at the end within the first month. I didn't bother to repair it and it didn't rip more.
+1	I got the snoogle when i was 4 months pregnant. I'm now 8 months pregnant and it has served me well for 4 months! I LOVE this pillow. It serves so many functions. I use it every single night to prop me up as I read in bed (you just fold it into a little ball or "nest" as they call it), and when I sleep, I lay on my left side with the snoogle under my large belly supporting it all through the night. I honestly don't move until I have to get up and go use the bathroom. Then I come back and get comfortable in a different position (facing the snoogle hugging it). It's so versatile and if I get sore hips, I just roll over onto the snoogle under my back and it takes pressure off my hips.I should also mention that since the age of 13, I've had a herniated disc in my lower back. Well, thanks to this pillow, I haven't had any problems with my lower back at ALL in this pregnancy. If you want to sleep through the night comfortably, I would recommend this pillow.The only negative thing I could think of to say is that sometimes it's difficult if I decide I want to roll over onto my other side. You have to shift and finagle your way around the snoogle. But other than that, it's been fantastic. I fully plan on taking the snoogle with me to the hospital!
+1	I felt like I stopped sleeping basically as soon as I got pregnant. I'm 16 weeks now, no aches and pains or big belly but somehow being pregnant made me an insomniac.  I have had this pillow for over a week. Haven't tried all the ways you can prop it up yet, but I am sleeping way better now with it.  If I don't have to run to the potty in the night I am now sleeping all the way through the night on this very comfortable pillow. I am hoping it stays useful after my pregnancy. Some reviewers mentioned a hard stitch in the pillow that sticks out. That is true, but most of the time I don't feel it. I haven't ordered the cover yet but probably will.
+1	The Snoogle is a very cuddly and comfortable pillow for the legs and belly. It was nice that it came with cover.
+1	Pros: felt soo much better sleeping with this than just stacks of random pillows.Cons:1) we had a full/queen bed and between myself and this pillow my poor husband had virtually no space. he was a trooper though and never complained!2) By the end of my pregnancy I felt that I had flattened the head portion to the point it wasn't helping very much. For this it gets 4 stars. It is promoted to be more firm of a pillow than the Boppy or other competing brands. It started out that way for sure but I smothered it to death, and now it is limp. For a lot of people they may not feel this way or be as picky as me but I LOVE extra firm pillows. So if you are like me you may keep this in mind.3) Removing the case and washing it is a giant pain in the behind. That was a battle I was determined to win because clean linens are my happy place.All in all, it was still worth the purchase and gave me MANY good nights sleep. Just be aware, it may not last to your firm standards or leave space for your partner in the bed. I would buy it again, and just might have to with another pregnancy to keep the firmness I prefer.
-1	When I first bought Snoogle, I loved it, as it was perfectly supportive as promised. Then my toddler barfed in our bed, and some of it unfortunately splashed on Snoogle. Snoogle's cover had to be washed. Snoogle's cover is very snug, without a hint of stretch. Snoogle's ONE cover opening is in a very awkward location. I was so frustrated with trying to put Snoogle's cover back on after washing that I left it off and left the pillow bare. Big mistake. Snoogle's supportive secret is in its cover because when left without, it's basically a flat blob of cheap batting that stores body heat like an extra-lumpy camel and then spits it back at you during the night. Why do people devise ways to frustrate pregnant women? Finally, today, I put Snoogle's cover back on, and after a half-hour of twisting, writhing, cursing and taking two breaks ... I got the stupid cover back on but didn't even have a post-coital glow as an added benefit.My recommendation? Buy a straight but fairly flexible body pillow. It's what I had for my first pregnancy. We simply used two king cases to cover it, and I had no problem curving it to fit between my knees as needed.
+1	This pillow is wonderful. There are a number of ways to manipulate it to support whatever part of you happens to be aching that day. I use it to support my back, belly and neck mostly. It can be a bit cumbersome, but instead of trying to get out of the pillows grasp, I remove the pillow from the bed instead.I am only 5'2&#34; and there is quite a bit of extra pillow -but I just wrap it farther around my body and it's very comfortable!Tag reads that it meets California's flame retardant standards but even brand new, right out of the package, there was no toxic smell.
+1	I was experiencing shoulder pain from sleeping on my left side, as is recommended for pregnant women during their 2nd trimester. My hips were having a hard time of it as well. This pillow really helped a lot. The only thing that happens sometimes, is my left knee begins to ache - I put another smaller pillow underneath and that does wonders. I also purchased a wedge for my tummy - I look like a cocoon of pillows! It really helps me stay on my side - before I would wake up kinda dizzy and find myself on my back - this helps. I've had it for a month or so and it retains its shape. The only complaint I have is the pillow cover is HOT - I wish it were made of 100% cotton. I found a replacement cover made by the company that is 100% cotton and it cost $30! I thought that was kind of rip.. bringing the cost of pillow to a whopping $80? ... but I'm most likely going to splurge and get it, because being pregnant and super hot at night is not comfy. I still love this pillow though. :)
+1	I was worried about buying this pillow as I have heard it's on the large side.  When I took it out of the box I was surprised at how large it was, but it doesn't take up a lot of space on our queen size bed with me laying with it. I am finding I fall asleep much faster with the pillow than I did without it.  I love being able to lean slightly so it feels like I'm laying on my back while I'm still mostly on my side.  It has take some of the pressure off of my hips while I sleep.  I love laying facing the long part of the pillow and away from it.  I have even caught my husband using it when I'm not! I can't wait to get the pillow broken in just a little more.  I look forward to using it with the different layouts they gave with the pillow!
+1	I bought this pillow when my pregnant back started aching at around 14 weeks.  I have used it every day since then!!! I love cuddling with it and now that I am about to give birth I find the pillow that much more supportive! I highly recommend.  I also recommend you get some kind of pillow case for it as it comes with a cover, but it is extremely difficult to take off and put back on when you decide to wash it.
+1	Love the body pillow, just wish the case would be easier to put on. I am very pleased with my purchase!
+1	If you are on the fence wondering if it's worth it to spend the money... just buy it. Seriously. A good night's sleep is worth it.Pros:So comfortableStays between knees no matter which side you're facingCons:The cover is a serious pain to put on - even without drying itThe Jersey zip cover wasn't any easierHard to get out of bed while pregnant when the long side is along the edge of the bedMy husband got jealous hahaBecause the cover is so much of a pain to put on, I would use a regular rectangle pillow case cover and put it over the side where my face touched so that I could wash it more frequently.
-1	I have had this pillow for only a few months now. I got it at the beginning of my 2nd trimester, and now I'm nearing the beginning of my 3rd trimester.  Within that time, the stuffing inside of the bottom part of the pillow has thinned out, making my legs too close together.  I need more spacing between my knees so that my hips don't hurt when I sleep.  Painful hips from sleeping on your side is SO annoying, if you haven't experienced it already, you just might if you are using this pillow.  In addition to this, the head part of the pillow is too flat.  I struggle with sleeping on this as a pillow because my neck hurts.  Overall I do not recommend this product.  I read tons of reviews on Amazon of different pillows, and this one was the cheapest with the best review.  Don't fall for the same trap I did!!! Shell out the extra bucks and get a better quality, better stuffed pillow.... you'll be happier sleeping if you do.
+1	All I can say is that I would not have made it through my pregnancy without this pillow. Very early on in my pregnancy, my hips and back started hurting me during sleep. I bought this pillow pretty early on and it fixed those problems. I literally could not sleep without this pillow. When we went out of town for the weekend, I brought it with me. It's versatile: you can fold it into different shapes for various needs. It can help prop you up if you're having a particularly bad reflux night, you can use it under your legs for elevation after a long day at work, or the traditional flat shape to help you sleep at night.My husband also loved it. Every time I would get up to use the bathroom or get something, I would come back and he would be curled up in my snoogle!
-1	We have a king size bed and this thing is like sleeping with a third person.  It takes up so much room and it too cumbersome to move around especially when you are dealing with a baby belly. It is impossible to put the pillow case it comes with back on it if you need to wash it.  I wish I had bought a smaller one with a case that zipped.
+1	I had a love-hate relationship with this pillow throughout my pregnancy.  I hated sleeping on my side, and I unfairly blamed a lot of it on the pillow, but the pillow wasn't to blame.  It is large and took up most of our queen size bed, but really came in handy, especially toward the end of my pregnancy.  Also, the cover is zippered and washable, but a pain to take off and put back on.
+1	I bought this pillow after trying out several different brands and styles in the big-box baby store.  The Snoogle, although slightly more expensive than the other brand, seemed to have a better quality and design.  I am small-framed and did not want a large, bulky pillow.  The Snoogle seemed perfect.  After one night sleeping with the pillow I am hooked.  There are multiple sleeping positions with the pillow - you can use it to cradle your back or your belly.  I love the versatility and that if I roll over I can just cradle it the opposite way.  I can't believe I waited until 21 weeks to get this Snoogle!The Snoogle is about $20 less on Amazon than the big-box baby store, so try it out in the store and then order it online.  The price difference means you can order the pillow and a replacement cover for the same price as you would pay for the pillow alone in the store.  It does come with a thin cotton cover but it is not the prettiest or the softest.  I will be looking for another cover soon.I couldn't be happier with the Snoogle - even paying full price for it!
+1	I was shocked when my wife could suddenly sleep through a night of her pregnancy with this thing.  Thank god.  If mama aint happy, aint nobody happy.
+1	I really liked this pillow. It was super comfortable early on in my pregnancy. Now that I am 31 weeks and quite a bit bigger, the pillow is kind of a pain to get out of...it really does a good job of wrapping around you, so much so that you struggle getting out of it. I still like it, and I would still recommend it, but I don't think it is an idea pillow after 25 weeks or so.
-1	I checked the online reviews of this product before spending the money on it. I was having difficulty getting comfortable and sleeping at night so I decided to try the Snoogle. I have since returned the Snoogle. I felt I could not get the pillow in position to be comfortable. The top curve was in the way of my regular pillow and the bottom curve was never in the right spot if I had the long part of the pillow up against me. I also felt that the pillow did not support my belly very well because it is so thick-I felt uncomfortable with it under me. I prefer the regular body pillows and find much more comfort using them-for a lot less money.
+1	I thought it was too indulgent to buy a pillow during pregnancy and had read that regular body pillows are just fine. Well ... after a few friends had this one, I bought it on Amazon and I am so glad I did!! Not only is it the ONLY pillow I sleep with now (to my husband's delight, because he gets all the bed pillows now), but I also use it to sit up in bed and wrap around me. Sitting up with one end wrapped under my legs and one end wrapped around my belly makes for a super comfortable &#34;bed chair&#34; or something like that! I absolutely love it. I registered for an additional slipcover too.
-1	I am so much trouble getting into a restful sleep position at 6 months...I loved the idea of this pillow & the good reviews. I am 5'6" & 130 pounds. I have a large belly, yet I am small in size. I am normally a side sleeper.The shape of this pillow did not fit my body correctly(because of the pre-shaped curves) If you put the head curve under your head your arm will fall asleep & I normally sleep with my arm under my head, so I don't get it. My belly was not supported & I still woke up with back pain.It takes up way too much room in a queen size bed, pushing dad 2 be almost to the floor! I still found myself wanting to flip & could not do so without constantly waking my husband.I think this pillow may work for some, yet not for me. I will just stick with multi-pillow props.
+1	I couldn't imagine sleeping while pregnant without the snoogle! I even recommend it to others with back problems (men and women.) I don't think my husband as as crazy about it, it is pretty bulky. Now that I'm nearly through my second pregnancy, this is starting to get pretty squashed and I'm back to using additional pillows as well. I really wish that the cover was a nicer fabric and easier to clean.All in all though, it is a genius product that really meets the needs of pregnant women! (And I would argue it is a good ergonomic pillow for those with back problems.)
+1	Initially, the upper curve was rather thick & firm, and too high for my neck - I'd wake up achy or with a stiff neck. But the rest of the pillow worked so well for me I stuck with it, and after maybe 3-4 weeks, the head part softened to where it is now comfortable most of the time.As another reviewer mentioned also happens to her, I sometimes wake up on my back, very comfortably cradled by snoogle, the one curve under my head and the other behind my knees. But the thing is - pregnant women aren't supposed to sleep on their backs b/c it can restrict oxygen and nutrient flow to the fetus. I don't want to be comfortable on my back!! This isn't the pillow's fault, I do get that, but one reason I bought it was to keep me on my side, so I wanted to pass this along to anyone else who might be considering it for this reason. It helps, but it doesn't prevent back-sleeping.Pros: (1) one pillow to maneuver; firm but soft enough to be comfortable; (2) it's a good size for me (now that the neck area has softened) @ 5'4" and 143 pre-preg weight; (3) while not percale, the pillowcase feels fine to me, tho I do also plan to make a second cover out of a softer knit jersey; (4) while my sleep is still broken up, I'm able to get longer stretches with snoogle than I was when using regular pillows; (5) there is less room in the bed, but I can still fit myself & snoogle onto my half of our queen-size mattress.Con: (1) the price (it's just basic pillow filling, not down or gel or anything fancy; polyfil costs a couple bucks a bag so I really think they are making $30+ profit per pillow); (2) the cover is hard to take off and put on; velcro, buttons, or a zipper would have been a much better approach; (3) maneuvering it under the blankets in winter is tricksy - I have to throw back the blankets, lift up the pillow, move my body, then put the pillow back. Often I (inadvertently, I swear!) smack my husband in the head with the upper curve while trying to extricate the lower curve from the sheets. Gets old quick, esp as I'm up 4-8x/night; and (4) when it's in the middle of the bed, my husband tends to hug it as a body pillow, further complicating this extrication/flipping process. Again, not the pillow's fault, but amusing.
+1	I was having some lower back pain early in my second trimester and the snoogle proved a good cure.  For me it was a wise investment, though many women could get similar results sleeping with a regular pillow between their knees.Some other reviewers complained that the snoogle had a rough exterior, but I found the cover (which is included with this model) to be smooth with a texture much like a decent pillowcase (without the cover, yes the snoogle is rough).  I also found the stuffing inside the snoogle to be quite sufficient - enough to provide some support, but not so much that the body pillow felt hard.As a petite woman (5'2") I worried before my pillow arrived that I might need a smaller mini-snoogle, but again I found this (the regular size) to work just fine.  Yes, this is a large pillow that will take up bed space, but in a queen there's plenty of room for a snoogle, two normal-size people, and even a couple cats.  All-in-all I found snoogle to be a good product and a wise investment.
+1	I think this pillow is a must for any pregnant woman who struggles with sleep at night. It helps support your back and hips.  It is however really large and it took me a few nights to learn how to sleep with it (almost like there is a technique to it).  But once I figured it out, my sleeps have been as good as they're going to get while being pregnant.  I sleep comfortably with this pillow.  My only disappoint is that I wish they made a cover for it so that I can wash it.
+1	I'm 17 weeks pregnant and have been using this pillow for about 2 weeks after a body pillow wouldn't keep me on my side.  I love this thing, I wake up in the same position I fall asleep in, so I know I'm not rolling onto my back.  It's not too bulky either.  I'm 5'7'' and my husband is 6'3'' and we still have enough room in our queen bed.The only slight drawback is that it does such a good job of keeping me from moving that I wake up when I need to roll over because my hip or shoulder hurt.  But it's worth it to know I'm staying on my side.Almost a year later and I wish I could give this more stars!!  I loved it all through pregnancy - it kept me comfortable when I got huge and I was so very glad to be able to sleep.  I'm updating because my husband is sleeping on it now after hurting his back today.  He was finally able to get comfortable after I pulled my giant pillow out of the closet.
-1	This pillow sounded like the best thing in the world. I got it out to try it and immediately found that I was too tall for this pillow, unless I slept in a curled position (I am 6ft tall). You have to use the dedicated head part for this which seemed like a rock and the material was not soft. For the money this should have been the best thing ever. I was so bummed, I really thought this was going to be great. So I went and found a 10 dollar body pillow and a 10 soft cover. I also get to use my own head pillows. Wish I could have gave this a better review!
+1	At 7 months pregnant my back was killing me. I bought this based on the reviews and I'm so glad I did. After the first night I noticed a huge difference and after a few more days, my back pain was gone. I gave birth back in January and I still use it---it's just that comfortable. I also like that you can use it in other positions (it shows you on the package). I've had it for 8 months now and it's a little bit flatter than I'd like but still does the job. Fully recommend to all preggos suffering from back pain. I just wish I'd had bought it earlier on!
+1	This is a very comfortable sleep aid, especially for the third trimester. The fact that you can use it in several positions, including for sitting up in bed is the best.The only negative issue is the cover, which is very cheap. I recommend buying a replacement cover.
+1	My mother bought me this to help me sleep during my pregnancy. This is my first pregnancy so very quickly I found it hard to sleep on my sides 100% of the night... I usually flop between each side or end up on my back.I am not that far along right now so its hard to sleep with the pillow. I know it will be a lot better when I can rest my belly on it once I am bigger. but for now since I am still able to roll on my back i find myself in akward positions on the pillow and waking up with a sore shoulder.the cover is very itchy and you are going to want to take it off and wash it in some hot water with fabric softener to get that scratchy feeling out of it. And be patient when trying to shove the pillow back into the cover.The other plus is my cats totally love it! It is big though, so if you are sharing a small bed with someone it will be an adjustment. Luckilly we have a nice king size bed so there's room for the pillow and everyone else.
+1	I do like how thoughtful the makers of this product are. The curves are perfect for my arms and legs to wrap around and I am a side sleeper. I also developed a lot of back pain during pregnancy which stuck around afterwards and got worse with my second pregnancy. This pillow helps me sleep better which is so important with two little ones to keep up with. The pillow itself isn't the most firm which is what made this product a 4 instead of a 5 in my book. Washing the pillow cover also sucks but it's still worth it for the many comfy positions I could use.If you're looking for more tips on the best baby products out there, visit the websit AllMomsArePerfect.com.

+1	I didn't want to buy a lot of one time use pregnancy specific stuff  but my sister-in-law recommended this so I decided to splurge, plus the seven pillows it took for me to get comfortable was getting out of hand. My advice is to buy it as soon as possible! It can be utilized in tons of different ways and I found myself finding new ways to use it as my pregnancy progressed. I've used it for sleeping (obviously), lounging, reading, sitting, nursing, laying down on my stomach and numerous other ways. I credit it alone with helping me sleep through the night for as long as my pregnancy bladder would allow. When I wasnt using it, my husband loved it and noticed a big difference in back pain. It has travelled all over with us and made hotel beds and car rides bearable, even at 41 weeks along. It does take some getting used to and can seem like a cumbersome pain initially but then one morning you wake up feeling incredible and not even realizing that you fell asleep and you're in love. Baby is three months old now and this is still in our bed and being used.
+1	I love this pillow. I am 5 months pregnancy and this is helping me with my lower back pain.
-1	No problems with the quality of the pillow or the pillow case.I haven't tried any other body pillows, so I can't compare, but it seems to help. Early in my first trimester, I started getting severe knee and hip pain at night. I still have some, but sleeping with the body pillow seems to help. I think the important thing in avoiding the hip pain is to keep my whole upper leg on the body pillow, so it isn't angling downward - at least I hope this will help.The pillow comes with a pillow case. Its a bit hard to get it on and off for washing, but I'm not sure how it could be improved -  it's a snake shaped pillow - a zipper or snaps would make it easier to get on and off, but would probably be uncomfortable or wouldn't completely cover the pillow.Edit: I liked this pillow at first, but before the end of the second trimester it was very flat. Washing it didn't plump it up enough. I ended up using two normal pillows as body pillows - one between my knees and one to hug. Save your money
+1	I bought this pillow when I was 16 weeks pregnant because I was having a hard time getting comfortable at night. I loved it from day one and was always finding new ways to arrange it in order to get comfortable at night. I did not use it all the time but as my body changed throughout my pregnancy I would drag it back out and use it for as long as I needed it. There are an infinate number of positions you can use it in and I would encourage any user to experiment in order to get the support they need. I even took it to the hospital with me to use during the postpartum period. My husband loves it too and uses it any time that I don't.One of the best (and most long lasting uses) is for breastfeeding. I keep it on the couch and simply wrap it around my waist on which ever side I am going to feed on. I have a Boppy and a Breast Friend but this seems to be my favorite nursing pillow because I dont have to put the baby down to get it into position. I simply grab a free end and wrap it around either the front of me or the back, depending on how I am sitting. My son is only 2 1/2 months old and weighs 16 lbs so having this pillow be so large and supportive is a huge plus. It's even great for his occasional bottle feedings and also for times when we are just relaxing in bed and I need somewhere to prop him up on. He seems so comfy when laying against it.All in all, it was well worth the money it cost. You don't even have to invest in a pillow case for it if you dont want to because it comes with a removable, washable cover. I would def buy it again!
+1	I already had a pregnancy pillow for between my knees, but I saw this online and had to get it! It is the most comfortable thing I've ever laid on in my life!! The pillow provides EXCELLENT support for your whole body and even curls around your neck so that you have a head-pillow. It's great! I can tell I'll be using this pillow long after I'm done with my pregnancy. I highly recommend this pillow to all pregnant women....and non-pregnant women, as well! My fiance and daughter even love it!!
+1	I had this pillow for when I was pregnant and I loved it. It was necessary to sleep with - to the point that I would take it with me when we weren't at home and I was pregnant. I used it from probably about Week 24 or so till the end, maybe a little earlier. I bought this as a gift for a pregnant friend and she loves it too. It supports you where you need to be supported and helps you actually get comfortable - better than anything else out there.
+1	I recently got this pillow and I cannot tell you how wonderful it is! I can finally sleep! I'm 18 weeks, and I've been using 4-5 pillows a night to try and get comfortable. I haven't been able to fall asleep on my left side like is recommended; I've been sleeping sitting up and after the first bathroom wake-up I could sleep on my side. With this I was comfortable instantly and fell right asleep. I aslo fell back asleep after getting up to use the restroom right away (which is new!) It is incredibly comfortable, and easy to move around with if you like to flip over. It also comes with a sheet that shows you tons of different ways to use it (more than is shown online!) I adore it!!! Worth every penny! **I'd like to add, now that my daughter is 7 months old, that I adored that pillow all through my pregnancy, it was a God-send!
+1	Got it for my wife who is a side sleeper and was having a hard time sleeping due to pregnant tummy. She is very happy with this pillow and says it provides plenty of support.
+1	I really like the Snoogle. I got it when I was around 5 months and starting to get uncomfortable at night. Now I'm almost 7 months and it definitely provides the support I need. Plus it's a nice barrier to keep my husband from kicking me in the shins in his sleep, but that's another story. My only complaint is the cover is scratchy and hard to put back on after washing. I've been contemplating making my own slipcover for it so it will be more comfortable. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.Edit - I'm now 33 weeks and probably couldn't sleep without this thing. I may be sleeping a little too soundly because when I wake up and try to roll over or get up I can barely move. But at least I'm sleeping!
-1	I hated this pillow. Like most pregnant people it's extremely difficult to get comfortable for sleep and I was so excited when I read the reviews. I really really wanted to love this pillow but it just did not work for me. It made me feel claustrophobic and even more uncomfortable. I've discussed this with other moms and they either love it or hate it. There's no in between. I think this is way overpriced and I'm so glad I waited to buy the cover for it because I would have wasted even more money. And the cover costs almost as much as the pillow.
+1	I used this every night while I was pregnant.  My only complaint is the cover is a pain to get on and off to wash.
+1	I got this pillow when I was 3 months pregnant because I was trying to prevent myself from sleeping on my back.  Not only did the pillow help me avoid rolling onto my back, it also provides great support and comfort.  Now 6 months pregnant I still sleep amazingly well at night.  The pillow is great in all positions described/shown.  I have not noticed it to flatten out either, its holding up really well.
-1	I am petite - and this is way too big and fluffy for me. My dog loves it though....I curl it up like a cinnamon bun and my cocker spaniel climbs into the middle of it and snuggles in. He seems to be in heaven. For me...not so much. It is bulky and too thick. I imagined that as my pregnancy wore on and my belly grew that it would fit better. Not even. If it doesn't work for you the first time - it won't work better later. Some folks seem to love it though - so give it a try, but if you are like me and petite you may want to find a softer alternative. I use two king size down pillows that I can squish up to where I want them.
+1	My husband bought me this pillow as a gift when I was in my first trimester.  I had never even heard of a pregnancy pillow, but was pleased to discover how comfortable it was, even before I was showing.  I am now 25 weeks, and this thing is a lifesaver.  It provides so much support when I side-lie on my left, which isnt a natural position for me at night (I usually lay on my back and had trouble with the transition. The snoogle doesn't allow me to roll all the way over).  Plus as my belly gets bigger it provides wonderful support under it as well.  I sleep very well every night snuggled into this thing.  So well, in fact, that my husband grabs it as soon as I get up for work at 5am and sleeps with it until he has to get up! LOL. I've also found it is really cozy to wrap around me when I'm just sitting on the couch, and may also double well as a nursing pillow when the baby is born.  There are many different positions in which you can use it.  Great product.  Would recommend to anyone.
+1	I had a hard time choosing between the Bobby Pillow for moms - or this Snoogle!  I'm not sure how I would have felt about the Bobby - but I am in love with my Snoogle!!!  Its big.  It will take up a lot of room in the bed.. but its worth it for sleep!  I'm 19 weeks pregnant and sleep so much better since buying the Snoogle!!!  Don't wait to order it - you can benefit from it pretty early on!  Love love love!!!
-1	I have had back pain since the third month of my pregnancy and finally gave in to buying an expensive pregnancy pillow at month 6.  I thought this would be my godsend.  I used it for less than one night before I tossed it on the ground and slept without it.  Since I couldn't sleep, I actually got up out of bed to print out my return label because I couldn't wait to get rid of this thing and pop it off at UPS and get it out of our house.  I am absolutely baffled by all of the rave reviews.Pros:One star for being made in the USA (with foreign parts, so take that for what it's worth).Cons:Cheap fabric case.Inside filling feels flimsy and like it won't hold up.Completely UNCOMFORTABLE!!!You can't use your own pillow unless you want your head lifted up super high.It's not easy to switch from left side to right side.  You have to hoist the dumb thing back and forth (try doing that with sheets/duvet on top), and in doing so, it's completely disruptive to one's sleeping partner.  Also, even simple things like turning over in bed are difficult/painful whilst pregnant, and this pillow makes it even harder.I will either invest in a U-shaped pillow or non-pregnancy specific long tubular body pillow (so I can use my own pillow for my head and turn sides with ease) or just stick to having a regular pillow between my legs.  The Leacho Snoogle was a total bust and a complete waste of money.
+1	helped with aches and sleep trouble for 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  will definitely use in future pregnancies and recommend to anyone who has trouble getting comfortable.  slipcover is easy to remove and wash, but pretty hard to put back on.  worth the trouble though.
+1	I was hesitant in getting this pillow because of the price tag and simply because women have survived pregnancies without it. But at 25 weeks, I was getting really uncomfortable at night so I decided I'd try anything to help me get me more sleep.  I'd definitely recommend it, it's nice using one pillow instead of 4. I'm a back sleeper, so this helps keep me on my side and the part that goes behind your head is nice because it keeps the acid reflux down. The pillow case is not bad taking off, kind of a pain to slide back on. I don't think it's too soft. I like my pillow on the firm side and it's fine. (I'm about 5'2&#34; and 130 lbs (30 weeks), pre-pregnancy weight was 110).
+1	The first night in this pillow and I was converted. 7 mos pregnant and had one of those long body pillows that just wasn't cutting it. This is simpler, easier to get in and out of and so much more supportive!
+1	I cannot say that I sleep through every night still, but I absolutely love this pillow.  It truly helps me with my level of comfort when comfort decreases with every passing night.  I was nervous about spending this much money on a pillow, but it was worth every penny!!!
+1	I would use this while not pregnant!  It is considerably large but there is still room for husband in the bed.  Its easy to get comfortable.
-1	I'm so glad I'm not the one who paid $50 for this pillow! God bless my friend for thinking of me, but I wish her money could have been better spent. She said her daughter loved it, and maybe the Snoogle works well for some women, but after three attempts at using it, I stuffed it in a plastic bag, and there it sits on my bedroom floor to this day. Here are the reasons why:1. It's way too firm. I could not get it to support my tummy from underneath at all; all I could do was try to sort of lean against it, but that didn't offer any support. Same thing with the back "support" -- the whole pillow is so firm, it was more of a leaning thing than a support thing.2. Maybe this is more of the same firmness complaint, but I couldn't get used to using the pillow part. It wasn't soft enough to "mold" to my head and neck, and I ended up trying to push it far enough to the side that I could use a regular pillow instead.3. The fabric is, as others have said, not very good quality and itches if your bare skin touches it. The farther I've gone in my pregnancy, the more sensitive my skin has gotten; I can't even imagine trying to use it now. Assuming I could stand the pillow itself, I'd have to buy one of the covers (though I don't have one, so I'm not sure of their quality, either) or make one myself.4. The curve is too confining. I felt like I had to curl up all the time. I'm 5'6" tall, so you can use that as a measurement tool if you like. I just can't stand not being able to stretch out comfortably, and the Snoogle didn't allow me to do it.5. It's H-U-G-E!!! God help you if you're trying to share a less-than-kingsized bed with your spouse or significant other AND this gargantuan thing. There won't be room for the three of you.6. Don't even try to roll this thing over with you. Talk about a wrestling match!Maybe I can recycle the Snoogle into a sort of TV-watching pillow; it's certainly firm enough for that. But it's not something I'd recommend or buy for a friend or family member. The Boppy Wedge is an INFINITELY better buy for the money (see my review of that item), not to mention being a better product overall.
+1	This pillow made me more comfortable at night and I could sleep easier.  Around my fifth month, I had a hard time sleeping.  I could not get comfortable and was awakened by frequent leg cramps.  I put this pillow under my head, around my back and between my legs.  It kept me on my left side during the night and the extra support between my legs lessened my leg cramps.  The cover washed up very nicely and the pillow rolled up and fit right back into the plastic bag after my baby was born.My only complaints are that it takes up so much room in the bed when the sheets are tucked in, the pillow case is difficult to get off and on when it needs to be washed and the pillow doesn't fit me as well as it does the woman in the picture.  I am 5'10" and my head just fits on the top end and the bottom end goes between my thighs instead of my knees.  But overall, I was very happy with this purchase.
+1	I got this pillow when I was about 10 weeks pregnant. It really can make sleep easier during pregnancy and back pain, however I was never able to get in to the position pictured on the label. My belly (even later in pregnancy) never lay on top of the pillow like that. It is good for support between the legs and somewhat under the belly or behind your back. I haven't used it for nursing, but it is good for supporting you and the baby if you're lying down together. My only negative is it makes you quite hot, especially when pregnant. There seems to be little to no ventilation in this pillow.
+1	These are very soft on the inside and absorbent, and slightly pretty thanks to the lace. I'd definately recommend them to any new mother!
+1	very comfortable, and the bag they come with makes it easy for me to keep track of them in the wash.
+1	They feel great, better than the paper/disposable ones and I love the washing bag it gives you as well. The only con is that they look kinda lumpy at first in your bra, but I noticed once I have a shirt on it seems to form to it just fine. Very comfortable!
+1	I have had these for 5 years.  I have used them through 2 kids with about a year or so off of using them.  I always wore these even when I wasn't really leaking anymore because my nipples were sensitive and I didn't like them touching my bra.  I only have 2 falling apart-I bought 2 sets.  They will show unless you have light padding in your bra.  I found out the hard way of being exhausted that if you put the lace side to you that's not soft at all and is super uncomfortable.  My second son loved to put a "boobie pad" on his ear while he was nursing from 12 months + and would actually find one of these in the laundry basket to snuggle with for naps :).  I plan to buy another set of these for our 3rd child.  I did notice that some lanolins would stain these and they weren't absorbent enough for me in the early days so I used disposables for the first 6ish weeks.
+1	I have tried Gerber disposables, lansinoh disposables & avent disposables, as well as avent reusables & tommy tippee reusables. Avent is thicker and more absorbent for their disposables and their reusables, although i found that none of the disposables stay in place as well as any of the reusables.
-1	I purchased 2 packs of these pads with my first child 4 years ago. I really liked them and with my second, I needed one more pack due to a few being lost in the years in between. They still come in a great washable mesh bag, but the new pads are smaller and using very different materials than my first sets. I do not like this new style,OLD Version:4.5" diameterPoly lace exteriorJersey knit interior (only negative- it feels wet quickly)Overall very absorbentMolds to breast shape to create a concave pad interiorNEW Version:~4" diameterPoly lace exteriorFlannel interior (positive- it doesn't feel wet)Thin and not very absorbentStays in a flat shape and doesn't mold to breast shapeThe only plus with this last set is the flannel interior. Overall I do not like the smaller size and don't think these are nearly as absorbent as the older sets that I have. I will keep these as my emergency pads while my older sets will remain my everyday choice.
-1	The pads are small in size, and do not effectively coverage my breasts so even they move around just slightly, they just miss to cover at all or they just become wet pads that soak through my nursing bra.  If only they can enlarge the coverage size with the same thickness, and same lace design then they would be perfect.  For frame of reference, I am a 32DD and size small so they are small even for me.
+1	I have other AVENT products so I thought I would try this one as well. I was not really expecting this would be great pads, but for this affordable price, this is just good enough for me.
+1	I have tried a few types of nursing pads, and these are the ones I personally prefer. they are thick, absorbent, and heavy duty. They last a lot longer than others that I have tried, and hold their shape in the wash unlike others that bunch and wrinkle up. Also, the washing bag that comes with the breast pads are great to use for baby's socks, hand mitts, etc. I don't use the bag for the breast pads, I just throw them in the wash by themselves and haven't lost any yet. I highly recommend these!
+1	These worked great for my daughter, she did  have accidents at night time but these were fine for daytime use.
+1	These pads are a great way of protecting the environment. They fit in the bra snugly and are easily washable.
-1	After I had my baby and my milk came in, I was leaking like crazy and tired of spending money on disposables. These arrived and I put them on right away. However, I leaked right though them! They have no waterproof backing and are very thin so if you leak even a tiny bit, you are screwed. Additionally, they are scratchy and itchy and my poor sore nipples stuck to the fabric. Imagine my horror trying to peel them off my raw nipples :(
+1	I use these as well as the avent disposables. Never tried any other brand as I'm satisfied with these. Maybe I don't let down a lot but I've never had a leaking issue. My bras are mostly padded so they're not noticeable and even when I wear the non padded nursing bras they are still not visible. Love the included machine bag.
-1	I liked these and still use them sometimes, but they do not absorb as much as the disposable kind, especially at night time when you tend to get engorged. I would leak right through them, my sleep bra, and my night gown. Not fun to wake up covered in breast milk. :/
+1	I bought these inserts because washable ones seemed more environmentally friendly and were recommended to me by a friend. They work as expected, no embarrassing wet spots on my shirts. I only wish that I cold wear them at night for longer than 3-4 hours without having them soaking wet and needing a new pair. During the daytime, this is not a problem.
-1	I bought these because I hate using disposables and adding to the waste problem.  I'm sure there are better washable pads out there.  These are completely flat and don't bend much to contour to your breast or nipple.  They are super obvious under a thin bra or tank top.  Plus, they stick to you--not horribly but still undesirable.  I like the bag that comes with them but overall, I wouldn't buy this product again or recommend it.
-1	These barely absorbed when I had them in.  It was more like the milk beaded off of them.  I had high hopes but I was let down.
+1	These are great you can just throw them in the wash,  however if you leak heavily you might want to add a disposable behind them when you are out and about and can't change the pad because they are not leak proof always.
+1	My only complaint is that after 2 or 3 washes the fabric may start to "pill". I use lanolin so i make sure to pretreat these with some dish soap and allow it to sit overnight. Be sure to use the included mesh bag as these can become trapped under your upright washing machine agitator.
+1	Love these pads.  Was sceptical at first because of the lace on one side, but they are less visible through a shirt than ones without lace on the outside.  They ar small, yet absorbant.  I have had them leak but only when they got really wet.  I like that there are 3 pair, but if you order them you might want to order 2 sets.  Don't forget to use the included back when you wash them, they tend to get lost in pants legs and in the washing machine abys.
-1	I like the look of these, the lace on the outer layer is cute, but they don't hold moisture well at all. It's about as absorbent as a flannel burp cloth - if you leak more than a tiny bit,  it'll go right through the pad. I used these at night occasionally because they're soft and they would keep the milk from running down my shirt, but my shirt would be damp after every feeding. They're also very thick, which makes them very noticeable under a shirt. If you want a great cloth nursing pad, get Bamboobies - they're way more absorbent, thinner, less noticeable, and cuter. Don't waste your money on these.
+1	Not as soft as the fleece ones I usually use, but at least they're all cotton. When I'm especially leaky, I do have to swap these out for fresh ones now and then, as they get rather damp.
+1	Soft and the right size.  I do wish they would stop making nursing pads round and make them a little more breast shaped so you cant see them thru a shirt but so far every ones are still round.  They aren't too think but you can see them thru a thin shirt.
+1	These do a good job keeping me dry during the day, but constantly move around at night, which is when I really need them.
+1	Like those pads! The design is awesome and the other side feels smooth. washed them and i did not have any problems with those like it did with the cheap ones from walmart.
+1	i didnt want to use disposables as i think its throwing away money...these wash great and stay white!and the washing machine bag is a great bonus
+1	I really like Avent pads. After the wash they keep their shape (love the free mesh bag too!), there is no lint attached to the nipple like in some different brands and they stay in place due to the lace cover on the bra side. Also they absorb leakage well and the milk doesn't go through, unless pretty heavy one. I wear them with my bras and nursing tops and no one can tell I wear the pads.Only at night I have to adjust them due to laying on the side, but not a biggie. I wear them more often than disposable ones (I use Lansinoh and like them too, but they tend to roll when I fold my bra to breastfeed and adjusting is annoying because of the glue side).
-1	This product did not stop or even slow the flow of milk from my wife. It soaked through and leaked within 10-20 minutes. She tried it two times and then threw them away. Not worth the cost. Since I was buying for my wife and had no idea which pad would work, I also got the &#34;Charlie Banana Nursing Pads&#34; and they were much, much better and well worth the slight cost increase!
-1	I bought two orders, so 12 of these nursing pad hoping that they'd work well and I wouldn't have to buy disposable pads. I was hoping to save some waste and money. Well, that was till I figured out that these pads aren't really that useful and started to buy disposable ones. Here's why these pads aren't so great:1. They aren't large enough to cover a good amount of area.2. They slide around a lot, I find something soaked randomly - at least this happened while I was at home, not outside!3. They are NOT seamless, so they do show under your clothes.4. And MOST importantly, they aren't super absorbent. I don't really leak so much, but even then I find myself changing my pads 2 to 3 times a day.So now I'm using disposable pads. I wish these worked well.
+1	These things hold up well and never seem to cause my wife any discomfort.  The biggest complaint we have with these are they they diappear like socks would.  I highly recommend getting more than you think you will need so that when they 'go missing' you still have a pair or two handy.  I recently found some stuck to the inside of one of my shirts, and another hidden in some boxers after being laundered.  Blame static, but, its hard to find them when you really need them.  Prepare accordingly!
-1	I still leak with these.  They aren't as absorbent as ones I bought on Etsy.  Basically I only use them when I'm desperate.
+1	A must have when breast feeding.  These are however a little on the thick side.  You need to be wearing a heavier shirt or sweater/ sweat shirt to conceal pads in place.  Comes with nice small nylon bag to wash them in.
+1	My niece loved these pads. She used them all the time and they are comfortable and don't show through your clothes. Because you wash and reuse them they are even better. If it had been me I'd have wanted 2 packs but this was a first baby and you learn!
+1	The breast pads are soft and they absorb well.  I still leak through the pads when my breasts are VERY engorged (but I think that would occur with any similar product).
+1	These are great. Instead of having to buy disposables all the time, I use these at night, hand wash them while in the shower the next morning, hang them up to dry to reuse for the next night.
+1	Bought these by chance to try and ended up loving them.  They don't lay the nicest in your bra, but save some serious dough by not having to use the disposable ones.  Would recommend washing before first use though :)  Highly recommended.
-1	Wasn't impressed with the avent washable nursing pads for the following reasons:- material is non-absorbant- material is not as soft as other options available- pads stick to nipples- lace on the outside can be seen through bra/nursing tank- small circle creates a strange raised bump seen from outside
+1	I don't leak very much by my standards but these are definitely useful at giving me peace of mind. I bought two packs so I'd have enough for the work week. They're visible through your shirt if you have a thin bra and skin tight shirt but I don't wear hooker clothes and I usually wear a cardigan so its not a problem for me.
+1	These are perfect for the job.  Highly absorbent and prevents &#34;leak through.&#34;  Also better for the breast since some silicone pads just occlude the breast and have been linked with increased instances of mastitis.  Keeping is simple over here with these cotton nursing pads.
+1	Good price and easy to use. very convenient storage. I could only find this on Amazon. I highly recommend buying this product for your nursery.
-1	This is the most boring thing one can have in the nursery! Waiting for it to fall and break and buy a different one.Although looks arent of concern then its a good buy!
+1	I bought one of these for both my house and lake house. I love this product it stores everything neatly and the sides come off if you don't need them for ointment and stuff. I love this product.
+1	keeps all the diapers, lotions and creams organized. it doesnt move around and its sturdy. bought the wipes warmer to go on top. so worth it :)
+1	A friend purchased this for us because she loved the one she had. I have to say it has been a wonderful organizer and space saver. It keeps our diapers, wipes and grooming tools at arms reach and looking nice and organized. A really great item!
-1	This says it fits all prince lionheart warmers. Not true, I had to return it and purchase another model which then fit
+1	This product serves it purpose. We needed something a little bigger. But for the price it is fine. The plastic is sturdy enough. It was very easy to put together.
+1	This fits perfectly on our dresser next to the changing pad.  It holds everything we need for a change (I.e. diapers, wipes, rash cream, etc.  Plus I also have a brush and comb, thermometer, and hand sanitizer (for me) in it too.  This is exactly what we needed!  Thanks!
+1	This organizer was just what I was looking for.  I have a dresser/changing table combo and this organizer is a perfect fit! I am able to fit everything I need for a diaper change, with room to spare!  I love that the diapers are at my fingertips.  My one complaint is that my Huggies wipes container is just a tiny smidge too long for the space.  It isn't really noticeable when you look at it, but I just like everything to be perfect.  I don't use a diaper warmer, so I can't comment on that.  The price is definitely right and so far I am very happy with this purchase!
+1	This is great as a diaper organizer.  This is the second kind of organizer we bought and I can't say enough about how well it works
+1	This unit is ideal for organizing a small space and keeps everything that I need for a diaper change at my fingertips. It's the "must have" item that I hadn't considered until I started using it. The design and quality of the plastic is very good and I like the fact that the side compartments are detachable. I even bought the wipes warmer to go on top of it. I highly recommend this product.
+1	I needed something to use on top of my changing table and not hanging on the side.  This works great! Super easy to clean and stays in place without sliding.
+1	Keeps everything handy which is necessary when you have those surprise newborn diaper explosions.  It hold everything that you will need for a successful diaper change.  I love the side compartments and store my baby's after-bath essentials such as his nail clippers, Q-Tips and brush.
+1	it moves around a lot.but it does what it's supposed to.having a wipes case on top weighs it down a bit, which is good.all in all, not a great idea to have all this stuff on the counter where the baby loves to reach for it and play.
+1	It is what it is. The depot keeps everything you need to primp your baby in one small space. This had been very convenient for us, as we much prefer everything at hands reach. We can keep anywhere from 12-14 Pampers swaddlers diapers stacked on one side, and two 64 packs of pampers sensitive wipes on the other. The wipe warmer stays stocked with warmed huggies thick wipes for wiping baby down when a bath isn't necessary. The side storage hold his aveeno wash&shampoo, powder, desitin, comb, etc. The depot is worth the buy!
+1	I took the side attachments off (it's great to have that flexibility with the product) and just use it to store diapers and have the wipes warmer sitting on top. It's convenient and easy and saves space, which is a premium in my world!
+1	this is exactly what we needed to organize the top of our dresser that we converted to a changing table.  it fits perfectly on top of our dresser and with the lionheart wipes warmer on top.
-1	I really love this item, but I got parts of it broken. this why I am giving it a 2 star. I would have return it but in the long run it will cost me to much time and money.
+1	This is exactly what i needed! It keeps my baby station organized with the side pocket for my Peanut's powder, brush n. Comb, trash bags for used diapers, vaseline, ect. It's. Just big enough. I love it!!  AlohA!  Maui Grandparent
+1	Love this item and really love the price. It works great to corral all the little ones diapering items as well as a few of mommy's essentials as I keep it on my nightstand. My 16 week old just transitioned to size 2 diapers and 20 fit perfectly in the organizer. Love that it pairs perfectly with the wipes warmer too!
+1	We use this to organize creams, wipes and diapers on the changing table.  It keeps the area clear or clutter and we use it every couple of hours, so I can't complain.  If I could change one thing I would want it to hold a few more diapers.  I would recommend this to a friend and would purchase it again.
+1	This is a handy little diaper holder. It holds wipes and diapers and the compartments on the sides hold miscellaneous items. I wish the side compartments (which are removable) were more sturdy, but other than that it's fine.
+1	I had been told that a wipe warmer was a must have.  That babies are going to hate diaper changes just cause they get all cold and wet.  So taking that advice I bought a prince lionheart wipe warmer.  When I was reading the reviews on that I notice that lots of people complained that the warmer had messed up thier furniture.  I bought brand new stuff for my baby and didnt want to have this happen.  I was reading that some people had used cooking racks and other off the wall things to keep it from touching the wood.  I was hoping there was an easier way.  Then I found this.  The wipe warmer is no where near the wood now.  I love it too because it is great for small spaces and it keeps things organized.  I love that the side pieces come off.  If you arent using them or dont need them why have them taking up space.  It looks nice too it doesnt look really cheap and it matches everything being clear.  I really love this product... I am an OCD mother and this just helps me to keep things together.
+1	I have never been dissatisfied with a Prince Lionheart product. For the money, this is a nice dresser-top organizer. It has plenty of space and compartments for everything I use to diaper my son. I got this for his &#34;big-boy&#34; room, since we have a 6 week old now. It is so neutral, it blends right into his big boy decor, without calling attention to itself. I felt good about spending so little on something I knew we wouldn't be using for long because we are going to potty train soon. The product's construction is solid. It's a great buy.
+1	Fits perfectly on the crib, helps with having the right items needed for changing time at hand. Like the material also, can be easily cleaned and sterilized.
-1	I used this pump once a day or less and it stopped working after about 6 weeks.  While it was working it worked well and I liked being able to have one hand free while pumping.
-1	Honestly I bought this as a back up pump to use for emergencies and I hate it! It is the worst pump I have ever used! You would be better off getting a manual pump. It took me about 45 minutes to pump 3 oz. I would honestly not recommend this pump to anyone. I think they are a great company and I LOVE their bottles but this pump is horrible. There is a reason why it it $27, instead of the $100+ they originally valued it at!!
+1	I bought this pump along with the medela manual pump after being let down by the Avent Isis and I am so happy with my decision. Although its a little loud all electric pumps are so I cant complain about that. The neck of the breast shield swivels so I can hold it direcly in front or to the side of my breast (whichever feels comfortable at the time). At times I wish the suction was a little stronger but but thats only when im trying to empty my breast fully. Then I use my manual pump but when it comes to expressing for the babies thsi pump gets great results for an even greater price.
-1	This Monitor can be described in one word-Horrible.  My Husband and I would awaken in the middle of the night to this wretched static noise.  Our baby slept through the night since day one...it was the monitor that kept us up.  I finally gave up on it when she was 4 weeks old and got the sound and lights with dual receivers...it's been about 16 weeks since we got it and we have never had one problem with it. This monitor is not worth the money.
-1	We brought our baby home from the hospital yesterday and hooked up the monitors - they worked great...for 24 hours.  Now all we hear is static that only gives way to clicks and leaves us wondering which is more annoying.  To make things worse they worked fine yesterday so in my rush to clean up the house and be a good husband I threw away the box so now it looks like [$] wasted.  My wife has a hard enough time sleeping in between feedings without having to listen to static.  Don't waste your money - buy another one.
-1	I was told that this was a top of the line monitor but after receiving it as a gift, I had to return it because of all the static. I could not hear my baby at all! I purchased the Sounds and Light Monitor instead ... and I'm very satisfied with the exchange.
+1	I love this mirror! When I first bought it I was concerned I would not be able to attach it to my car, since I have the car seat in the middle seat and no headrest there. I was wrong: it was easy to install with no damage to my car and the mirror stays put. On top of that I can clearly see my baby and make sure he is okay.I recommend this mirror to worried Moms like me that like to keep an eye on their babies while driving.
+1	I put this mirror in my mid-sized sedan, and it works wonderfully!  The car seat is in the middle rear seat, and I was able to attach the mirror to the car interior by snapping the hook onto where a car seat tether strap would go.  However, the first time I tried to use the hook, it broke and I had to take it back.  The second hook worked perfectly.  It gave me peace of mind to know that it was hooked onto the car itself and would not become a projectile in a crash.  There is also a strap to fit around a headrest as well.I never found that my son looked distorted in the mirror.  However, he did look a bit small, but that wasn't a problem.  I actually didn't realize how small he looked until recently when I turned his seat forward facing and realized how much bigger he is in the mirror.  I was even able to find lost pacifiers using the mirror while stopped at red lights!!My husband has an SUV, and my son has to sit behind the driver's seat.  We did not find that using this mirror was useful for this particular car.I do want to note that one reviewer mentioned lights and music.  This model does not have those features, but a similar, more expensive one does.
+1	I love this mirror! It is very colorful and easy to see my baby since it is so big. Another good thing is that it stays in place. I hit every bump and hole in the road, and mine is still in place.  Simple, but it serves the purpose.
+1	I love that this mirror is cute and holds the baby's attention.  I also love how easily adjustable it is to different cars as we switch around on occasion.  I also think it attached the best of any mirror I found.  I like the dome feature because I can see the baby better from the front seat, although I would love to figure out a way that she didn't seem so far away because of the dome.  Maybe the next design they can magnify it or something.  All in all, it does its job and is cute on top of it
+1	Kushies AIOs have been a fantastic compromise between traditional cloth diapers and disposables.  They are as easy to put on as disposables, and much more comfortable for baby because they are soft and the material is breathable.  We almost never have leaks with them even at night or when baby is crawling (about the same amount as with disposables).  The natural materials seem to prevent diaper rash (my daughter has only had diaper rash once, and got it when visiting Grandma and using disposables). And they are SO cute!  People who see my daughter crawling around in her Kushies always say, "Oh, those diapers are ADORABLE!  Where did you get those?"Here are some tips to make using the Kushies (or any cloth diapers) easier:1) Before baby starts on solid foods, her runny poops will be much easier to clean up if you use disposable liners.  Once baby's eating solids, and her poops get more firm, just plop them into the toilet and flush them.2) Before baby can roll onto her tummy, and she spends most of her time on her back, fold the inside liner towards the back, since her pee will flow to the back.  Once she spends more time on her tummy, fold the inside liner towards the front, as her pee will then flow to the front.3) If you work full time (like I do), you will definitely be too tired to wash diapers every day, so buy enough to get you through a few days without doing laundry.  Many websites I have read suggest getting 20-25 diapers.  I'd actually say 25-30 is safer.  Yes, they ARE expensive, but shop around.  I ended up paying about $200 for 25 diapers (including shipping and sales tax).  If you figure about $10 per week for disposables, you will still end up paying less for cloth in the long run, even with the cost of laundering them.4) Never skip a change.  This could lead to leaks or diaper rash.  If your baby is a heavy wetter, you will probably want to use a washable liner at least at night.5) Before you wash them, be sure to fold the velcro tabs back.  If you don't they will stick together in the wash and not dry properly.  We just make a habit of folding them back as soon as we take the diaper off the baby.6) If drying them in a dryer, be sure to throw a dry towel in the dryer with them.  Otherwise you may have to dry them more than once.7) When you fasten the velcro, make sure the fit around baby's legs is snug.  Don't be afraid of making it tight.  The baby will let you know if she is uncomfortable.I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your cloth diapering!
-1	I have been using these Kushies cloth diapers for 2 months now. My son is now 6 months old. They only last about two hours before I have to change him.  If I wait longer than that, his clothes get damp from pee soaking through the diaper. I never use them when I am out and about or know that he will be somewhere where people might want to hold him.  The last thing people want is to have a pee stain on their clothes after holding a baby.  I feel that the pee soaks through so fast because the cotton inside layer sticks out the sides around his legs.  I have found that Flips cloth diapers and Mommy's Touch cloth diapers work best.Mango Snap Easy Clean Pocket One Size Cloth Diaper by Mommy's Touch with Microfiber InsertorFlip Individual: 1 One-Size Snap Closure Diaper Cover & 1 One-Size Stay-Dry Insert - Moonbeam
+1	For those people who have leaks and excessive dryer time -- do not use dryer sheets, anti-static dryer sheets cause a protective film to cover the diapers making absorbency almost impossible and causing the flannel to not dry as quickly.  You need to follow the directions as with any product, to ensure the items work correctly.---------Wow, what a great cloth diaper. These work wonderfully on my daughter (started using them at 6wks still using at 5 mos) and we have tried several others that didn't, including; dappi, sweet cheeks, fuzzi bunz and pre-folds.The Kushie AIO (All-In-One) comes in the following sizes:Preemie (2-4 lbs. / 1-2 kg)Newborn (4-10 lbs. / 2-4 kg)Infant (10-22 lbs. / 4-10 kg)Toddler (22-45 lbs. / 10-22 kg)(Babies R'Us sells infant and toddler sizes)Babies R'Us only sells gender neutral prints in packages of 5 at this time, but Kushies does offer plain white and gender specific singles as well.There are no diaper covers required (or needed) as the diaper has a wonderful waterproof exterior and a super soft, 5 layer absorbable flannel interior. It also has an attached flannel flap for extra absorbency. If you use the additional Kushie flannel liners (sold seperately) along with your diaper, it makes it even more absorbable! And adding a strip of flushable liner (sold seperately) on top of all that makes cleanup a breeze! The best thing in my opinion is that none of these extras make the diaper any bulkier, just more efficient and less messy. And I love that my baby doesn't have a drenched bottom when I change her... she's even less wet with the Kushie than she was with disposables!Washing has been great, I just soak the diaper in baking soda, dump the bucket with soda water into the wash and spin it out. I add a TINY amount of regular detergent and a cup of baking soda and wash them again. You can dry them in a machine dryer but I found that they shrink a little bit the first time and I know line drying is better for any kind of clothing. So I recommend line drying if you can. Anything lasts longer that way.Be sure to order from Babies R'Us so we can keep the diapers in stock and let your staff know if you want other Kushies diaper products so they'll know to start stocking more items!  Have fun diapering! And hope you enjoy your Kushies as much as we have!!!
-1	Not a very good cloth diaper.  The inserts are very inefficient in pulling moisture away from the baby's  bottom. This can result in diaper rashes. You might as well use prefolds and use a cover and save LOTS of money rather than use these diapers.Besides all the leaks with this diaper, they are really stiff.  I wanted to like this diaper, but am very disappointed.  We are much happier with Happy Heiny's and BumGenius for All-In-Ones.
+1	I have used these diapers from months 4 through 10 (and counting) in a large rotation of other diapers (from prefolds to BumGenius Organics) and finally feel qualified to write a review.  Overall, I have been very pleased.Like all cloth diapers, your success wth a particular brand/style may depend on your baby's build and activity level.  We have a small/avg baby and these definitely didn't fit him at 10 lbs, probably more like 12-14.  He was EBF at that point still and these didn't have a problem handling the waste.  Now at 10 months, these are DH's go to diaper for fast diaper changes on a squiggler.  The fabric stays inside the waterproof, so there's no adjusting or checking to make sure it's all tucked in, and the easy one step velcro is fast.  The only problem I am seeing is that as DS gets bigger around, the top can fold down a little bit, causing wicking.  I also don't know that they will last for another baby's worth of use, the cotton is starting to pill and the PUL is getting stiff.  But at $8/diaper opposed to the BG O at $25/diaper, defintely a fabulous value.
+1	I LIKE THESE DIAPERS A LOT!  THEY FIT WELL AND LEAKS ARE RARE...USUALLY OVER NIGHT IF IT HAPPENS.  WE HAVE FOUND THAT IF YOU PUT A WASHABLE LINER INTO THE DIAPERS AT NIGHT IT ALMOST ELIMINATES LEAKS ALL TOGETHER.  THEY DO TAKE A LONG TIME TO DRY, SO YOU NEED TO CONSIDER THIS WHEN WASHING THEM.  ALSO, I HAVE NOTICED SOME BREAK DOWN OF THE COVER BY THE WASTE BAND AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF USE.  THEY STILL WORK;  BUT CAN CAUSE AN IRRITATION ON OUR SONS ABDOMEN IF NOT WATCHED.  I HAVE NOT TRIED ANY OTHER BRAND;  SO I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO.  BUT I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND THIS IS A GREAT START.
+1	I've cloth diapered all 3 of my kids and I have to say these are by far my favorite. I've tried expensive $20+ a piece diapers but these just work better! Yeah they aren't as cute but they work and that's all I care about! Never had a leak and I love the natural cotton. Hard to find in an aio diaper. Most are synthetic material which lead to stink and build up issues. The people saying these are bulky....huh!? are you comparing these to disposable diapers or other cloth diapers? nothing is going to be as trim as a disposable, they are paper, these are cloth and these are actually very trim for cloth diapers! I started using the infant size when my youngest was 10lbs and even then they were trim. With that said, these work, are durable and priced right!
+1	I have a small baby that I bought the Kooshies for.  He came home at just over 6 pounds and 20 inches long (long and lanky), so the newborn size still seemed a little bulky (although he did not seem to care).  I tried to use both preemie and newborn sized disposable for the short term and for visits and they both leaked so badly that I had to change his clothes almost every time!  This is with three different people putting them on.  As a result I bring the Kooshies with me even on the go!  They are soft and absorbant and leak far less than the two disposables I tried.  TRY KOOSHIES,  YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!UPDATE:Now that my baby is a little bigger (around 9.5 pounds, 23 inches), I am still using the newborn size with a folded liner in front.  This significantly reduces leakage of urine on the overnight.  Although the disposables are working better than they did, the Kooshies still work just as good, if not better.  I still love the Kooshies.
+1	I ordered four different kinds of prefolds to try: Gerber birdseye, OsoCozy bleached, OsoCozy unbleached, and these Kushies. Initially, I just used the OsoCozy diapers because they were smaller in size than the Gerbers or the Kushies. However, they were all dirty one day and I pulled out a Kushie and a Gerber. HELLO!! The Kushies are so much more absorbent than either of the other two brands. Even though they are large, they fit very well into my son's Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps Size One, which was my initial concern. The extra material increases their effectiveness, but the fabric itself (flannel) is more absorbent than the other fabrics. Even when the diaper is soaked through, it does not feel as wet and soggy as the other brands. For that reason, I think that it is more gentle on my son's skin--AND it's softer than the other fabrics! For now, I just have one pack, so they have become my overnight diapers. I will soon be ordering more and make them my sole brand.My diaper system:I use Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps with prefolds; I have tried several brands, but prefer Kushies. I stash dirty diapers in a Planet Earth wet/dry bag until I have a chance to spray them off with the Mini-Shower Bidet & Handheld Sprayer, them I dunk them in the Bambino Mio diaper bucket half-filled with water and a 1/2 cup of Borax until I wash them. I run them through one rinse cycle, then wash them in hot water with Charlie's Soap with a single rinse. So far, no stains, and no skin irritation! I do one load of diaper laundry per day.
+1	The cloth diapers are great as burp clothes or anything else you need to use them for to soak up wet stuff.  They are at least twice as soft and thick as other cloth diapers.
+1	these cloth diapers are great.  i don't use them as diapers though.  i do use them mainly for burp clothes and they are great.  super soft and wash well.
+1	These are awesome.  We use them for burp cloths, padding around seats, for games of peek-a-boo, sloppy spills and all.  They are extremely soft and hold up wash after wash.  With 2 reflux-y babies, these were a must!
+1	I've always used Gerbers and to be honest, I never know what I'm going to get when I open the package, but I do know that I'm disappointed in the absorbency of Gerbers and started looking for something better. I've had the Kushies for a couple of weeks now and I'm pleased with them. They don't appear to be thicker than Gerber, but they do feel denser. They are also larger. So if you fold them down, it's like having a double diaper without the bulk. The Kushies are also softer than Gerber. The cost is more than Gerbers, but I only need to use one of Kushies to two of Gerbers. Less laundry with Kushies as I'm only using one. I will buy more of the Kushies.
+1	These are great as burp cloths! (I actually would like it if they were a little bit larger though)  I bought one package, but ended up coming back and buying 2 more. If you are buying for a first child, you just will not believe how many burp cloths you'll go through every day - stock up now!
+1	After searching online and in many retail stores at malls, Target, Babies and Toys 'R Us and Walmart, I was only finding these gauze type "cloth diapers".  I was appalled that these were considered soft enough or absorbent at all to be put close to my baby!So, after no success, I came on to Amazon and found the many incredible reviews of this product using them as burp cloths.  I decided to order one package and when they arrived I was thrilled at how soft they were and looked forward to using them with my new baby.  They absorb a great amount of formula since my son is quite a dribbler and they wash wondefully.  In fact, I think they have even gotten softer.  We were so happy with this product that we purchased another package within the first few days that we used them.So, if you are looking to use them the way we did and find that the gauze type found in most stores to be unacceptable, then get these!!!  You won't regret it!
-1	I bought these just to compare them to my Bumkins and Bummis prefolds and they turned out to be not as absorbent as either. I used them a couple of times and have just decided to put them in storage. They are also impossible to use with the snappis fastner. Definitely not usable overnight.
+1	We grabbed this tub @BrUs when our little guy started arching past the guard in his infant tub. It's been a great investment! When he first started to sit up he could lounge against the tail and I actually think the fact that it's inflatable helped strengthen his core enough to sit up successfully. If he topples over he lands on cushy air! Now that he's crawling, he flops all around, but the tub still prevents him from crawling out since he can't seem to get his balance on the wobbly surface. Well worth the money!
+1	I would love to review the tub, but I keep getting the wrong item. I have tried ordering the grey seal tub twice and keep getting the duck tub. I will update my review once I receive the correct product!Updated 8/27!!I never did receive the seal tub and settled for the duck tub, but found it much cheaper at another retailer's (bulls eye) website. I love the ease of this tub. It holds the right amount of water for my 7 month old to get cleaned up and still splash around. I don't have to worry about him tipping over and slamming his head on the tub. I also love that it hangs to dry, this is a great feature. I would recommend it!
+1	We received this second hand & began to use it once our child was 8months old. She is very comfortable while bathing. If she decides to throw herself back, the tail portion keeps her head safely away from the hard cast iron bath tub. I also like how the ducks head keeps her away from our tub faucet. We found that an air mattress pump works perfectly for inflating the tub & have only had to blow it up a little bit one time in the 2 months we've been using it. Rather than using the drain plug, I scoop the water out with a pitcher until I can tip the tub over to dry.
+1	This bathtub is great, but it only works for children who can sit up without support and even then, it probably won't last past a child's 2nd birthday.  It's too narrow for a bigger child.  I know it's a lot to ask that a tub work for a newborn baby, a sitting baby, and a toddler, but as a parent with tons of baby things already, I look for items that will accommodate and grow with my child.  Anything that will last longer and is multi-functional is greatly appreciated.However, like I said, it is cute enough that I bought it anyway and my son loves playing in it.  I agree with the other reviewer who said that the baby can't squeeze the beak.  It might just be that it's fun for us adults to watch their child play in such a cute tub.
+1	This has got to be the best baby item we have purchased since our boy was born, he loves it and the soft sides mean that mum doesn't worry as much when he's in it.
+1	Although I bought this tub to hold baby shower gifts at a shower themed &#34;rubber duckie,&#34; This is a great little tub. It came with a separate thermometer for the bath water. and, it is really cute, too!
+1	I received this as a gift at my baby shower.  I started using it when my son was 6months old and still use it now that he is a year and a half.  It conserves water by not filling the tub, easy to clean, keeps his safe from slipping, great for traveling, easy to store . . . .A perfect gift for any new parents.  One of the best presents I've ever received!
-1	I bought this for my 6 month old who outgrew her infant tub. I returned it less than 24 hours later. It was not as large as I expected and not stable at all. My daughter is very active and this tub just did not work for us. There really is no "headrest" and as soon as you put even lukewarm water in it the hot indicator will change. Would not recommend-at all!
+1	My 6 month old son was getting too big for his infant tub.  He wanted to be in deeper water. This tub is great.  It is the perfect size for him and yet has plenty of room for him to grow into.  We have only had it for 2 weeks but it has made a big difference in bath time.  He is having fun in the bath again.  The suction cup is a nice feature.  We use it to hang the tub on the side of the shower to drain and dry. Great tub for the price.  Highly recommend.
+1	Tub fit perfectly and supported my son very well.  Glad I found this product. Lasted for a long time. Highly recommend!
+1	We've gone thru 4 seats, mini infant tubs etc for our (now 7 mo) old over the past 5 mo and nothing seems to be comfortable for him. He loves to splash and play and it was so dangerous in the seats and/or plastic tubs. I have watched this item on amazon and finally bit the bullet (it's only $13 after all). We are in night four and he LOVES it! It's a safe small space for him to splash and play and easy for us to control him w out filling up the entire tub. I recommend for all!!
+1	I got this for my 8 month old son and he loves it!! It just the right size and none of the air ever gets out of it.
+1	I bought this for my 7 month old who has been sitting unaided for months but tries to nose dive when he takes a bath. He is always slipping from having soap on his body and it makes me so nervous. I owned one of these tubs before with his sister but could not find them in any store. I ordered this online today and I am excited for it to come in the mail. The material in the bottom of the tub is non slip so the baby is stable, the sides are high and soft so if your child falls sideways they won't get hurt, and the design is adorable. I really enjoy this product.
+1	Someone gave this to us as a baby shower gift.  I smiled on the outside and on the inside thought "WHY would anyone want an inflatable tub?  What am I supposed to do with this?"Well, our baby was a teeny preemie and for the longest time we washed her in a hard plastic baby tub inside our bathtub.  Then we moved to the kitchen sink because both of us parents' backs were about to give out from leaning over the tub.  Then one day our baby discovered the joy of splashing and nearly flooded our kitchen.  So back to the bathroom we went.  But wait!  Baby was too big for the hard plastic tub.  So we tried bathing her loose.  Her bottom was slippery and she wound up sliding and hitting her head a couple of times while I tried to bathe her.  No, that wasn't going to work.Then I remembered the crazy blow up duck tub.  I ran and got it out, blew it up, and baby laughed and laughed at it.  You squeeze its nose and it quacks.  It has a temperature dot in the bottom-I take away one star for this because it reads HOT when the water is still cold.  But we were able to put baby in there and as long as we were nearby we were able to allow her to splash and be rambunctious in this blow up tub without further injuries.  Three months later it is still in great condition and baby still loves it.Would recommend!!  It's not as crazy as it sounds!
+1	Our son loves this bath tub! I love that it is his own inflatable tub within our tub. Makes me feel like he is a lot safer bathing.The duck is super cute and fun for him to play in.
+1	This is a great tub.  We used this for about a year before it sprung a little leak (well, my husband who is responsible for blowing it up might say it is was a big leak!).  It came with a patch kit, but we had misplaced it, so we ended up buying a new one about 6 months ago and it is still going strong.I can't be bothered with using the drain - this is such a small tub, so I can't comment on how the drain works on ours, but I just use a little muscle and flip the whole thing over to empty the water out.  Just lift the duck with one hand and put your finger under the suction cup with the other hand and you are good to go.  We don't do a soap fill up and then a rinse fill up - we just rinse after soaping, and it has worked great.My kids love the quacking noise, although they cannot see it in the tub, which is a little weird, but they like it anyway.  The duck is definitely large, so it can be an issue with a small space. But we have made it work...
+1	When we first bought our baby home, we needed a place to bathe him. So we purchased a bath tub device that fit into the kitchen sink. It worked well and we got good use out of it. However, after about 6 months of growth, the baby was getting a bit big for the tub. My wife began taking him into the shower and that worked well too. The kid just loves baths, I should add. Then my wife found this Munchkin inflatable tub which we're using at the present time.The inflatable tub works well. It fits our tub well and the kid loves it. Personally, I could do without the cutsie-poo duck head and tail as it increases the difficulty of storing the thing without deflation. Does the kid really appreciate the duck and recognize it? Not really. That corny stuff is for the adults and taking pictures. But the tub itself works well. He loves splashing with a little bubble bath in it. Our faucet extends far enough that the tub water can be continuously refreshed. The tub is easy to drain. I just open the plug and wait for the water to leave (holding the plug open with one finger speeds the process). I like the little heat indicator, but my own testing by dipping my hand into the water is all that's really needed. It's a good product that's probably a bit overpriced.Gary Peterson
+1	I was so sad when our boy grew out of the ducky tub. It was a great transition from the infant tub on the kitchen counter to the giant bathtub.  We used it for almost a year without any issues or air leaks.
-1	This duck was more of a fun purchase we thought we would take with us when we travelled. We used it once, its kind of annoying to blow up each time you want to use it and it just really isn't practical. It's cheap so its not a big deal, we just wouldn't recommend buying it. Good quality overall, we like the temperature monitor to show if its too hot.
+1	Only takes a few minutes to fill up. Temperature thing at the bottom tells you if it thinks the water's too hot. Nice thought, but I think its worthless. Pretty cute, my daughter squeals and waves her arms every time I get it down for her.
-1	This tub deflated/popped after just a couple weeks.. I don't know what happened but you would really be better off buying your baby one of those tub seats that they can actually sit in with the bars (the two that I have are aquababy and safety first).  My babies kind of liked this duck tub but they LOVE the tub seats soo much!! I sat them in their seats and they started laughing so hard and really enjoying it because they were actually in the water, it feels like a pool to them.. They can splash around and sit up on their own without falling over.  Do not recommend this duck tub.  Spend a little more on something that's more efficient, sturdy, and fun for your child.
+1	My 4 month old, although he can not sit up on his own yet, loves this bathtub!!  We use it for him to splash around and play in.  Since I have to hold him upright, I can't bathe him in it yet.  The suction cup for the duck to hang and dry from is useless; it will not hold the weight of the duck.  Really this is not an issue at all, we just turn the duck upside down in the tub and let it drip dry.  The "HOT" indication disk in the bottom of the tub stays indicating HOT even after the water has cooled.  Again, not a big issue - I can stick my hand in and tell if it's body temp or not.
+1	This is the most adorable tub I've ever seen.  We used it almost everyday for more than a year.  Then it began to deflate.  But can't blame the product since we got so much use out of it and my son was getting too active for an inflatable tub anyway.
+1	This has been the best bath investment we made for our son! He began using this on the countertop in the bathroom at about 7 months. He's 14 months now and it's in the bathtub. The quaker on the duck's bill still wokrs and it has a handy suction cup so we stick it to the back of the tub wall when done. It drains nicely. We've taken several vacations and it deflates with ease. I don't know why the previous poster said it took them a half hour to blow up!? I've inflated this within a couple of minutes with no problem. Their issue may have been that they didn't read the directions regarding the valve. Many inflatable items have a closed valve so when you try and blow up the item, you have to pinch the stem at the same time. This allows a little flap in the valve to open and let air in. The purpose is to keep leaking of air from the valve stem over time to a minimum. My 72 year old mother in law blew this up at the beach with no problems once I showed her the valve trick! We highly recommend this tub as it is durable and fun! We just squeak the duck's bill and our son comes running for his bath!
+1	Our little guy doesn't like the bathtub.  Hates baths all together.  But in this, we fill it up just a few inches and he likes to splash the water around and we can still manage to get him clean.  Solved our bathtime problems!
+1	We are very happy with this tub.  It worked well for a few months.  It was great for transition from infant tub to the big tub.  Its nice quality and when you squeeze the duck bill it quacks!  Our baby girl loves it! : )
+1	Once your baby can sit up, it is the perfect tub. We were able to use it until our son turned about 10 1/2 months and was able to start climbing out. He loved it, and it kept him safe.
+1	The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the drain plug that is difficult to set in place. Once it's on everything works good, my boy likes it and I'd buy it again.
+1	This is SO much easier to bath my little boy in than the big tub. He loves to splash in it and can even lounge on the duck tail when he feels like it. There are a few down sides, though. I was expecting it to be a little bigger than it actually is. My baby is 28 inches long and when sitting in the back (by the tail), his feet almost touch the front of the duck. I was really disappointed about this. That means we can only use it for a few more months before it will have to retire. Another thing, by looking at the pictures, I thought maybe the blue part on the inside of the duck changed color from blue to white if the water was too hot, but no. That's not the case. There's a little blue circle on the bottom of the tub that says 'HOT' and you can only see it if the water is hot (obviously). You have the option to hang the tub up with a little suction cup on the bottom, but I haven't had any luck getting it to stay. Our bathroom (and apartment in general) is pretty small, and the duck, when blown up, is pretty big. It takes up a lot of space, and I really don't want to have to blow it up every night to give the boy his bath. We still haven't found a place to put it. Anyway, overall, I think this was a great purchase for the time being!
+1	My baby loves this tub.  I have one question - why on earth would you pay $44.99 for this thing when you can buy it from Target for $9.99?!??  My daughter is 10 months old and we have been using this tub since she was 4 months old.  Love it but would never pay this much for it!!
+1	We used this for each of our three children.  It's a great buffer from sink to tub.  The only downside, which is why I gave it 4 stars is that eventually it won't stay inflated.  This one I just bought....it's already in the trash.  With that said though, I still bought it knowing that I might only get a few months out of it (which by then they are ready for the big tub anyways!)
+1	Great transition tub. Our 5 month old is a very long baby and his newborn tub just wasn't cutting it anymore. He can sit up well on his own with a little support so this tub works well because it's not too big but not too small and he can sit and play fine with my hand on his back. Our first one had a slow leak so we ordered a new one and immediately notice something was missing... the duck doesn't quack anymore!! In the first one you squeezed his beak and it quacked, it was so cute and our son thought it was just hilarious. But they have now removed that feature. I was at Target the other day & saw it there as well and noticed their box had also omitted the duck quacking feature. Such a bummer! But still a good 1st tub out of the plastic infant tubs.
+1	When my daughter got too old for her bath seat I decided to purchases a "transitional" tub to ease her into the big tub. She loved this! I think it also helped in her liking baths in the big tub because she never once seemed scared of the transition when she got too big for this duck.
+1	My baby is 6 months old now and he outgrew his newborn tub. He was tired and cranky on it, now he's happy with this munchkin tub. He plays on it for almost 30 mins every night while I bathe him, it's like a spa for him. The only issue I find is he needs a lot of supervision, he moves a lot and he went underwater once by mistake, so I have to be super careful, but when don't you have to be super careful with a 6 month old! :)
+1	We travel a lot, so we were looking for an inflatable tub that would be durable and long-lasting.  It's been in use for about a month now, traveling to three different cities, and so far, we love it.  It's fairly easy to inflate (especially if you have a pump).  There's two sections that you have to blow up separately.  The inside of the tub where the baby sits has nice ridged lining to keep the baby from slipping.  It's also really handy to prop up our 4-month old daughter against the back of the tub so that we don't have to keep her head lifted up the entire time we're bathing her.  After bath time, we simply hang this up on our shower wall to dry, and it can conveniently stay there until the next bathtime.  Compared to a standard bathtub, this inflatable tub is just safer and more convenient.  We use it now even when we don't travel.  The quacker in beak of the duck is a nice feature, but it's a bit difficult to actually find the thing and get it to work (my 4 year-old niece couldn't do it).  But that's a minor flaw compared to the overall greatness of this tub.  Highly recommended!
+1	We bought this when my girls were able to sit up on their own very well, probably around 7-8 months. I had been using a newborn to toddler tub in the kitchen sink which was great but I could only give 1 a bath at a time(leaving 1 of them always unhappy sitting in their high chair) plus they discovered what splashing was and my hardwood floor didn't like that.The perfect solution was this inflatable duck tub. The first time I put this in our tub, filled it up & added daughters, they had a blast! They were laughing and squealing and splashing all over.The sides are a great height for them to hold onto and keep themselves balanced and they are durable as well...even when both my girls lean on the same side it doesn't smoosh down.This has really made bath time easier and more enjoyable for me and especially more enjoyable for them.It only takes me about a minute to blow this up. I don't think the temperature dot works well, I think my girls would freeze if I payed attention to the dot but I always rely on myself to test the water, not any type of gadget anyhow.
+1	Temperature gauge says hot when its just warm.. Hard to use because the head and the tail get in the way..otherwise it is a good travel tub
+1	I actually bought two baby bath tubs.... ( I wanted free shipping) so duck was extra tub.. We have not used it for bathing, but it is just so cute that baby likes to play in it . It is great for storing soft toys and  baby loves to remove all the toys and get inside.Well worth the price what ever the use. Would make a great and useful gift.
+1	At first our 9 month old daughter didn't like it.  It felt weird to her when she would sit in it because of the air pockets.  I let the air out a little and now she loves it.  It fits great.  No worry of her getting hurt as it's not hard plastic.  Her head rests nicely on the tail part.
+1	Bought  for trips but we ended up  using for everyday and baby loves it, keep her warm through the bath time, cozy, baby likes to play with duck!
+1	Takes up no space when deflated and is perfect for stays at grandma's or on vacation. Easy to inflate/deflate and drain to dry out after use.
+1	My experience may not apply to you, if you don't have a ridiculously oversized tub that requires about $15 extra a month in gas and water bills to fill for a bath.  If such is the case, please feel free to stop reading here.  I won't be offended.But I do have a ridiculously oversized tub, and I'm so glad I bought this bath.  Yes, it's large, but that's a safety feature for me - my squirmy 11-month-old can't climb out and get trapped between the duck and the tub walls.  I have no problem filling or emptying the bath from my water spigot, so I'm not experiencing any of the difficulties with this that other reviewers have.  The suction cup on the bottom really is meaningless; the bath won't hang from my tiled walls because they're slightly convex, so I just leave it in the tub, upside down, and wipe it down with an antibacterial cloth after use.  The bath fills with air quickly and stays inflated, which is a novelty for me in the world of baby inflatable stuff.  I've had to top up the air once in the past seven months.  The "hot" button seems to me to be a bit sensitive, but maybe my child just likes his bath water warmer than average.  He loves the fact that it's yellow and the same shape as his duck toys.  He likes to put bubbles on the duck's head.  He kicks back against the tail and chills occasionally.  So I'd say he enjoys the shape, color, and style, while I enjoy the safety and economy.  All in all, I'm sad he's going to outgrow this tub, and that they don't make it in my size.
+1	We are currently stationed overseas and have a home with no bathtub. This is perfect for our 10 mo son to clean up in and have fun doing so :)
+1	Love this duck tub, my son likes to play in it and fits well, he's 8 months but almost reaches the other side of the tub which is ok. Easy to drain and easy to blow up and deflate when needed. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a transition tub.
+1	Product seems to be good for now, but already seems to be losing air. Doesn't seem like it will hold up to multiple children, but wouldnt hesitate to buy another one for second child.
+1	I absolutely LOVE this tub, just bought the 2nd one because the 1st one got a mysterious hole in it (probably one of the cats sneaking up on it, too tiny a hole to find/patch.)  I bought the red tub with the Cars theme and was absolutely HORRIFIED to watch my 14 month old flip around, and tip over and nearly go under water a few times, even though I was right there.  It will be great in a few months.  He's about 33-34" tall, and still fits in the duck!  We moved to this when he got too big for the hard plastic tub.So- back to the Duck we went!  Delivered fast, inflates very easily (way easier than the Cars tub), it has a non-slip bottom, the sides are good to keep him away from the sides of the tub, the quacking is fun but not annoying, and it's narrow enough to not allow him to whip in 360's and fall over, or go under like the other tub allowed.I REALLY appreciate now having tried the Cars tub that the Duck has the plug in the bottom you can pull if you have a baby who thinks he's a fish and tries to dunk or you have a need to drain it quickly.  That's a HUGE safety plus.The original duck is still inflatable to an extent so now he plays with it in his play area, he'll sit in it, "read", put toys in it, bounce off it at about 60% inflated and not get hurt, he'll drag it around, it's awesome!  Highly recommend!
+1	This a nicely designed inflatable tub. We use it as portable tub when we go out of town. Grandma loves it. She thinks its very cute. It is fairly large and safe feeling. There is temperature warning disc at the bottom. Our son likes it so much we may use it as an everyday tub.
+1	My daughter absolutely loves this bath tub. She is comfortable in it and loves the bath more because of the duck
+1	The best part about this product is how perfect the size of it to transition sitting infants into tubs. The water outlet is a bit cumbersome to work with ESP with one hand. The duck is great for baby baths!
-1	I purchased this alongside renting a hospital grade pump. This hand pump is not worth the money. The rubber filter keeps popping out when there is a lot of suction. Maybe the women who liked this pump had smaller nipples than I do. Every time I have used this the rubber pops out. To put it back in you have to completely unscrew the cap and put your fingers in. A bad design and not at all sterile. Do not waste your money. I complained to avent and although they had good customer service and sent me out a new pump, it did exactly the same thing. It is the product itself that is defective
+1	This pump is pretty good for those times when you want a manual pump. The massaging petals do seem to help with letdown. It is compact and you can use it anywhere. I have a nice Playtex Embrace pump that I can use in my car and at work, but there are times when I can't lug my big carrying bag around and the Isis works great in these situations.I have taken it to theme parks (we left the baby at home with a sitter because of the heat, etc) and I just put the pump inside a soft cooler bag along with an ice pack and a couple of bottles. I have pumped in the car while riding and even pumped in bathroom stalls, if necessary.The handle does make a little squeaky sound, but otherwise it is quiet. The parts do tend to come apart easilly, and the handle falls off, but it's not that much of a problem. It didn't make my hand tired, even though I pumped for 20 minutes altogether, three times a day. I get out just as much milk with this pump as I do with my electric, though it does take a little longer than double pumping.I have pumped into the Avent bottle and then transferred my milk in the past, but since I use Playtex bottles and the One-Step storage kit, I have learned that Playtex will send you a FREE adapter for your Avent pump which allows you to pump directly into the Playtex bottles (Yay!)UPDATE:I had to change my review on the Isis after I had to use another manual pump in an emergency yesterday. I tried the Medela Harmony. Wow, that pump was wonderful! It really was 'silent' and easy to use! It was also much easier to clean than the Avent and I got out a record of 5 1/2oz in twenty minutes! So I guess that although the Avent is a good pump, I would have to say the Medela Harmony was better.
+1	I actually can get more milk faster with this than with the cheap electric pump I bought.  This one is easy to use and quiet.  If you are pumping more than once a day it could get tiring, but otherwise it's great!
+1	This was the first and only breast pump I bought.  My girlfriend suggested it and I'm glad she did.  It's very easy to use and I was able to express a lot of milk very quickly with this pump.  I highly recommend it!
-1	This pump is NOT efficient in multiple daily pumpings.  There are many things wrong with this pump and I hardly know where to begin.  First of all, the instructions are not user friendly.  Like other Avent products, the manual relies on pictures that can be difficult to interpret.  Once assembled, I found that the pump leaked as a result of the suction petals not attached completely and totally.  During the process of pumping, the valve that creates the suction would become loose and I would have to unscrew the bottle and press it back into place.  The pump squeaked sometimes and I couldn't quite figure out why.  The instructions recommended changing the position of the petals on the breast to get the most milk, however, during this process it would leak even more because the milk would collect between the plastic and the suction petals when the milk was supposed to be going into the bottle.  I also purchased the sterilizer which works great.  However, the instructions insist on sterilizing the pump after each use.  Frankly, there are just too many parts that have to be assembled and taken apart.  I didn't think there was a need to have sooo many parts.  Overall, this pump was very messy.  For a manual pump, it was more complicated than it really had to be.  And for all the reasons listed above, I find this pump to be overpriced and not worth buying.
+1	I have had no problems at all with this pump and would recommend it to anyone who needs one for occasional use.  It is quick, comfortable, and convenient.  I prefer this one to the expensive double electric pump we rented for the first month.
+1	this pump is great!  i'm not going back to work so i didnt need an expensive system.  in the beginning when breastfeeding is still uncomfortable, this pump was comfy.  i had to go back to the hospital after delivery, and couldnt bring the baby.  i used this pump 24 hours a day to keep my supply up.  that was when she was a week old.  i love it so much that it killed me to put away when i had to stop breastfeeding.  its quite speedy with getting the milk to flow.  easy cleanup and i was extremely happy with it.
+1	Originally I left a not sol great review for this product, but now I need to review it again.....I got this pump because I am a sahm and was going too exclusively breastfeed, but I wanted something that was small, fairly priced and convenient.  I found this pump, and since I loved all of the othe Avent products, I thought it would be great!  At first, when I was very engorged, I tried and tried 3x for 30 mins each and got only drops out.  I finally gave up and purchased an electric pump.  Now after 4 months of breastfeeding and occasional pumping, I am liking this item more!  I was in a lactation class and they cleared it up for me!  I found out that I simply did not understand how to use the pump, even after reading the directions.  You are supposed to start out fast to get the flow going and then slow to a suck and slow release once the flow has started.  After finding this out, I used the pump again and got 4oz out.  Still not as much as I can get with my electric pump, but this one works great too.  It will be great when we take a 12 hour road trip in a month!  I also love that you use the bottles as storage containers and all you have to do is pump and serve or store and defrost!
+1	More milk for half the time! This pump truly is wonderful...don't give up until you've taken this pump for a test ride!
-1	I ran out to buy this at the suggestion of the hospital's lactation consultant right after delivering our daughter in November.  She said it was a "good little lightweight pump, and affordable" --- well, I don't think [$$] for a manual plastic unit that hurts your wrist and breaks after 5 weeks of regular use should be considered "good."  I was dismayed to find how tired I became while expressing my milk twice a day -- the pump is not comfortable at all; the rubber guard has become loose and doesn't adhere properly to the breast, and the worst is that the neck has cracked on the pump causing milk to leak out.  I just called AVENT customer service and they tried to tell me I was using the incorrect kind of WATER to wash the unit out!  I suggested to them that they make a product that is durable so that moms don't have to waste precious time, money and effort replacing parts that should have been made properly in the first place.  SAVE YOUR MONEY -- DON'T BUY THIS ITEM.
+1	I gave it only 4 stars because I found the suction not so good with this pump unless I got it just right...I have large breasts (F cup) so I think that might be the problem. When I get it right...I can get as much as I get with my PIS...but I don't like that it's only one side at a time.
+1	I had extremely sore nipples even with a proper latch and my lactation consultant in the hospital suggested pumping.  She told me don't even bother with an electric pump if I had this one.  I was skeptical and bought a playtex embrace as well just in case.  Weelllllll, this pump works 100% better!!!  Just this morning I pumped over 7 oz for my 2 and a half week old (almost 3 feedings!!!).  With the embrace I was only getting maybe 4 oz.  Even though it didn't take as long because it is a duel one.  I'd rather pump a lil longer and get more!  Also the isis pump doesn't hurt as much as the embrace does.  However, I did have to take the massaging let down cushion out of the isis because i wasnt getting much with it and my nipples are too large for it.  The best thing about this pump is despite all the articles saying I wouldnt be able to feed him breastmilk for every feeding I'm able to and I'm also able to freeze half of what I pump every day since I pump way more than enough!!! My milk supply has even gone way up since my milk first came in just by using this pump.  I can't say enough good things about it!!!I havent had any problems with the pump losing its suction or anything breaking.  It's easy to clean...if you wash it in warm soapy water after every use you wont have any problems with the silicone parts wearing down or turning colors.  I dont wash my baby items in the dishwasher.  I trust my hands more.Like I said I use only this pump full time 10-12 times a day and have never had any problems!!!
+1	Actually is better than the automatic one, plus, you can take it anywhere with you.ah....Great Price too. Absolutely recommend it.
-1	What a waste of time &amp; energy!  This pump lasted a week before it lost its suction on me. Before it did, I could only get an ounce out at a time if I was lucky.  Buy any Medela pump instead.  I ended up buying a Medela when this one conked out even though I'm a stay at home Mom and don't really need to use it very often.  Sigh.
-1	I got this pump, because my electric one was a little noisy and I didn't like waking up my daughter in the middle of the night. At first the pump worked great... getting rid of the engorgement and pumping out most of the milk.Then it started making slurping noises and the rings for suction started to not go on properly (I have never sterilized any parts in a sterilizer or anything else or placed any of the parts in a dishwasher, so the reason for the parts not fitting right can't be because of them being warped or damaged in someway by me).Then, my milk supply started to diminish, due to the pumps inability to stimulate my breasts to keep producing, but I guess this feature would be good if you wanted to stop breastfeeding and ease the engorgement. I had to switch to breastfeeding exclusively, with no bottles, to stimulate my milk supply back, but now my daughter refuses to take a bottle what so ever.So now the pump just sits in it's little travel bag collecting dust, what a waist of $50.00.
+1	I have to say, as a first time mother I really thought that breastfeeding would be as simple as it looks. WRONG! I was in pain despite the fact that my son was latching on correctly. My breasts were so swollen I thought they would burst and feeding time sent me into a frenzy of tears. Luckily, my mother was with me and she too had breastfed. She went out and got me this pump (which I was just SURE I wouldn't need until I got close to returning to work) and the relief was short to follow. The pump is easy to assemble and just as easy to use. I could express enough milk in about 10 minutes to satisfy my son and give myself a much needed break for at least one feeding per day. I won't go into great detail about features since there are so many other reviews that do that. Just be assured that if you are having a difficult time breastfeeding at first, this pump just might save your sanity.One point to note, I see that some people have had problems with the plastic neck cracking. If you read the directions carefully they tell you not to use anti-bacterial soap to wash the pump or any of the Avent plastic pieces (including bottles I assume.) Some chemical in the soap can cause the plastic to crack. That could have been a contributing factor in some of the defective pieces.
-1	After my Medela Harmony suddonly quit working, I was in a rush for a new pump and ended up getting the Avent Isis.  At first I thought I had purchased a dud, but after a few minutes the pump grabbed on big time, and I was expressing milk faster than I ever had with the Harmony.  I do find that this pump works better for me when I remove the rubber "petal" lining.  And this pump can be squeeky.  The most frustrating thing for me though is that after using it for a little over a month the little white disk would pop out of place, just when I would get a really strong suction going.  Then I would have to stop and take the pump apart to get the disk back in position.  Also, the wide bottles don't fit very well in the bottle compartment of my diaper bag, and my daughter is not use to the wide nipples.  I use the Avent bottles to store milk, but I use the Medela bottles for feeding, which is kind of hassle compared to being able to pump directly into the feeding bottle.
+1	1st of all very portable, easy to use, and great low price. I currently expecting my 2nd child and was thinking of getting an electric pump, but after reading the reviews and the time it takes to express milk; I thought to myself why waste money if it's going to take the same amount of time.I was in the hosptital last year for a few days, in order to keep my milk supply, they gave me a Medela pump and let me used their (rental unit) Lactina. It works fine but cleaning the tubes and getting it set up is a hassle. I will consider renting it if I have low milk supply problem but I would not spend the money on the Medela pump.
+1	I have used this product every day for almost nine months, and I have been very pleased. I knew I wanted to breastfeed, but I also wanted her daddy to be able to feed her occasionally, and I didn't want to feel like I could never be apart from her. This pump is very affordable, and works very well. It easily attaches to any size bottle Avent makes, which is very convenient. It also comes apart for easy cleaning. It may not be quite as efficient as an electric model, but always works well. It's also small, which makes it easy to even throw in the diaper bag, if needed. I have been very happy with this pump.
+1	First let me say that I am a member and moderator at a forum dedicated specifically to Pumping Breastmilk and I have experience with a Hospital Grade Pump (Medela Lactina) as well as the Medela Hand Pump.  I pumped EXCLUSIVELY for 2 full months while working with my daughter to get her to latch on.  And I must say, even after using such a superior breast Pump (the Lactina) I think the Isis is absolutely fabulous!I used this pump once or twice per day in order to pump about 8 or so ounces so that my daughter could have milk while I was away for 3 hours per day finishing up my degree.  I found the pump highly effective and delicate on my girls. ;)  I love the convenience of having it pumped straight into the bottle.  All you need to do is attach a nipple or soft spout, the ring, and voila! Baby can be fed.  I was able to pump four ounces in about 5 minutes flat with this pump.Some people notice that they cannot get suction when they use the soft petal insert.  I was one of those people.  After removing that soft plastic piece I found the suction to be 10 times better so for those who are having trouble with this product please consider that.I wouldn't recommend this to women who are going back to work full time though.  I think it might best benefit those people to invest in the Pump In Style.
-1	I got this pump while my baby was on a nursing strike, and it helped me when I was engorged but even then it wasn't a whiz and now that I'm back to normal, it hardly works at all. The last time I used it (so I could have a night out) it took me 3 attempts and over an hour of combined efforts to get 4 oz of milk (wouldn't you know, she only drank 1/2 ounce.) Even when I would finally get a let down, the action/suction wasn't enough to keep it going. Also, I couldn't get the message cushion to work for me at all. The instructions say to assemble the pump while wet to improve the seal on the cushion and &quot;diaphram&quot;, but that still didn't help. It would stay sealed for a couple pumps, then unseal and seal again--off and on. Very frustrating to deal with--makes it hard to relax like you need to. Plus, when you realize how many cycles the hospital pumps go through to get however much milk, that's a lot of squeezing, which is also not relaxing. I was very pleased w/ the pump I used while in the hospital and am looking very seriously at buying the Ameda Purely Yours breastpump (as low as $140 in online searches.)
+1	This pump is good if you only need to pump once or twice a day. It's small, easy to clean and can be thrown in the diaper bag for on-the-road access. It's a little trying on your hand - but not nearly as bad as the one they give you from the hospital.If you pump all the time, or most of the time - I would suggest the Medela automatic pump. It gets far more milk out each time and takes about 1/3 the time.
+1	We purchased this a couple of weeks after our daughter was born.  We have the nice Medela plug in breast pump - however, it's a pain to travel with and it's pretty bulky.The avent has been great to travel with and really helps if I am ever engorged and just need to pump a little.It is also great because it's not loud, seems to pump effeciently, and also is easy to clean.A must have for any nursing mom!
+1	I spent the $350 on the fancy double Medela pump-in-style, but could never get it to work.  I gave up and sold it used at a fraction of the cost.I saw this Avent for sale for for $19 at some outlet and bought it with skepticism.  It works perfectly though - I used it every day for months; it has really helped me continue nursing without always being home or taking the baby everywhere I go.You can control pressure, speed, and it doesn't need batteries or make loud noises.  Excellent!
-1	I tried using this pump for about 2 days till I got too frustrated to try anymore. When I did get the proper suction the pump worked easily and my milk came down easily. It was easy and quick. However 90% of the time getting the proper suction going was the hardest thing. Thee were times when I got so frustrated from having to stop, disassemble and reassemble that I'd just give up. Maybe I did something wrong but when I called the company for help they weren't much help at all. Finally went out and bought the especially for baby electronic pump which is also about the same price and Im now a happy pumper.
+1	I LOVE my Boppy!  Everyone asked me, what's a Boppy. I figured it was just for feeding. Boy was I wrong. I breast feed my daughter, so I used it right away in the hospital. I also used it while in the hospital around my belly as an arm rest, since my tummy didn't work well as one any more. When I got home I found laying her in it was perfect, kept her upright so I didn't have to worry about her choking on her milk after feeding, since she has acid reflux the doctor suggested keeping her upright for at least 5 minutes after feedings... I have taken many good pictures of my little one as a baby, held her perfect. Now that she is learning to sit up, its a perfect helper.. I would definetly recomend this to any new parent!
+1	I love my boppy, my husband loves the boppy, everyone loves the boppy!I love it for nursing my daughter he loves it for feeding her with a bottle. He also loves to put his lap top on it on his lap. (attention computer geeks: the boppy is great for you too!)However Im not sure how long of a lifespan they plan these to have. I have been breastfeeding my daughter for 6 months and its about half the size it used to be. And my daughter is on the low end of the scale. I know that it gets used a lot but its supposed to.This version of the boppy is great though because you can remove the cover and wash it, something you will want to do.You need a boppy, your husband needs a boppy, everyone needs a boppy.
+1	This pillow is definitely a must have for any new baby.  I have used it for my 2  month old almost daily.  It's great for nursing, tummy play and propping her up so she can see the world.  It's the perfect thing for her to sit by me while I fold clothes on the bed.  I have also used it for my 7 month old niece to sit-up in before she could sit unassisted.  She loved it too.  I have washed the cover several times without problem.  We also use it as a "chair" under her play gyms.
+1	We are now using this tub for our 2nd baby and I absolutely love it!  For the first 2-3 weeks the baby is home we put the tub in our kitchen sink (large, single basin) and used the &#34;sling&#34; to carefully wash the baby and avoid getting the belly button & umbilical cord wet.  The sling does this well because the baby sits in the water but is not submerged.  Once the umbilical cord falls out and the baby is a little more steady, I remove the sling and use the &#34;newborn&#34; side of the tub.  You definitely have to stay right with the baby because they can tip to the side of slide down when not being held due to limited head control.  However, I think it gives the baby more water coverage which they seem to like and find soothing before bedtime.  As the baby gets bigger, I move this to the bathtub instead of the sink which allows for more splashing & playtime.2 features I really like, in addition to the newborn sling.1) The drain hole is very convenient for quickly letting water out.2) The storage area at the end is great for holding soap, wash cloth, etc.I am so glad we opted for this tub.  It's held up really well & I highly recommend.
+1	I got this tub party because I thought I would use for my newborn and when he got older. It didn't exactly work out that way, but I am still glad I bought this tub. The best feature about it is the NEWBORN HAMMOCK. It clips on both ends of the tub and helps newborns to feel secure and helps parents to wash the baby easier. Since you know they are secure in the hammock, you don't have to worry about them slipping under water or slipping out of the tub. Now that my son is older (7 months) we have upgraded to a bath ring. Once he started sitting up, the tub seemed too confining. But if you have a child that is scared to be in the 'big tub' this tub would be a good transition tool. The BEST tub for newborns and that to me makes it worth buying. Also the hammock can be put in the washing machine and the foam pads on the tub are mold resistant.
+1	We started out just popping baby in the shower with mom or dad for the first month, but once we were ready to soap him up we ordered this tub. It performed well with and without the sling until baby started to arch his back and scoot down into the deeper part on purpose. At that point I decided we needed to move to a flat bottom. Small enough to fit in the bathroom closet when not in use.
+1	This is an excellent and very affordable tub!  I ordered this for my 6 week old son and he loves it.  The sling makes it a comfortable experience for baby to relax in.  I love the colors and the little nook for the bath supplies to go into!
+1	I ended up purchasing the Safer Bather when our daugther was born. It was super soft and worked well in the sink.  However as she grew it seemed as though the Safer Bather quickly became too small. My neighbor had the Sure Comfort NB-to-Toddler tub and the sling feature worked so nicely! Our baby is really long and the sling had more than enough room for her stretch out.But after we didnt need to use the sling the tub itself was lacking for her as she got bigger. She seemed so uncomfortable and proped up in an uncomfortable position.I would still recommend this item just for the sling feature and the tub is designed to sit atop your kitchen sink which also makes for easy fill/empty.
+1	I registered for this tub while I was still pregnant, because it was much more reasonably priced than many of the other tubs, and got great reviews.  I have to say, I couldn't be more pleased.  Before our baby's cord stump fell off, the little hammock was great.  It kept her secure, and I could wash her back through the mesh without having to turn her over (if you've never washed a newborn, you'll just have to take my word for it that this is an outstanding feature).  Now that she's bigger, and has to sit inside the tub, she loves it.  It holds her completely comfortably (so she ENJOYS sitting in the bath, rather than screaming through it, as I've been told a friend's baby always does), and the padding keeps her from slipping around.  And it fits perfectly in our sink, which saves my back.  I couldn't possibly imagine a more expensive tub being any better.  I HIGHLY recommend this.
-1	After reading the great reviews I went with this tub. During the first use I was frustrated that my baby kept sliding down the sling. I quit using it for awhile and just used the foam turtle in the kitchen sink. Well now that he is bigger we started using the tub again. At 3 months he moves a lot. He is constantly sliding too far over to the side or his bottom lifts up on to the bump. I turned him to the infant/toddler side and he is not really ready for that. So basically this tub has been pretty worthless. I am going to purchase the Primo tub since the molding looks much more effective and safe.
+1	Arrived quickly. Next day. Cant wait to use it. I had one of these before and loved it. The sling worked perfectly in the first few weeks so that is why i got this one this time. would tell everyone to get it.
+1	We absolutely LOVE this product.  We had one with our first son, but donated it to charity when we moved.  When I had our second son we purchased one right away.  It is great when they are tiny little guys, and the toddler &#34;seat&#34; side is great for when they are bigger.  As he got older we set the tub into the big tub so he could splash around and I wasn't mopping up water every day.  If you have any questions about what tub to get, this one is by far the best we've tried yet!!!
+1	Giving a bath as a first time parent was made less terrifying by the sling.  When my daughter was big enough to do without the sling this tub fit perfectly on the floor of our tiny shower stall.  This tub is deeper than the other brands I've seen so I think it will last longer, my daughter is now almost 6 months and not quite able to sit up on the toddler side but has become quite comfortable lounging on the baby side... she likes to put her tailbone on the bump in the middle which allows her to touch the other end with her feet, making her feel more secure.  I don't see how that can be comfortable but she manages to get into the position no matter how many times I scoot her back.  My only dislike is that the trough on the end quickly fills up with water and can't drain.  Anything that you put into the trough then floats in cold stale water until you turn the whole tub over to drain it.  But that's a very small complaint, I love this tub!
+1	this is the best product.I bought it after redaing several reviews and am very happy that i got this tub for my little one. she loves it.
+1	I love this tub and how well it fits in our sink, but more importantly, our daughter loves it!  She was so tiny when we first bathed her, but the net worked perfectly for that.  Now she's almost ready for the sitting up side!  I think the bath is the highlight of her day, and ours too, because no matter how much she's crying, we can put her in this and she's happy.  I love that she can't really go anywhere, and that it's padded so she seems really comfortable.  Definitely worth the money, even at this point, and I think we'll still get a lot of use out of it!
+1	My son and I love this tub. I used the sling to give him sponge baths until his cord fell off. He is now 6 weeks old and no need for the sling anymore: he sits perfectly in the &quot;newborn&quot; side of the tub, without slipping. I also enjoy the fact that this tub has a separate water compartment than we put clean water to rinse the baby afterwards. The changing color plug is a plus, because it indicates if the water is too warm for baby.It fits perfectly in our sink too!I recommend this tub, it's great!
+1	This tub is wonderful the newborn phase of the tub is very secure and put me at ease during that first nerve-wracking baby bath.  My son is a natural water baby and loves to kick and splash, we have removed the newborn net and he's almost sitting up on his own...  I do not worry about him kicking around and sliding his head under the water due to the bump in the center of the tub which prevents him from sliding down too far.  This is a wonderful tub!  Even my husband feels confident enough to use it when i am not home!
+1	I bought this tub, but rarely used it.  As an infant my son was mostly washed while he was lying on the bed and I used a basin of water.  By the time he was really ready to be in a tub, we placed him on the teddy bear sponge you place in the bottom of a regular tub, which he enjoyed much better.
+1	I love this tub. We have used it for 8 months now. (we have a very small water tank that wouldn't fill the tub with enough warm water, which is being replaced as we speak...)The net hammock used as a newborn is great. Cradles baby very securely, but still allows baby to remain in water so she's not cold.The two sided option is great! My daughter used the reclined side with plenty of room for her little feet to kick until she could sit on her own. She is able to soak in enough water to keep her warm and enjoy with no worries of her slipping too far down into the water.We still use that side durring wash time, although she sits straight up and plays with her ducky now. I find it easier to wash all around her with her sitting up on the reclined side (she's more centered in the tub that way). I then turn her around to the toddler side for play time after. She then has lots of play area in front of her to splash and play with her ducky (which I can't pry from her little hand when she's in there!)The ducky has a "hot" indicator on the underside of it, but really, no matter how luke-warm the water is, it always says "hot" so we just gage with touch (as you always should) and ducky is just her favorite tub toy!I use my tub inside the bathroom tub so that she can splash and play without any worries of a mess or of falling over or out.The padding on the inside is just enough to keep her comfortable and safe from slipping. It is very light and inexpensive.I was initially dissapointed I did not buy one of the new tubs with a "shower." And, although it's a great idea, when I tried out a girlfriend's tub with the "shower" I didn't find it to be as designed to hold the baby as well. My daughter was 4 months at the time, and was too big for the "net" (her legs had no where to fit) but this other tub had no recline option, just plain basin tub, which was difficult because she could not yet sit, which ended up being very difficult to hold her upright at all times while trying to wash. I was also dissapointed with the "shower" as it was diffucult to keep running and was not more then a few trickles.Perhaps if they improve upon the "shower" tub design, or make a better "shower" we could have the best of both worlds. Until then, hands down, Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub has my vote!
+1	I love every aspect about this tub!
-1	After reading many good reviews, we registered for and received this product while expecting our first child. After she was born, however, it became apparent that it was a waste of money. She slid down the hammock constantly so we had to hold her up and keep her from having her head submerged, meanwhile, the hammock kept most of her body OUT of the water so she was cold. Perhaps some parents might be drawn to it because it will last them until their children are "toddlers." Good luck keeping a toddler in this thing! Perhaps if you have a shower only...but I think a bucket or deep try would work just as well and be a lot cheaper. After two or three baths I gave it away to a friend who was expecting and wanted to give it a try. We ended up using a towel on the bottom of the bathtub as a cushion until our daughter was old enough to sit up in the tub. When our second daughter was born we purchased a $6 infant bath sponge. It keeps her comfy, warm, and she loves it (and it dries a heck of a lot faster than the towel ever did). Skip this item all together.
+1	I got this tub for my baby shower. I had it on my registry based on the awesome reviews. It's been great so far. My son is 13 weeks old and we are still using the sling. It's easy to clean (just spray it all off with hot water after use), fits perfectly on our double kitchen sink, and my son seems comfortable in it. Simple, but all you really need.
+1	I bought this tub because of the "Hammock" for the newborns, I had read how the other brands hammocks would slip off the tub, THIS does not happen with this tub. This tubs hammock is very secure and safe. I had a space saving tub with my first child and the foam on it was always becoming nasty with bacteria, even though I cleaned it, This has NOT happend with is tub and I have been using it for six months now. It does work very well at the kitchen sink, but you still have to take it to the tub, flip it over and dry it out. It stores easy on a changing table shelf, this is great if you have limited space. I now use it in the big bath tub, because at six months my son splashes way too much, and I would have water all over the kitchen if I still bathed him at the sink.And even thought the plug is supposed to turn white if the water is too hot, PLEASE DO NOT RELY ON IT. I noticed it never changed colors, so with out my child in it, I tested it by putting hotter and hotter water in it. The water was steaming and scalding before the plug ever turned white. Even with this, I still rated the tub with five stars because no one should depend on a piece of rubber to keep thier baby safe, you should always check the water (your elbow is best) before putting you precious baby in the water.
+1	This &#34;toddler tub&#34; accomplishes with ease what it was designed to do:  bathe your baby.  The insertable fabric sling accommodates new ones while the base tub handles toddlers as they (quickly) grow bigger.  Softer skid resistant surfaces inside the tub keep the baby from slipping and where you want him.  Slots in the base keep the tub safely in place across a sink or you can sit it in the bottom of an adult bathtub (folded towel for old knees recommended).  Conveniently emptied from a drain hole, when finished it's easily dried and stored in a closet.  A great solution to an age old &#34;chore&#34;.
+1	We've had great luck with this tub. Many of the negative reviews seen to focus on the hump in the middle, and it must depend on the relative size and muscle development of the child. Our son has fit just perfectly.  The only problem we had with the sling, was our son did seem suspended too high--but we just added more water, so that the tub was full to the brim.  He was then high enough up that his back didn't rest on the hump and he stayed warm in the water.It is a big tub, so we have used it in the bathtub ever since his second bath on the kitchen counter when he peed on our toaster oven.  Which is sort of irrelevant to the tub, but highlights the dangers (an hilarity) of a bath in the kitchen.Once he got bigger, he fit just fine in both sides of the tub. Sadly, at 10 months he had gotten too big to wash easily and he can stand up, which is awkard with the shape of the tub. The first time we bathed him without the tub he CRIED!  But I bribed him with his favorite toy and now all is well.
+1	This tub was a great purchase!! I wanted a simple tub that I didnt need a users manual to figure out how it works and didn't have mechanical parts that could get waterlogged and broken. This tub does not disappoint! The design is sleek and simple, fitting perfectly into the sink. My baby has always been long so would stick his spindly little legs out of the sling, but it definitely served its purpose until he got to big. Now he lounges in the tub itself and loves his tubby time! You still need to tip it over to get every last bit of water out but that's really no big deal. I also love the convenient place to put shampoo etc! Great little tub!
+1	My first review EVER on any website but figure what site to better start my review process than Amazon itself.First, I received this as part of my registry and Amazon had sent the wrong version of the tub. Despite the error, Amazon customer service was outstanding. Not only did the rep corrected the mistake and got everything processed in a matter of minutes with free shipping to return the wrong product but the replacement came literally overnight at no cost to me or the gift giver. That's what I call customer service and surely many retailers should learn from Amazon especially if they want to keep their customers happy and loyal.Okay, now to the product... This is one of the most functional and practical item that all new parents should seriously have on their 'must have' lists. The sling certainly comes in handy for newborns as it acts as an extra support for their bodies and prevents them from sliding down. In addition, the storage area is a huge plus - the right amount to put in what you really need or use to bathe your child. To help the drying process, I angle it and put it upside down against the tub sprout, which I find to help a lot if you want to prevent mildew etc after each use.I'm looking forward to using this tub as my baby grows and transitions from newborn to toddler... &lt;(^.^)>
+1	I love this tub. The sling makes giving my month old daughter a bath very easy. At first I filled it up full enough to touch her back but found that when she would slide herself down a little it would get to close to her mouth so I drained it a little and it works great. I love that is has the holder at the end as well. I put everything I need in it so I never forget anything.
+1	We researched baths and finally settled on this one. It seems it will serve her well until she's ready to go into the regular bathtub. We have a 6 week old and have no problems with this, it is made well and there's a nice piece in the middle of the tub that keeps her from slipping down too far.
+1	This is a great tub but I don't see how our baby could use it as a toddler. The &#34;shelf&#34; that keeps a reclined baby up makes it so there isn't enough room for the baby to sit up. It's very good for the early months though. We removed the sling as soon as she had decent head control because it kept her pretty far out of the water. All in all, a good purchase.
+1	The sling on this tub is so helpful when bathing a newborn...perfect for nervous new parents!  My daughter is 9 months old now and still uses this tub.  Even though she has been able to sit by herself for quite some time now, it's reassuring to know that her back is well supported, and there is still enough room for her to play in the water.
+1	We bought this tub to replace the tub to seat universal system, which was just a nightmare.  By the time we bought it, however, my daughter was too big to use the sling, but I fold it up and use it as a pillow for her head.  She had her first tearless bath recently, and I couldnt be happier! She stays in place even while kicking her feet, and I don't have to scoot her up constantly. The plug fits easily without leaking. Would definitely recommend.
+1	I love this tub for a few reasons:1. Sling was great for new baby's first bath as my daughter ws 6 pound at birth and cord came off at 10 days)2. Once she graduated to no sling she was comfortable and in easy reach.3. Fits perfectly in my double kitchen sink which saved my back!4. Has extra space for bath items or rinse water for washing hair...I used for bothand works.5.Lightweight but durable, even after daughter tried to teeth on it.6. The plug temp guage works well when we tested it and once when I did not realize the water had changed temp while filling.7.Now that she is sitting up on her own the toddler side holds her well without her sliding over or to the side like in the open infant tub at Grandma's. The nonslip bottom works!Now for the cons:1.I do not think we will use this until she is a full toddler (7 months now) since she is on the chunky side,(where would her legs go comfortably) and may use a bath ring then.....Has worked well for 7 months and may use a while longer.
-1	The hammock was a waiste! Tried to use it, threw it out. The seat is not deep enough, my 4 months old is not even close to being covered by water, when he's on the &quot;infant side&quot;, but the other side is too upright for babies that already sit with no problems. I don't know if that actually works, he's not big enough yet. The tub doesn't really fit in either single or double sinks, we've tried both.I wish I knew which tub is better, so I could get it!
+1	The perfect tub it fits in our double sink and my baby boy loves the comfortable sling makes bathing easy
+1	This is the best bathtub out there trust me! You don't even have to use the sling unless your child is very small. Our son can't hold his head up but he sits in it perfectly. The back cradles our son and his head perfectly. Don't waste your time and money on any other tub!
+1	Okay, I bought this and didn't love it. Then, I bought the Primo bath so my baby doesn't slide around so much....well, she just wasn't comfortable laying in a molded position. Anyways, switched back to this tub. It's lighter and smaller, so it's easier to work with too. The only complaint is that your baby's arm may get stuck to the side of the inclined seat. Be cautious. Didn't happen to us since our baby is still small but I overheard a woman mention it at the store. Otherwise, worth the price!And the infant mesh net didn't work well for us....
+1	the best feature is the sling. it holds a newborn perfectly. my baby likes to hang one foot off the side and dip it in the warm water. there is a place that holds shampoo/baby wash. i'll be using this when my baby is a toddler too. another great feature is it has a groove in the back, where you can use it in a sink, or lean it against something to dry. it has a drain too. i don't use that though, because i put the tub on the floor. it's the best tub, and very affordable!
+1	My husband and I were too nervous to bathe our newborn daughter in the sink and she hates having sponge baths. We used this tub with the sling in it for the first time last night (the night it arrived in the mail!) and she loved it. She relaxed in the sling like it was a hammock. Make sure you adjust the sling before you put baby in it though. We put her in and water got in her ears because it was adjusted a bit low in the water. Also, it could be a drowning hazard. Watch your baby! I am looking forward to bath time now. This tub makes it a whole lot easier and fun
+1	This tub has been so practical. Yes, I leave it in the tub when NOT in use, I wash it before and after, the mesh for newborns are EASY to clean, dry and it has been such a useful tub.. I am glad that I had this apart of my baby shower registry.. Very good for babies, Mommy!
-1	The sling option was nice for my newborn baby, but, as he got bigger I had to remove the sling because there was a big hump of plastic jabbing him in the back. Troubles started when he was an infant, his little body squirmed all over and I had to wrestle to keep his head up and not falling into the water and body from sliding.I would skip this tub and use bathe a newborn in the sink and then invest in a Primo tub. That is what I ended up  buying and it is WONDERFUL.
+1	So far, for our newborn to two months journey, this tub has worked great. We have used it with sling only, which is great to have, washable and easy to put/remove.No leaks, great purchase - fits our standard kitchen sink nicely
+1	I have been using this bath tub for the past 4 months for my son. He is 5 months now. I just recently removed the mesh lining. This bath tub is really sturdy and has served its purpose well. However one of the bumps in the bath tub has bothered me. There is a high bump in the bath tub that would poke my little one in the tail bone when I had the mesh lining in and leave a red mark after I would get him out of the bath. Now that I have took the mesh lining out this bump seems to be a little too close only leaving him with a little space for him to sit on (if you look at the picture you can tell what I am talking about). So when I wash his bottom he has slipped right off it. Needless to say I have to be extra careful when I do this. Overall this bath tub is a decent product. I love that it adapts with the growth of your child.
+1	Here's a tub that makes both baby and parent feel secure at bath time.We got this tub about two years ago for our son. We used it for about a year with him. Now we are using it again for our newborn daughter.This tub has two outstanding features. First, the hammock holds a newborn or infant snugly. This makes the baby feel secure and gives you the ability to have a hand free. Thus, it's possible for one person to bathe the baby solo without worrying that the baby will fall into the water.Second, because the hammock has adjustable straps, it can be raised or lowered. This allows you to have baby out of the water for a sponge bath prior during the first few weeks when they're not supposed to be submerged. Once their cord stub falls off, you can lower the hammock so that they are in the water as little or as much as you want.As the baby grows, you remove the hammock. Baby can lie against the inclined side until he or she has the strength to sit up. Then, once sitting well, they can use the straight-backed side. Because the tub is small, it's easier to keep baby upright even when they haven't mastered sitting up. Also, another advantage over a bath seat that goes on the floor of the bathtub is that this little bath doesn't require so much water to fill, making bath time simpler and quicker.Some reviewers have complained that the tub does not drain completely when you open the drain plug. This is absolutely true; however, I think the drain plug is merely intended to drain out the vast majority of the water -- which it does -- so that you can turn the tub over to rinse it and drain it completely.  Without this drain feature, the filled tub would be incredibly heavy, making it nearly impossible to turn over to pour the water out (not to mention the mess you'd probably make trying to dump all that water down the sink!).
-1	After baby starts moving more and wanting to splash.. this tub is worthless. The bump in the middle that is suppose to hold baby in seeted position is worthless, they slide them selves right over it so it is then digging in their little backs. Also, it's not very slip resitant after your done with the hammock portion (wich starts to smell bad even rung & hung to dry) They grow so fast, don't waste you money on this tub.. I'm currently looking for another for my almost 6moth old son... Any ideas would be appreciated!
+1	This tub is amazing! It has the sling for infants and can be taken out as they grow into toddlers. Very user friendly. My granddaughter is very small and can still take a bath in it with the sling. I know she'll be able to use it for a long time.
+1	My baby loves her bath time. I have only used the newborn side so far because she is 8 weeks old but the wedge in the base is perfect to hold her little butt in place so she doesn't slide in. And it fits perfectly in my kitchen sink. Well worth the price!
+1	i received three different bath tub as gifts for my baby shower.  i disliked all three but had to pick one for my baby's use.  i always wanted to register for this tub because of its hammock feature, which i believe would cradle my newborn the best.  at that time, my only concern was for my newborn's comfort. i was so thankful to  get this tub a month later when i gave birth to my son.  my hubby wanted to return this and exchange for much more needed  baby supplies since we already have a tub in hand already.  but i was happy to have kept this one because my son, now 5 months old still enjoy bathing in this tub using the hammock.  i never had problems bathing him in this tub except when i take out the hammock feature.  i guess he was just not ready to immerse himself in water yet.  the caddy works well with me too because it holds everything i need to bathe him.  i believe, i had NO REGRETS using this tub.  just the perfect one for every babies.
+1	Handy tub. Fits well in the kitchen sink for my newborn. The sling is soft and comfy. The only issue we have is space for it to dry, but if you have a large tub or live in a warm area you wouldn't have a problem with it.
+1	I bought this when my son was born. It fits our single kitchen sink perfectly and he has enjoyed his bath since then. After he could sit up good, I bathed him in a tub but my mom likes it better than a tub because it would use less water and maybe easier for her to wash him that he wouldn't move around too much. (She watches him during day time). So when I bath my son now, he would always brings this tub to me because that's how he is bathed during the weekday so I'm sure he still enjoys it too.I like this product has different bathing positions and an area to put soap/toys. We did use the sling few times when he was born, slightly over 7 lb but he out grew the sling so fast so mostly he was bathed without the sling.Oh, you have to be careful when pulling the plug. My nanny broke it after few use (she is not the most careful person in the world anyway) so it's not so easy to unplug it anymore. My mom just lives with it.
+1	This tub is the best I've seen so far. We used the hammock feature until my daughter was about 3 1/2 months old, or close to 12 pounds. now she is in the infant reclining position. A great position for her to kick and splash. I tried to put her in the upright position, but it is still to early. There is a mini compartment for the wash, and other things you may need for bathtime. Durable plastic, easy to maintain. After baths, I drain and dry and wipe with a clorox cloth. The padding is mildew resistant, but you never want to take the chance.5 starsA great hint to you soon to be mothers: Dont bother buying that baby shower they sell. I see bad reviews anyway. Save the time of registry for something else and just use the spray from your kitchen sink. That saves you about 20 bucks. Enough for a jumbo box of diapers from Sam's club. Youll need that more than a shower anyway.
+1	I am so happy that I did my homework!  This tub is great due to the fact that it is really for Newborns-to-Toddlers!  The hammock/sling feature is great.  My daughter loves splashing her feet in the water and she's only a couple months old.  I originally had that other tub with the spray nozzle on my registry, but after reading horrible reviews for it, I decided to put this one on.  Boy, am I glad that I did that.  You won't be disappointed with this tub!
+1	Out of all the tubs, this is the one that made the most sense.It is inexpensive and practical!At 6lbs, my baby did great in the hammock feature! It really shaped to him and allowed us to easily get around.He was in there for several weeks until we took out the hammock and laid him down in the reclining position. He stayed there for several months until he was able to sit up.Now, he can sit (with support) in the sitting feature and play with all his toys!This has been a great tub that will help the baby transition to the big tub easily!
+1	I wanted this tub because of the sling feature.  With our first daughter, we had a bath sling we used, but it was "free-standing," so we had to put it in the tub.  (It didn't fit in our sink.)  This bathtub really answered our prayers.  I can put the whole thing in the bathtub so my girls can take a bath together, or, I can set it up next to my kitchen sink and fill it with water.  (It doesn't fit inside my sink.)  It is simple to drain - if I am using this on the counter, I just slide the tub over so the drain is over the sink, and let the water drain out.  The only "bad" think about it is that it's so bulky - but you're just not going to be able to get one that's not like that.  Maybe someone will invent one that folds in half!
+1	I registered for this tub after reading the reviews on this site, and I couldn't be happier. It is perfect for newborns because of the sling, and has plenty of room for a growing baby. I would strongly recommend getting a thermometer that shows the actual temperature of the water instead of relying on items to change color when the water is too hot.
+1	I love this tub....the sling is perfect for my newborn daughter....she absolutely loves taking a bath and does not fuss whatsoever. I do not have any other experience with baby tubs other than this one and i love love love it! the only thing i would want different is a draining hole on both sides instead of one side, but that is very minimal
+1	I'm not one of those people that search for lots of features. This is simple. The net stays in place, my 5 month old is about to out grow the net, but the cushion on the head will be comfy for him.  I love the tub.
+1	My 7 week old baby hated sponge baths for the first couple weeks after she was born but as of transitioning to this tub she loves her bath - as long as the water and bathroom are warm enough. I haven't tried it without the sling so far as she is still developing her neck control but I think with this positive start she will continue to enjoy bathtime.
+1	I love this tub. I love that it grows with the child! It fits over our sink perfectly.I wish it folded up or something because it does take up space but, it's not a big enough complaint to drop my rating to 4 stars.
+1	As most of the other reviews said, this is a great tub.  Only thing I have to add is that you should also buy a tub thermometer.  The rubber stopper on the tub is supposed to change color if the water is too hot for baby-but the water has to be way too hot before it changes noticeably (it does change slightly, but you can't tell through the water).  Otherwise, this tub has been perfect for us.
+1	I chose this tub because of the number of great reviews. I agree. It is a great product and a great price. I love the seating for my 3 month old. I also like the drain at the bottom. Clever!
+1	This is great for a newborn baby. It makes giving a bath so much easier because the baby can hang out in the sling. Highly recommended.
+1	Loved the sling for newborn bath time, the recline as she got older, and now 5 months old sits comfortably upright and supported in the infant toddler side. Perfect little grow with you bath tub
+1	I have used this tub for both of my sons.  The sling works beautifully especially for the first baths where you can't get the umbilical stump wet.  Once the umbilical stump fell off the sling is removed and there are two sides to the tub one where the baby reclines and the other side so the baby can sit.  The sling is adjustable to let the baby sit as high or as low as you want in the water.  There is a plug in the bottom that is good for easy draining..however I normally just dump it.  The plug also changes color if the water is too hot...however I never relied on this.
+1	I love this tub! It really does fit baby from newborn on up.  I have an exceptionally large boy (we just grow 'em tall in my family!), so I don't think he'll fit in it as long as most kids, but for newborns through 9mo it should work great.  He is 4 months now, and about the size of an average 7-8 month old, and he is using the &#34;toddler&#34; side sitting up (he already can sit up on his own for the most part).  He won't fit in it for way longer, but since he's sitting so well that's fine.This is very well constructed, and the bump in the middle really helps keep him from sliding around like I've had trouble with in some tubs.I would definitely suggest this to all new parents!
+1	I registered for this tub to have a lower-priced item on my list and it turned out to be one of the best things I was given.  The sling allows a newborn to feel secure so baths are a pleasant experience and when baby is bigger, the incline side lets him have little more freedom.  We used this from day 1 until my son was about 7 months old.  We'd still use it but he's too active to be bathing on/in the sink.  We used it across the kitchen sink so as not break our backs leaning over the regular bath tub. I did a test on our plug to see if it changed colors and it did slightly but, as was stated before, you shouldn't be relying on the plug to tell you if the water's too hot.
+1	This tub is terrific.  My 6-month-old daughter has been bathing in it since birth.  First we used the mesh sling, and it was wonderful -- no needing to be nervous about sponging a baby and holding her at the same time.  After about three months, we took off the sling and now she reclines on the infant side.  She loves to kick and splash, and there's enough room for her to do so!  The rubbery pads are great for no slipping.  Once she can sit up unassisted we'll move her to the toddler side, and probably move the tub from the sink to the bathtub (her splashes are starting to be more than the sink can handle).  I feel so confident knowing she's safe and supported in there.  Plus, it's easy to wipe clean.  Absolutely no complaints!** UPDATE: We continued to use this tub for our first until she was well over a year old (she's now 2.5), and it suited her fine!  Now, we are using it again for our second, who is currently 9 months old.  It still looks like new!*** UPDATE #2: My oldest is now 4.5, and occasionally has issues with her privates, so it was recommended that she sit in a Betadyne/water solution periodically.  We use this tub for that purpose, and it is still perfect!
+1	The First Years Infant to Toddler tub with New Born Sling is just great.  I could not believe, looking at it at first whether it would be comfortable for our newborn, but the sling is just great, and baby loves the warm water and fits comfortably in the sling as mom enjoys bathing her.It is built to place on the middle post or section between a double sink and the tub is rather sturdy when placed on our double sink, although like bathing our newborn in a warmer environment than a kitchen.  The tub is also not too heavy if you are carting it with enough water for the baby to bathe in.  There is a plug at the bottom for easy draining.  There are basically three ways to seat a babe. The sling for the new born a more padded seat for an infant to recline in and a more sturdy seat for the toddler to sit up in if you wish to use it.When you think of it, for the money, this Infant to Toddler tub will save you in the long run until your little one is ready for the larger tub.  Great gift idea and should be on every moms registry.
+1	Love it. Works great! I didn't use the infant insert, but the tub part works great! I love that I could lay him down or sit him up in it.
+1	IT WAS SHIPPED VERY FAST AND FITS PERFECTLY IN THE KITCHEN SINK....MY GIRL LOVES IT..THE SLING HOLD THE BABY VERY SNUG WITH NO WORRIES OF HIM FALLING OUT...I THOUGHT THE PLUG WAS SUPPOSED TO CHANGE COLOR WHEN THE WATER WAS TOO HOT LIKE OTHER TUBS BUT IT DOESNT..ITS VERY LIGHT BUT NOT TOO FLIMSY...IT DOES THE JOB WELL WHICH IS ALL THAT MATTERS
+1	The hammock is a wonderful feature on this baby tub; it is easy to clip on and take off. It was a long while until I felt comfortable putting my daughter in the newborn part without the hammock, so I was super thankful for it! It fit in our kitchen sink very easily to keep from having to bend over. I always keep her shampoo, soap, hair brush, washcloth and a toy in the caddy at the end, too. Now that my daughter splashes so much, I place it in the big tub, so if she splashes tons, the floor isn't soaked. Even though she could sit in the big tub, I prefer to keep using this little one, because it's so much safer. She's super secure in it (no slipping or falling over). It is a little bulky to store if you don't have a lot of space. I just store it in the bathtub upside down to make sure all the water drains out. It does have a plug to let out the water, but there a few spots that the water pools and doesn't drain without turning over. As far as the downside goes, the hot water indicator doesn't seem to be effective. It's best to test the water temperature yourself rather than trust the indicator.
+1	This bath is a great price and works well with small and large babies. I have one for myself and even bought one for a friend.
+1	Great 1st year tub.  It is shaped to fit the baby at a size ranging from infant to larger.  Works very well with the baby, gives better control over moment and sliding down. What I really like about the tub it can be used in the kithchen sink (no bending over)!  It also has a plug that you can pull to drain the water out of it for easy cleaning.
+1	As a first time parent, I was constantly reading reviews of baby items before I made purchases.  This tub was rated very highly and so I thought I'd give it a go.  No disappointment here--its rated highly for good reason.The tub worked beautifully for my premature baby because of the hammock that straps over the top, making it easy to give my baby a sponge bath while he was cradled in the hammock.  Now that he's bigger and doesn't need the hammock anymore, the tub is still working well for both of us.  The plug that changes color when the temperature of the water is too hot is hard to see, but it does work and its nice to have.Of all my baby item purchases, this is one of my absolute favorites.  I highly recommend this product--most especially for bathing your preemie or newborn!
-1	I purchased this item thinking it was BPA and phthalate free but it is not. It's never a good sign when there isn't even a recycling symbol on the item. We're trying to be as plastic free as possible so I returned it same day and plan to buy the Eurobath as a replacement. I will say that Diapers.com was exceptionally nice with the return. They provided a prepaid shipping label within minutes of my phone call to customer service.
+1	I absolutely love this tub. It is perfect for infants. It has a mesh hammock that attaches to the tub that keeps the baby in a perfect position. My daughter loves getting a bath. It also has a padded head rest. I would recommend this product to any new mother.
+1	Love this tub.  We tried the puj tub and it was just too awkward in the sink.  This tub provides a good support for our baby, we stopped using the infant insert around 2 months.  There is room for our baby to kick in the tub and good support for her back.  This is the best tub and a great price.
+1	I got this tub for my shower and just love it.  My daughter was born very small, 5lbs 7oz, and I am very comfortable with her in this tub.  I can give her a bath by myself with no problems.  She is very comfortable and happy in her &quot;sling&quot;.  I use the tub in my double sink.  I find that while she is in the sling, I can open the plug in the tub and use a cup and the faucet to bathe her.  The dirty water goes through the mesh sling and drains right out.  I just love this tub!
+1	This is the best bath tub ever! I have tried a few tubs and this is the best by far! Not to mention that i can grow with your child! I loved using the sling when my little guy was smaller but now that he has more control of his neck I can place him in the tub without it and not worry that he will slip. I wish I had this tub when my daughter was a baby!
+1	I have liked this tub.  The no-slide grips on the tub keep your kiddo in place well.  I also used a hand towel placed along the back of the newborn back slant to give even more 'grip-a-bility' when she was tiny.I have also used this tub as a 'holder' for her (empty of course) as a good place to set her down with a few toys.  She can't quite sit up by herself yet, but likes being upright.  This tub gives her enough support so that she can balance on her own.I have liked First Years products - I have the bottle warmer and drying rack too.
+1	When it comes to baby tubs, you don't need a bunch of useless gadgets that are most likely going to break after a short use.  Fold up tubs leak, why bother?  I don't need one with the shower attachemnt since I have a spray hose on my sink. I love this tub.  It fits my sink, it has a good age range, the temp plug is a nice feature, and I didn't have to spend a lot of money.  Keep it simple, it's a bath tub!
+1	I was very confused to narrow down on a bath tub for my new born daughter initially, after reading the reviews for this bath tub, me and my wife decided to give it a try for my new born daughter. My baby absolutely loves to be bathed in this, she is so comfortable in this and the sling is perfect for the baby. It fits well in our bath tub, It is really a good bath tub and good value for money.
-1	I've had this tub for a little over five months. At first I loved it - I was ready to give it 5 stars but decided to wait on writing a review until I had it for a little longer. The sling worked great while my son was an infant and he loves bath time. Well - he got too heavy for the sling and I started using the tub. Well after about 1.5 months of used w/o the sling, I noticed some bumps on my son's bottom and back. At first I thought it was diaper rash, but then I began to suspect the foam on the tub. I did a before and after inspection of my son and sure enough no rash before the bath and after bath a big rash!! So, I'm now buying a tub that is all plastic. My belief is that the foam is collecting some sort of mold. I guess it's not good enough to just rinse and let it air dry? as a parent I don't have time to disinfect this with clorox and triple rinse every time it's used. 2 stars instead of 1 because it was useful during infancy.
+1	This tub is excellent.  I really love the hammock that comes with it for newborns.  It's good for babies whose umbilical cords have not fallen off yet and for parents who do not feel comfortable with putting their baby directly into the tub/water.  It also fits perfectly in my kitchen sink.  It's an awesome tub!
+1	We use this tub for our newborn.  The tub fits directly in my kitchen sink, so no need to bend over and strain to wash the baby.  It has a place to keep my washcloth and her shampoo.  It also has a convenient drain that changes color when the water is too hot.  My baby seems very comfortable in the hammock with the padded head.The only drawback is that the tub is large.  For me, this isn't a problem - I store it in our guest bathtub.  But if you have limited living space, it might not work for you.
+1	I researched all the Babies R Us tub choices before getting this one. I liked this one initially for the durability, easy cleaning, and that it can be used for a newborn, infant, and toddler. I have read other people's reviews and heard mention of problems with the hammock. Our daughter was 9.2 at birth. We did sponge baths on a towel until her umbilical cord fell off (at 5 weeks) and by then she was 12 pounds. The hammock worked great for her. We thought she might fuss about the new experience of being halfway submerged in water, but the hammock cradled her well. I like that it keeps half of her in water, keeping her warm and letting her bottom soak. She is now 12 weeks and over 16 pounds and is still in the hammock, though she's getting a bit long for it. Some people have mentioned hammock instability and having to use 2 people at bathtime. I bathe my daughter on my own most of the time and have never had any problems. Mine's a wiggler, but the bathtub configuration of having all the supplies needed in a built-in at one end makes it easy to keep one hand on the baby at all times. As for the temperature plug that some complain about...spend the extra $3 for one of the floating temperature indicators if you're worried you can't tell what is too hot for your baby.
+1	es perfecta porque tienes la opcion de utilizarla facilmente en un recien nacido,tambien tienes espacio para agua limpia,o lo que tu desees..y a medida que el bebe vaya creciendo tiene espacio suficiente para el.I love it !!
+1	This bathtub makes me feel much less stressed about bath time! The sling provides just the right support and elevation for younger infants. At 4 months, we took the sling out and our son fits perfectly in the angled tub. Now our little guy is learning to splash and will get to start playing with toys in the next few months. Great tub to use until babies are ready for larger bathtub. Also, it's easy to clean.
+1	I don't understand why parents are wasting their money buying those tubs with the showers on it.  PLEASE!  How hard is it to rinse a baby.  This tub has a great little basin at one end which that you can put fresh water in to rinse your little one's head after shampooing.  After words, I use it to store shampoo, my rubber ducky (the one that tells you if the water is too hot, because my plug doesn't work either) and washclothes.  It is hard to store because of its size, but I have found that under the crib is the best way to go.  Very happy with this tub.  You can't go wrong if you buy it!
+1	This was perfect for newborn grandchild. Daughter was very pleased getting this as a gift.  Made baby bathing safer and less stressful for everyone.
+1	We registered for this tub after reading reviews about several others, some much more pricey. This is THE tub for us. I love the cradle/sling feature for newborns! It's made of a soft, nylon-type mesh, which allows water to pass through while supporting a slippery newborn.There is a convenient built in pocket at the rear of the tub in which to store soaps, washclothes or rubber duckies. I like the drain feature, although I rarely wait for it to drain. I usually just dump it over after my daughter is out because time's a commodity with a screaming newborn. I honestly can't comment on the plug changing colors to make sure the water isn't too hot because hubby and I use our hands and own judgement to determine that. I don't think there is a device out there I would trust more than my own skin to determine if the temp is safe enough, though.The reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the netting being a little slippery. Baby tends to slide down after a while. But that's hardly a problem, since you shouldn't turn your back EVER on a baby in water anyway. I highly recommend this to anyone, and you can't beat the price!
+1	This was great it worked really well. I would use it again and again. Liked it very much it was really good.
+1	I bought this bath based on the reviews of other amazon customers and I have not been disappointed!  The sling feature for the newborn is wonderful--it keeps my little guy from knocking his wobbly head on the sides of the tub.  You can put water in the bottom of the tub for sponge baths before the umbilical cord falls off, but the tub will also fill up enough to allow him to sit in the water while in the sling now that he is able to take "real" baths.  He is VERY comfortable and looks forward to bath time every night!  There is also a plug on the bottom of the tub that will change color if the water is too hot. The plug permits easy drainage of the tub into the sink so you don't have to pull the whole tub out and tip it over to empty it.  Very nice tub, easy to use, small enough to fit in the sink (and out of site when not in use!), and--best of all--baby LOVES it!
+1	I love this tub! The hammock sling makes bathing an infant so much easier! This tub is the best!
+1	I received two bathtubs at my shower.  We tried this one over the other simply because it would fit over a kitchen sink well.  This turned out to be so great that we returned the other fancier tub.  I loved the hammock for newborns!  I loved the temperature colored drain spout.  I have a temperature duck also, but liked having the back up built in to the tub in case I misplaced the duck.  Now our daughter is in the sitting up stage for bathing and this tub still works out great!  Highly recommend it!
+1	From the first bath until four months later, this bath tub has been amazing! The sling is perfect and adjustable. The drain is perfectly placed to allow the water to leave while we rinse him with fresh water. It fits in the sink perfectly. Our little guy is very comfortable in it. He's not ready to leave the sling yet, but we are sure the tub will serve him well when he does. The only MINOR complaint I would have is with regards to the placement of the head. It is on the side of where the faucet is on the sink. I have to be very careful not to let the faucet touch the baby. If they had put the place for the head on the other side, the bath tub could not have been more perfect!
+1	We used this tub for 11 months!  She finally outgrew it and we moved onto the regular bathtub.  This little plastic tub worked so well for us.  It's portable and easy to clean.  We would use it again.
-1	My husband and I purchased this bath at Target because it was on sale for $15. At first I was excited but after using it for a month I'm pretty disappointed. The wedge in the middle of the tub that is suppose to support the baby's bum makes washing my 3 and 1/2 month old son pretty difficult. His feet already reach the other side of the tub so I don't see us using it much longer. We never used the sling either because our son would have barely touched the water in it.UPDATE: I didn't like this bath before but now I hate it even more. It's been about a month since I reviewed this and my son is now 4 1/2 months old, about 16 pounds and 24 inches long. He has become too big for the infant side of the tube, his back and bum can't sit comfortably on the wedge/bump in the middle of the tub and he can't sit up yet so the todler side is a no go.
+1	best on the market,price-quality - unbeatable.very comfortable,our daughter loves it,we saved a lot on this one,and we are so happy... :)
+1	My little one is 6 months old now.  We've been using this tub in the sink since he was a few weeks old.  He loves his bathtime!  My only complaint is that the small pad at the toddler end of the tub fell off.  We just used some goo gone to remove the remaining glue and he seems to be fine without it.  We'll soon be moving it from kitchen sink to tub as he is now learning splashing is fun.  :o)
+1	We have absolutely no complaints about this tub. We have been using it for 5 months. Our baby has always been in about the 50th percentile. We wash the sling in the washing machine and line dry it after every use. It has held up so far, and have no reason to suspect that will change. Since we haven't used it as a toddler tub yet, I can't speak to that. We've used the infant side with and without the sling and loved it every time.
+1	My son is going to be 4 months old soon and he is VERY small but very active. I registered for this tub because its cheaper, and much smaller than the other famous Euro Tub. I love this tub and do not regret my purchase. My son fits well in it and it fits securly in my double sink, making it much more comfortable for me to bathe him. I dont think that the tub "grips" so well but I just put one of those cheep baby towels under him. There is a space for his shampoos and soaps so I dont have to get the counter as wet. My son loves being in it and i dont expect him to outgrow it until around a year old! I also like that the water actually covers him and hes not soo cold (hes a winter baby). I drains really easily, but we always leave it upside-down on a separate dishrack and store it in the bottom of a sink. I dont see how anyone could find this too big, all infant tubs are and the folding ones really dont work. I love this tub and it makes bathtime fun for me and my very lively son.
+1	We love this tub. It fits well in our kitchen sink. The sling was a great feature for the first few baths when baby was new. Light but sturdy. Easy to wipe clean.Update: We recently took a road trip and after being without this tub for a few days, I now appreciate it even more. The grooves in the tub accommodate a growing baby so perfectly at each stage (the sling for the first few baths and then two sides of the larger tub...one for infant and one for toddler.) The grooves of the tub fit the baby's body perfectly and make it easy to wash baby with only one set of hands and the padded head portions provide just enough cushion but are still easily wiped clean. I used a few different tubs at grandma's and even a dish pan at another relatives house, but nothing compared to this tub at home. Bath time is so much more relaxed and fun for both of us when the baby is in this tub.Pros: Easy to clean/sanitize, fits well in double kitchen sink, sturdy, has multiple "stage" stations for a growing baby, convenient drain for emptying.Cons: Too bulky to take traveling, not easy to store.
+1	the best little tub for babies to keep them safe and happy. my kids loved it and i still use it today(2 years later)
+1	We bought this little baby tub when my daughter was just born and used the sling for the first 2 months - it's been so perfect! My husband has a bad back and it will be very difficult for him to lean over the regular tub when she outgrows this, so we will be using it as long as possible.  My daughter was 8lbs 6 oz at birth and fit perfectly into the sling.  It dries quickly and is a no muss no fuss operation.  She's 7 months now and loves her baths - splashes and kicks and has a ball in the tub.  I just put a towel down on the floor by the kitchen sink - no mess to clean up.  The  spongey stick on no-slip decals where she sits and leans back are great - she doesn't slip and slide all over the place.  Just rinse the tub out and air dry, it's ready for her next bath in minutes.  We had a single basin sink - extra big - and now have a double sink  and this little tub fit them both great. Highly recommend this tub, it will save your back and arms and make bathtime a fun experience rather than a chore!
+1	I had orignally registered for the 4 in 1 bath station.  Then I read the reviews of injurys cause by them.  Plus, my own cousin said it hurt her daughter as well....Then I read the reviews and switched to this tub.  My son and I love it.  The hammock makes it so easy to wash my 2 month old.  His body is supported so I rest his head on my arm.  I don't have to hold him up until I have to wash his back area.  He has fun kicking and pushing off of the front of the tub.It fits nicely in the kitchen sink as well.Love it!
+1	We received this bathtub as a shower gift. When my daughter was 2 weeks old she was ready for her first bath. This tub worked out perfectly. It fit great in our kitchen sink. It would let you know if the water was too hot.The sling for your baby to lay in seemed to be very comfortable. She has always loved bathtime. We would put the baby tub on our kitchen table for her bath until she was about 4 -5 months old then we started putting it in the regular bathtub. She used it until about 7 months old. Now she uses one of those seats. We are saving the baby bathtub for our next baby.
+1	We have been using this since our little one was a newborn till now (9 months old).  We first used it with the sling and then without the sling in the kitchen sink.  Once he turned about 6-7 months old we moved the tub to a regular bathtub since he started splashing the water a lot.  It fits him fine at 9 months still (he's 75th percentile).I don't clean it particularly thorougly, just rinse it out after the bath and stand it facedown against a wall to dry.  Will continue to use it until I am confident that our son can sit in the bathtub unassisted and not fall over.Highly recommend this product.
+1	My husband and I love this baby tub.  When our baby was a newborn, we used the mesh canopy which held her very securely and made those first few baths easier.  After a few months, we put her in the tub, and she absolutely loves it.  It's a good size--longer than other tubs, but it's small enough that I don't have to constantly worry that she'll fall under (although I still keep one hand on her at all times).  It was reasonably priced, too.  One of the best baby buys we've made thus far.
+1	This tub has really been great!  In the beginning, the sling feature was fantastic because you can't get baby's belly button wet.  The sling allows baby to sit above the water but still be in it.The other feature that I really like is the recline position for infants.  My daughter (now 8 mos) still sits in the recline position sometimes.  I will admit that when she was smaller, she did slide around a little in the tub.  But, I fixed that by putting a hand towel behind her - that seemed to keep her from sliding.  Now that she's bigger though, sliding hasn't been a problem for sometime.I really like that I don't have to fill up the whole tub/shower for bathtime.  I can just fill up this little tub inside the shower, or my husband likes to use it at the sink.  Either way works fine.  I also like the water release at the bottom of the tub - it automatically drains for you.Overall, this tub is great.  My daughter is still able to fit in it just fine, with plenty of room for toys.  And I think it will last for some time to come!
+1	Great bathtub, I love the cloth part to hang the babies on. My only complaints are there are some nooks and crannies that don't drain (why they would do that I seriously have no idea) so you have to make sure to clean them out or it'll stink, and the padding started to come off after only a couple months of use, I'm sure I could fix it easily with some super glue though
+1	I got it on the recommendation of a friend and I am so happy with it.  The sling was perfect and I felt at ease using it when my daughter was an infant.  She loved playing in it as a toddler tub.  Easy to drain, the inside has a bit of padding and she didn't slip around in it.  Stores neatly under her crib.  Don't waste time and money on the "fancy" ones, this one is the only tub you will need.
+1	Great tub for the money.  Plastic is sturdy, no toxic plastic smell, no sharp edges.  The "hammock" is a great feature for floppy newborns. It allowed our newborn to experience warm water in the tub which he really enjoyed (compared to sponge baths).  Once he was less floppy, we put him on the newborn side without the hammock and then transitioned him to the "big boy" side.  He was able to sit on the "infant/toddler" side even before he could sit up on his own.  At about 5 months, he was too big for the infant/toddler side. (He has always been 25th perc weight and height).  This tub also fit perfectly in our sink and could be easily stored away in our kitchen closet when not in use.  We replaced this tub with the Primo Euro tub which. as a 13 month old, he is still using.  I would recommend this as a newborn tub. If you want a tub that can serve as a newborn and true toddler tub, buy the Primo and use a sponge pad on the newborn side.  You will not be able to wash a toddler in this tub.  I am convinced, however, that there is no such thing as a "newborn/infant/toddler tub" that will fit your baby at each stage and that you will end up buying at least one tub as your baby grows.
+1	This is a nice tub!! I am very clumsy and very uncomfortable washing my baby in the kitchen sink so I bought this tub that I can sit on the carpet to rub-a-dub-dub my baby. Very Pleased and I look forward to using this.
+1	Great tub!! This tub was great for spong baths because it comes with a sling so the first baths are a lot easier then having to hold a wet squrimy baby. Once we could give her a real bath the tub held her great. Bath time is one of her favorite times, she just loves splashing around in it!
+1	it has a  plug to drain the water out its great for my fiance when she couldnt lift more then the babys weight and i wasnt home i love this little tub it comes in handy and its pink lol my daughter just loves baths and she loves this tub she just sits in and laughs and plays and shes only 4 months old:D
+1	Still using this at the sink at 15 months old and 31" long.  Talk about $20 well spent - especially when it comes to the RACKET they got going on $$ baby items.  If you don't know what I mean, new parents, you soon will!!!  Hahahaha!
+1	The sling was easy to attach, and the transition to sitting in the tub no hassle at all. My son loves to kick and play, and this allows him to do so without me worrying about him.
+1	The three level settings made this tub last for a whole first year for our baby. I have a small tub and it fits well in that. The sling was little difficult to attach but once we attached it, it never slipped. My new born was very comfortable in the sling. we graduated to the actual tub when she was 2 months old. over all its a good product.
-1	I purchased this tub because of the high rating. I hate it!Here are some pros...First, the sling works really well for the new born. It's very easy to bathe the new born. The problem starts when we removed the sling. Second, the hump at the bottom works very well. It helps my 2.5 month old baby sit while bathing.Here are the cons:1. The plug. I put this tub in the adult. Since the plug is at the bottom the dirty water does not flow out once I unplug it. It's block tightly against the big bathtub. I have to lift my baby up while my husband pick up the tub to dump the water out. He is wiggling in my arm, wet while my husband fill the tub again with right temperature water. It's definitely a two men job. This doesn't happen if you bathe your baby in the kitchen sink.2. The tub is too short. My baby start to kick against the plastic wall at the end of the tub. Everytime he kick it, he lifted him self and his back ends up on the hump. Again, my baby is very wiggly.
+1	A friend of mine suggested this tub because of the &quot;hammock feature.&quot; Your baby is cradled in a &quot;hammock&quot; that attaches to the tub, making it super easy to bathe your newborn. The pads in the tub are soft and they are mold-resistant. It fits in any sink you put it in, single or double, and it will save your back, not having to bend over your own bathtub. I also like how it has a built in bath caddy to put baby's shampoo/soap/toys/washcloths whatever. My only two complaints are that the plug DOES NOT change color when water is too hot. When we used those little floating rubber ducks that have the word HOT on the bottom that turn white when the water is too hot, the plug didn't turn white. One day I filled it with scalding hot water (without my baby in it, of course) to see if it would change color and it didn't. I guess it doesn't matter anyway since you should ALWAYS check the water temp before putting your little one in it, but I thought it would have been a cool feature had it actually worked. My other complaint is that is is bulky and big and if you live in a little house like we do there is no room for it. However, I would still not recommend any other tub but this one.
+1	This tub works real good for our baby girl. After 2 months, the new was off though. Works well! Excellent
+1	As long as we used the newborn sling our son was very cozy in this tub and loved bath time. When he got to be 6-7 months, we tried removing the sling and it didn't go well. The plastic molding intended to keep baby sitting in place is just too slippery and anytime our son kicked his legs he slid his butt forward over the hump and we had to catch him before he got water in his ears. Needless to say this frightened him and he started crying, which meant bathtime was over. I'm going to get a tub ring for him to sit in next, but this tub worked great for the first 6 months.
+1	It works ok but flat bottom would have been better. Angled bottom doesn't work for my kid as my kid's bottom slides out anyway.
+1	i have had this bath through all three kids and it has held up.  We put the sling in the wash with no problems.  for baby # 3 i used it without the sling since it got lost sometime after baby # 2.  great bath!
+1	I used this with my first child until he could sit up without wobbling.  However, with my second child, I only used it for about the first month.  The sling is the best part, it cradles the baby so that you can easily wash the child by yourself.  I stopped using it with my second child because I was already filling the tub for one child, so I just figured it was easier to bathe them together.  Now I am using a seat that a friend gave me a that supports the baby in the tub, so once again, I am pretty much hands-free.
+1	This seat worked great while my daughter was little but when she reached around 21 inches and wasn't even a year yet it became difficult even if she sat in the toddler end of the tub. I would still recommend this and it fits perfectly in a single or double sink. I also like the feature where the plug turns white if the water is too hot. I would recommend this.
+1	This bath is a lifesaver, it fits over our sink beautifully and is really sturdy and a great design, well worth the money and very pleased with it.  I'm not really fussed about the plug as I didn't buy the bath to tell me when the water was too hot or not, any mother will know and check the temp of water before putting her baby in, and although you may seem wary once you're there doing it you'll know what I mean!  So for me whether the plug changes color or not is no biggie, I am always making sure the temp is fine anyway.
+1	The sling is perfect for a newborn. Makes bath time easy. This tub also fits perfectly in our kitchen sink. Very happy so far!
+1	This has worked well for us so far in these first 8 weeks, and we like that it is adaptable as the baby grows.  Sling is adjustable, but when babies are bigger, they sit in a different way and don't need the sling at all so it is removable.  Easy to clean off too--just spray in the shower, and tip upside down to dry in the bathtub.
+1	This is a perfect tub for any baby....newborn and up.  I have never used the hammock feature since the tub has a padded bottom.  When our daughter was a newborn we placed her in and there she stayed, never slipping, while we washed her.  She is now 7 months old and can sit up which makes bath time fun.  The color changing plug has also been helpful.  My girlfriend had her baby 11 days before me and she had purchased a different kind of tub.  She then had to purchase another tub once her baby could sit up.  I'd rather invest the extra money of a 2nd tub in my daughter's college fund.
+1	The hammock makes a huge difference. Baby is calm and happy in it. Mom and dad also feel more confident that he won't drawn in the tub.
-1	Our son was not a large baby, but he grew out of this tub within 3 months.  He also hated the sling that came with it.  The main problem we found was that our little guy was able to catapult himself upwards so easily when he would kick against the part of the tub that holds the washcloth/soap/etc.  This was not safe.  On top of that, he never seemed comfy.  We ended up buying the Primo Eurobath and it's perfect!  Bulky but a great tub.  I wish I'd registered for that one in the first place.  This Sure Comfort one was a waste of money, in my opinion.
+1	Bought this for my grandchild and my daughter-in-law loves it and says its so easy to bathe the baby in this. It is not too big and cumbersome and the swing part makes the baby feel safe.
-1	This was great until our LO outgrew the sling.  From about 3-5 months we couldn't position our LO regardless of the side we used.  He tried to roll off the sling so we had to remove it.  Whether he's on the infant or toddler side, every time he arches his back he slides and tries to lay flat but the dividers that are supposed to position and hold him in place jab him in the back.  It's actually left marks!  I'd look for something more rounded.
+1	We tested three tubs and this was the least expensive, but it was by far the best tub.  No middle bar to hurt little guys, not too much room that you have a floating baby, and it grows with baby and toddler.
+1	I purchased this tub for a friend, off of her baby registry.Prosexactly as picturedlarge enough for an older babythe sling seemed sturdyhas a plug for drainingConsI think it has a bit too many areas/crevices to be considered easy to cleanthe foam padding on it is a bit thin
+1	After getting the fisher price whale tub I realized the sling comes in very handy for infants who can't yet hold their head up! I returned the whale tub and got this one. It's perfect. First of all my daughter didn't like just being put into the whale tub. I guess she feels secure in the sling and never cried. It saves our ears the screams of our little one and now she actually looks forward towards bath time. All smiles from our little girl with this tub. Buy It. Save your Ears! Save her Tears!
+1	With all the bells and whistles out today on baby products, all you want is for your baby to be safe and comfortable in their tub.  This is definitely the case with this tub.  It is contoured perfectly to cradle your newborn and the padded backrest keeps him/her from slipping.  I did not use the cradle, although it is a nice feature, because I felt it made my baby too cold.  This simple design works perfect and fits on single and double sinks.  I love that I will be able to use it into toddlerhood.  The plug and built in wash basin are convenient added features.
+1	As a new mom it is hard enough learning to hold a new baby let alone bathe her.  This tub has gave me so much confidence that after the first bath, I didn't need to ask my husband to stand around, because all the nervousness was gone... the person who created this design had new mothers like me in mind... thank you, thank you, thank you...
+1	I researched and even got an expensive tub,which I returned. This tub is great in every way. Easy to use. I used it with my newborn and gave her baths without help many times and it was easy.
+1	It's so beautiful. I love it. And I recommended it to my friends. I think my girl will love it, too.
-1	This tub seemed like a no-brainer based on the many reviews, but I'm not thrilled.  Here's why:1) You only need the sling for about a week until the baby's cord falls off.  After that I find it far preferable to put the baby in the water because he is much warmer and happier.  Not worth buying this for the sling, just do sponge baths until cord falls off2) It's massive for a small baby.  There is a bumper to support their behind, but at 4-5 weeks the baby can arch his back and slide right over it.  I used a much smaller tub at my mom's, just a simple rectangular plastic thing that was just long enough for the baby to "sit" in with my support and he was much happier since he could push his legs against the end of the tub and not feel so out in the open.  With this thing his legs are everywhere3) Because it is massive, cleanup isn't fun.  Rinsing the whole thing out in a kitchen setting is awkward because it is huge. Would be OK in a big bathtub though.
+1	I read many reviews and decided that this was the best tub for my baby.  I have been quite pleased with it.  It comes with a hammock that securely clips onto four corners of the tub.  The hammock has a padded headrest and some mesh material for drainage and it is perfect for a newborn.  It washes up very nicely in the washing machine too.  When your newborn gets bigger and moves from hammock to tub, there are two different sides.  One has an incline and a pad for the back and the other side is vertical for when your baby sits up.  We are still using the inclince for our six-month old.  There is a spot for you to keep soap, shampoo and washcloths at the edge of the tub.  The tub is made to rest securely on the kitchen sink (it won't work with ours because we have three sinks with angled separations) and it has a drain plug at the bottom which will change from green to white if the water is too hot.There are only two minor problems I have with this tub.  Tub water goes down into two of the legs because they are hollow.  It is difficult to dry the bottom of these, and soap or dirt can build up.  I clean them out by putting a paper towel on the handle of a wooden spoon and wiping them.  The other problem is that the mat for our baby's back on the incline has slipped.Our baby is getting too big for the tub now (he's 30 inches) and he is starting to sit up well, so we will move him the regular bathtub soon.
+1	We use this all the time! It is great for on the go, fill it and toss it in the diaper bag. The lid is secure, and we have never had a problem with this dispenser. I also like to use it at home, it makes preparing bottles quicker and when you pour the powder in all at one time instead of using one scoop at a time, it mixes WAY better and you can shake less vigorously. I fill it and leave it sitting on the counter...which is great because my husband can make a bottle with out asking me for prep. directions (because for some reason he can't ever remember how to make a bottle when he needs to, lol).
-1	The product works but it is not as pictured. I had specifically bought this brand because it is the same as one I had bought for my older son. The tab to open it is not as pictured and makes it difficult to use. I thought I made the mistake and didn't really it was their mistake until I already opened and used it. So beware!!
+1	These little containers are just the best thing, ever!  I use one for formula and the other for cereal for quick fixes when on the road.  Just pre-measure what you need and away you go!  The lid fits tightly and I have never experienced any spillage.  I actually bought mine from Walgreen's (I was in a hurry), and I was kinda bummed they only had blue (I have a girl), but these little things are real time-savers.When making up the formula (I use Isomil Advance), I place two four ounce servings in one half of the container, and then a six and an eight in the other two sections.Very handy!  I love it.  I just wish there were more color selections, but function over form works for me!
+1	At such a cheap price, I was VERY impressed with the quality.  I haven't had any problems with the formula spilling into other compartments (I tested it!) and it's SO much easier than having to mix it before you leave, and wrap it in some kind of cooler thing.Just fill the bottle/sippy up with water, and mix it when baby's hungry!  Pours fairly easy, and is a REAL time saver!  It doesn't take up any more room than my son's sippy cups.Really a great buy - if you formula feed, you HAVE to have one of these!  (Also good for snacks like cheerios!)
+1	Sometimes the formula is passed from one compartment to another, but most times it does not happen. It is very comfortable and fit up to 8 ounces of infant formula in each compartment. It's great for when you leave home
+1	I always hated toting around the formula can with my other 2 children, so when I found this, I had to buy it. So far, I haven't seemed to have had the same problems as some of the other reviewers. It is a great help to have it already measured so that it cuts out some of the mess. The only thing would be if the hole was a little smaller. The larger hole makes it a little messier, but it's still a great product.
+1	Could not find this size at any store so thanks for making this easy to order ,fast processing which aloud my daughter to breastfeed with the correct size and make breastfeeding a great experience for this first time Mom.
+1	My daughter was small when she was born and we had trouble latching on.  The nurse went and got a nipple shield and an hour later she was eating away.  I have been using this since she was born almost two months ago and I have yet to notice any decrease in my milk supply. Highly recommend this product if you have trouble latching on.  Don't give up it takes time.  Also this product is very thin so the baby can still smell your milk and you still feel everything that you would without using one.
+1	It's really simple to use and put on, just rinse with some hot water and put on your nipple.  The lactation consultant at the hospital gave me a nipple shield to help my baby start breastfeeding.  What she didn't mention is that it isn't supposed to be used long term because it decreases milk supply.  Initially this worked great, but after about 4 weeks I was told by another LC that if I wanted to maintain my supply, I'd have to get my baby on the actual breast.  Trying to transition her from the shield onto my nipple was hell because she was so used to the plastic; I eventually gave up trying to transition her, but I continued to use the shield even though my supply was dwindling.  Just a few words of advice to anyone who wants to breastfeed:  it can be VERY VERY difficult- it's amazing how something so natural could feel so unnatural sometimes.  I went through so much pain and discomfort. I hated it for the first 6 weeks, but then I fell in love with it.  I felt such a deep bond with my daughter when I breastfed and all the pain and discomfort disappeared.  I actually looked forward to breastfeeding her instead of despising it!  But over time she began to reject my breast because she preferred the bottle.  I breastfed for almost 3 months with the shield, it's definitely worth it. Even if you only use it for a month or two weeks, it's worth it, the benefits are amazing and you can't complain about the price.A few more words:  anything that is artificial will DECREASE your milk supply-formula, pumping, pacifiers, using bottles (they confuse your nipple with the plastic nipple and they will prefer the plastic over you because the flow is much easier).  The best thing to do is nurse (although that may not always be realistic).  To help increase your milk supply: nurse often in the first few weeks, don't give pacifiers, bottles or formula. Also, try taking fenugreek supplemnents (or mother's milk), they worked very well for me.And last but not least, if you've tried and tried to breastfeed and it's just not happening, do NOT feel guilty.
+1	I needed this for my son to nurse. They work great when needed. Not much else to say but there is a word minimum on these reviews.
+1	It was important to me to breastfeed my twins, so I was worried when they had trouble latching on to my invited nipples.  My lactation consultant advised me to use a nipple shield for every feeding, and told me that eventually they would latch better.  The Medela nipple shield definitely helped my twins latch better. It was easy clean and my babies did not mind using it.
+1	Purchased 2 extra spares, when my newborn couldn't latch without it. Only used them the first month&#8230;.However, I'm glad I have them on hand for any future children.
+1	Help me out dealing with the soreness and pain of first weeks of breastfeeding. May be useful for teething period.
+1	I had a very difficult time nursing in the beginning. Without getting into all the details, I was given this shield in the hospital And hated it at first -- it almost seemed to make my daughter hurt me even more and she continued to be frustrated. Every feeding consisted of a failed breastfeeding attempt, followed by me pumping while someone else gave her some formula. Later, when my milk came in, I realized that the reason the nipple shield had hurt even more than her powerful suck was that she was sucking extra hard on my nipples because she was having to suck the thick colostrum into the shield and then out of the shield! Poor baby! Once my milk came in, though, I realized the benefit of the shield.I have been using it for 4 months. There are days when I consider trying to wean her off of it, but to be honest I just don't have the nipples for going shield-free. It hurts me too much to even attempt it, and I'm just not willing to put myself through that when she's doing just fine with the shield. The most important thing is that the milk gets into the baby!
+1	No where in my research for soothing cracked nipples where these things mentioned.  I heard it from my sister-in-law.  It seems after your 1st kid, your nipples are more sensitive then the first time around.  This helped protect the crack from the baby sucking each time.  You could pump to help solve the problem, but I did not want to do that in the middle of the night when I as already tired.  This made it much easier to deal with at night, and in the day if I was limited on time.  In lieu of the nipple shield, I also recommend the hydrogel pads for a little cooling, soothing protection.  I went 2 months with the cracked nipple, trying other methods I found online, until I was told about this product.  It helped speed up the recovery time!
+1	I am a 1st time mom and have conquered breastfeeding all thanks to the shield. My baby had completely rubbed the skin off my nipples and breastfeeding was painful. I have started using the shield and thankfully, am now healing. We use the shield with each feeding. Now I don't feel any pain during feedings. This has helped so much.
+1	My baby was in NICU for a week & was fed through a bottle so it was very hard to establish breastfeeding. my lactation nurse gave me the full coverage version of these to try and even though it worked it always seemed to flip and almost cover the baby's nose so I was concerned about her breathing. I got these and right away I noticed a difference and within a week I was able to "trick" her into feeding without the shields, YAY!
+1	My baby has a pretty poor latch and did some serious damage to my nipples. With the help of a lactation consulant, I did my best to correct her latch, but to little effect, so in week 3 we tried this.  You need to use this correctly, but this nipple guard can help both with latching issues and with soreness.  I give it 4 stars only because it doesn't always stay put, but that's the nature of such a product, I think.
+1	I could smack my lactation consultants for not recommending nipple shields when I told them that breastfeeding was too painful. My son is 4 weeks old and i've been pumping exclusively and feeding him from a bottle while trying and filing to get him to latch properly. With the nipple shield, he latched on the second try. They say these things can reduce your supply because your nipples don't come into contact with the baby. Well, guess how much contact we had with exclusive pumping: NONE!Now we just have to see if i can get him to nurse regularly with the shields.
-1	my baby would not latch starting day 3 so I started using the nipple shield as a temporary solution, because the baby latched right on to it and the &#34;contact&#34; is definitely the best one out there. however, he would not ween off of it and latch to my nipple after weeks of trying. breastfeeding also became extremely painful with the shield on or off. my boy is now 8 weeks, i have seen multiple lactation consultants, my midwives & doctors, i have gotten his tongue tie clipped, been treated for everything under the sun and still no latch! i think that the nipple shield delayed proper treatment and allowed him to develop a preference for artificial nipples. although i'm still trying to breastfeed daily i usually use a bottle... still hopeful!
+1	These saved my nursing relationship with my daughter. We used them for 6 weeks while we fixed latch problems and allowed cracked nipples to heal properly. I don't think we would have been successful without them. Make sure you get yourself an Internationally Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) before you use them to properly diagnose the problem and help you with fit!
+1	I could not have nursed without this shield. My son was born 3 weeks early and had trouble with his sucking and latch. This helped him be able to latch and helped me nurse him.
+1	My baby had latch problems which caused me TONS of nipple pain. This helped us both to make it through breastfeeding. Although it definitely helps reduce the pain, it tends to move around, which can be annoying. Recommendation: lubricate it with lanolin first to help it stick to your breast.
+1	THIS IS A GREAT PRORUCT. It seemed a little long but helped my daughter get used to silicone bottle nipple before I went back to work.
+1	I have a preemie who struggled with latch issues and a nipple shield was the only way she could easily breastfeed. We received the regular Medela shield in the hospital, but I bought the Contact shield once I came home. That little bit of a cut out makes a lot of difference. The shield is comfortable for us both and I'm glad to have it since we wouldn't be able to breastfeed without it. I'm in the process of weaning her off the shield and it's going well, but it's nice to have it handy just in case.
+1	Anyone who is breastfeeding needs this product in case you get damaged nipples from bad latches! I didn't have this product and got infections, etc., from bad latches while breastfeeding
+1	If you are having problems nursing in the first few weeks GET THIS.  I'd actually recommend to get at least 2 (since technically they should be sanitized, you can use one while the other is in the dishwasher or sanitizer)You have no idea,this thing saved my life.  My son is like a vampire and when I had some crack and bleed problems, this allowed me to continue nursing through it essentially pain free.Is also good for bad latch issues, I didn't have that problem, but some friends have said it was nice for that
+1	Breastfeeding has always been shown as this natural, wonderful experience. In the beginning it was a horrible experience for me. From day one, my baby didn't latch on right and as a result my nipples cracked, bled, and hurt so much. Every time I put my baby to my breast, I screamed in pain. Since I was having such a bad time with it, I was going to resort to formula. I felt so horrible because I was so determined to breast feed. My mother in law suggested calling her niece who is a breast feeding advocate so I went ahead and called her. This is where I learned about the nipple shield. She told me she used it for the whole year that she breast fed and it helped protect her nipples. So my husband brought the shield and I put it on and breast fed my baby. At first he wasn't to keen about the plastic nipple, but eventually he took it. This allowed my nipples to heal back up.My intention was to use it every time I breastfed, but after two weeks I decided to take it off and try. My baby had no problem latching back onto the nipple and from there we worked on his latched. There was still some soreness, but after a week we both got the hang of it. Now he is six months old and is still 100% breast fed. I have grown to love nursing and because of this shield, I was able to continue to do so.
-1	I know you can't expect much from these products but this was horrible. I followed the directions, washed it with soap and let it soak for 20 minutes before using it. After the first use it became flimsy and sticky and wouldn't stick to my nipple as I expected it to. Went in the trash right away. Was
+1	I recommend using these for short term use only. They are not recommended long-term, because it can affect your milk supply, and/or the transfer of milk from you to your baby, causing slow weight gain. However, there are some women who can use one for the entire breastfeeding relationship and never have a problem.I had sore/cracked/blistered and bleeding nipples from a bad latch. Breastfeeding was extremely painful. The very first time I used this shield, I felt no pain at all. It was instantly gone. The shield quickly filled up with milk and my baby had the swallowing sounds. I had to hold it into place a lot of the times, and had to wash it everytime I was done with it, but well worth it. If you are about to give up on breastfeeding because of problems with the latch, this can save your breastfeeding relationship. Try this before you quit.
+1	I was hesitant to use any type of breast shield as the information that I had been given said that they would cause a decrease in milk supply or nipple confusion for my baby.So, for the first few weeks of breastfeeding I suffered.I cried, bled, and my husband practically begged me to stop, as he couldn't stand to see me in so much pain.As a last resort before quitting breastfeeding I went to target and bought this shield after much research.  I decided that it was at least worth trying and if my milk supply decreased, it would at least be better to have some milk rather than be forced to use formula.I wish I would have known how much it would have helped since day 1.  Once I used the shield, I could finally stand to give a full feeding without using a painkiller.  The cracks in my nipples finally had a chance to heal!  Within a week or so, my nipples were healed using combination of lanolin and APNO cream (which also works miracles).  After a few weeks and fully healed nipples, I weaned myself off of the nipple shield and since then have been exclusively breastfeeding without having to once resort to formula or bottle feeding.Without the shield I don't think it would have been possible to properly heal the cracks in my nipples, which at one point bleed so bad and caused me to get infectious mastitis and have to take antibiotics.  I wish it were more common to recommend them especially in the beginning when the babies mouths are smaller and less likely to get a full latch.  I found my milk supply was not at all affected and actually seemed to go better for me as I was more likely to do more frequent feedings on both sides with the shield.UPDATE:At my son's last health check, he was 4 months and 18 lbs 12 oz and 26.5".  He has been consistently in the 95th percentile for height and weight (based on WHO charts for breastfed babies) since the third week (when I started using the shield), so this is a testament that I had no decrease in milk supply.  I also have been able to pump a small supply for emergencies.  Before the shield, he had lost more than 10% of his bodyweight at birth and they recommended at both the hospital and doctors office to supplement using formula.  I DID NOT do this, and stuck with breast only, and with the help of this shield, have continued to exclusively breastfeed throughout.Good luck to everyone and stick with it!
+1	I had the hardest time getting my son to latch on. The nurses were working with me at every feeding but he just refused to stay latched! I was so close to quitting. But a nurse had given me one of these and it was amazing! I didn't have a hard time getting him to latch on and stay on! He got so use to it that he wouldn't nurse without it.I now use it with my daughter. She was a very sleepy baby and had a hard time latching on in the hospital, so I made sure I brought one of these shields with me. After a few weeks I tried nursing her without it and she latched on without the shield just fine! (See girls really are smarter than boys, so naa-naa-boo-boo!)I continue to nurse my daughter using the shield because it's just so much easier to get her to latch on under a nursing cover, easier in case I'm engorged, and if she decides she's done and comes off while I'm in the middle of a let down we don't have a messy mess because it pools up in the shield for a few seconds giving me time to grab a spit up rag.Now that I'm around more moms with kids around the same age as mine, I've heard a few of them tell me that if they had known about these nursing shields that they probably would have breastfed their child instead of switching to formula.
+1	These shields work great for any new mom who has inverted nipples or whose baby has a latch problem.They do feel up with milk and cause the shield to come detached from the breast IF you do not use lanolin as a glue.
+1	I haven't had a particularly hard time breast feeding, but it would have been impossible without these nipple shields!  When my nipples are tender or the baby gets to lazy to latch without it, they are so nice to have handy.  I took my own with me to the hospital when I first gave birth and I was SOOO glad because they said that they couldn't give me any there since they weren't properly trained in teaching me how to use them.  Ummm... you put it on your nipple and go for it.  Easy stuff.  Would die without it.
+1	Highly recommend these nipple shields for protection of your nipple but also for babies that are between the breast and bottle feeding.  It's clears the nipple confusion instantly.
+1	best shields around
+1	I have flat nipples and absolutely could not get my baby to latch on. I was depressed and worried that I would not be able to breastfeed. The hospital gave me a nipple shield to use and it was great because a few days after my baby was born he was exclusively breastfeeding. In the beginning it was uncomfortable but I think that was because I had to get used to feeding, not because of the shields. My baby is now 3.5 weeks old. I have weaned him off the shield on one breast though he is still using it on the other one (I think I'll be able to wean him off that too in the next couple of days) so I will be able to breastfeed totally without it. Of course breastfeeding without the shield is much better and I see no reason to use it if you can get your baby to latch on, but if you have flat nipples and you want to breastfeed it is a total life-saver.
+1	I got one of these while I was in the hospital because my baby made one of my nipples bleed and it was too painful to nurse. The lactation consultant gave it to me to help me out and I could not thank her enough. I tell all first time mom's to get one now because it's well worth the money if you experience any soreness. I ended up buying a second to rotate them for washing.
-1	This thing would not stay suctioned to the table.  Period.  Took it back the very same day.
+1	I have two of these placemats. One for the diaper bag and one used as a backup while the other is being washed. I have bought this for numerous friends and everyone LOVES it. The one drawback for one of my friends is - their daughter learned right away to pull it off the table and refuses to use it. Eveyone else I know has had no problems with it. It catches food in it's little pocket, keeps the table clean and is easy to rollup and store away. I can't say enough about this product. My husband, daughter and I eat out 1-2 times a week (she is 230 mths old and we've dines out since she was born) and we use it everytime there's a table it will stick to (which is everything but tablecloth). We've used it sine my daughter was old enough for the high chair.
+1	My son would just pull these off the table.  I did better with the plastic ones that stick.
+1	Since my son started sitting in high chairs at restaurants, I've always worried about him eating off the dirty tables (or licking them).  So when I found this rubber placemat, I thought it was perfect for eating out.  It takes up very little space in the diaper bag since it rolls up into its "catch tray", it's super easy to wipe clean, and it doubles as a "protective guard" so my baby doesn't hit his face against the edge of tables.  The suction is pretty decent, it sticks on most surfaces.  All in all, for how inexpensive it is, it is a great product!!
+1	I love this product! It works wonders. I made sure I tested it at 5 different restaurants before I posted this. It worked very well and does it's job to a T! Lets be honest, we all have messy kids, so the chances that they're not going to get one item on the floor is impossible. This product definitely minimizes the issue by 90%. I'm one of those moms who said that I'm not going to let my child make a horrible mess on the floor if we went out for dinner. Well, that's impossible too. I literally picked up 2 to 3 pieces of food off the floor versus 40 pieces of food from before. I'm very pleased with this product and when you're finished with it, you can just roll it up and take it home for cleaning. Will recommend this to others.
+1	We just used the Tiny Diner placemat for the first time last night. It worked great. It gave me a place to put down my 10 month old son's food since he doesn't use plates or bowls. Despite his best efforts, he could not pull it off of the restaurant table once I had attached it with the suction cups. When fully rolled out, this gave us plenty of room -- even with his typical goofing off, all of his food remained within the confines of the mat. Yet when rolled up, it's only about the size of a paper towel tube, so it fit easily into the diaper bag. I felt a little frivolous about this purchase when I picked it up sort of on a whim, but I am so glad I did! We will not dine out without it!
+1	We like to take our baby boy (13 months) dining with us and sit him in a high chair at the edge of our table. My wife got a cover for restaurant high chairs, which can be amazingly sticky, and she brings along Clorox disinfecting wipes for other things within easy reach. This is the flu season, after all, and this year it's the swine flu we're talking about. Well, we try to protect the little guy, but his hands just get all over the table and everything else within reach, and then head straight for his mouth, of course. This past week my wife added a Kiddopotamus Tiny Diner Place Mat to our protective devices. It fits on any strange tables we encounter and it works very well.It works well on the home table as well, but here the emphasis is different. At home it's protection for the table, rather than for the kid. In either case, it fastens down with small suction cups. The little boy can smear stuff all over it and we can easily peel the mat off and give it a washing. Real Handy. It even has a little trough on the table-edge side to catch inevitable spillage in that direction. We chose the blue, but the green would have been just as good. We're going to get a lot of use out of this nifty little accessory.Gary Peterson
-1	Seems to be good quality, but wouldn't stick to our wood dining table - I tried wetting the suction and still no luck. It's been sitting in a drawer since we got it.
-1	Ugh, where do I start? The thing is complete crap. The suction cups stick for about 5 seconds, and since it's designed in "flaps" to fold up, not only does it unstick, the different sections actually flip straight up onto the plate. The pocket doesn't catch much food because it is angled *towards the table* instead of towards the kid. The texture is hard to clean, it's also bulky. I couldn't imagine toting this around to restaurants, those sticky plastic ones with the graphics are cheaper, disposable, and honestly much more convenient. I'm now still in search of a GOOD toddler placemat!
+1	This item is great for taking on the go--restaurants, playdates, friend's houses... I don't have to worry about plates being thrown on the floor or food getting all over a potentially dirty table. It sticks to almost all of the tables we've used it on and is difficult for my 15 month old to pull up--though he can if he really wants to. It's large enough to cover a nice size area but still rolls up easily and the material is easy to wipe off and take home to be washed. But it is not dishwasher safe and because of the suction cups, it's like trying to wash an octopus in the kitchen sink. I wish I could throw it in the dishwasher, but I understand that this just won't work with this great material. Also, don't cut on it. I made that mistake and easily cut the mat.
-1	As some other reviewers have said, this item does NOT stay flat  -- it comes folded in the box and the fold lines were very strong and couldn't be "unfolded" (isn't this not supposed to happen with silicone?  I think this item is a silicone-rubber blend), which made it hard for the suction cups to stick etc etc... between the item not unfolding all the way flat and the unevenness caused by the large suction cups underneath, bottom line is that the mat would not stay flat which made it impossible to put a sippy cup on it without the cup falling over and so on.  Ask me how frustrating this was with a baby who likes to flip everything over anyway, to have the items that I expected to stay upright falling over constantly.Also, other reviewers have noted that this item only sticks to glass tabletops, which means that when faced with a tablecloth not only does it not stick but the uncompressed suction cups make a nice uneven rolly playground for all of your baby's utensils, foods, and liquid to fall over and roll around on, nice and messy!  I also want to add that at one restaurant that had fancy wood tables, the suction cups had trouble sticking so my husband placed a drop of water underneath each suction cup like they recommend.... which worked fine, except that the moisture-suction blend left marks on the table!  I don't think it was permanent damage, but you never know with wood and moisture... that's just one more thing you have to be sorry to the restaurant for :(I bought this one insteadNUK Gerber Graduates 100% Silicone Platemat-- it doesn't have suction cups but it's PERFECT.  It's true silicone (and not a silicone-rubber blend) which means it retains its flat shape no matter what you do to it.  And the silicone-ness does have a "stickiness" to it, just enough to keep the mat from sliding around.  The pic description shows it rolled up, but I just fold it into quarters and store it in a quart ziplock baggie in my diaper bag, perfect!  It actually ships to you folded anyway.  And the edging on it (which the tinydiner mat also does not have) keeps spills from escaping and dropped food from rolling onto an icky restaurant table.  Can't say enough good things about the NUK Gerber silicone mat.
-1	This little mat has rubber stoppers on the bottom to hold it down. The only problem is that the little stoppers don't work.
+1	I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I OWN ONE AND USE IT ALL THE TIME.MY TODDLER LIKES TO PUT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING IN HIS MOUTH AS ANY ONE WOULD AND THIS PLACEMAT HELPS MAKE SURE HE ONLY EATS WHAT IS CLEAN AND HAS LESS BACTERIA.IT IS ALSO DURABLE, FLEXIBLE AND EASY TO CLEAN AND ONCE DONE, JUST ROLL IT AND PUT IT AWAY. AMAZING.
+1	This is one of the best inventions!  Going out to eat, you never know how clean the tables are, and I don't like the thought of her food sitting on whatever cleaning products were used.  It wipes "clean" with a diaper wipe, well, clean enough to roll back up and toss in the diaper bag without getting anything else dirty.  We bought a second one so we always have a clean one on hand.  I even get compliments from waitstaff for using it.  Gives them less to scrape off... ha, ha.  Definately worth it.
+1	The one down-side to this is that it doesn't stick well on some table surfaces.  It works great on some, and on others the suctions don't want to stick for anything (even wetting them as some suggested).  Besides that, this is a great &#34;plate&#34; for our 18-mo. old while out and about at friends' or restaurants.  It rolls up nicely and cleans off easily.
+1	We use this in tandem with the Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Graphite and we LOVE it.  Easy to clean, provides a clean surface to eat off of, and easy to carry along.  With the Inglesina chair, the handles keep the sides of the place mat down which is KEY.  Without the chair my son would just pull the mat and throw it on the floor and it would be useless.  The suction cups don't really do anything, but in tandem they are FANTASTIC.
-1	not too happy about this product. it was still a pain to clean. the kiddo can still splash food and drink. and after placing it in storage for a month or two mold started growing on it.
+1	This placemat has been a great purchase!  I purchased it for use when we take our 9 month old out and it has been well received!  Not only does it cover the table, it catches some of the food items my son drops.  This is quite handy and an unexpected benefit.  Love it and so does my son.  He runs his hand over it, feeling all of the textures.
+1	I'm so happy I took a chance on this product! I carry this matt (rolled up) in the basket of our stroller when we go out in case we eat out, and always make sure to take it when we visit friends and family. It's great to have a clean surface on which to put our babies food and not to have to carry dishes with us when we travel. Plus, having the matt ensures we always have a clean surface for our baby's food, and makes cleaning up and leaving very quick and easy when mealtimes are over.
+1	baby food is expensive, being able to make instant baby food from your dinner plate is awesome. especially for restaurants....just wish I had a bag to put it in when its dirty. Ziplock is useful but not reuseable. It grinds foor well with a little effort, been very happy with results on beef, chicken, brocolli, noodles, appricots. This is an affordable piece to add to your baby arsenol.
+1	Unlike many of the negative reviews, I am very happy with this item. We use it about 2-4 times a day and it's very effective and easy to use.It requires some strength to push down, but it is really minimal and takes less than 2 minutes to use for one type of food (I'm 120lbs and have very little upper body strength) and I have no trouble.[...]It's SO easy that was the first thing I was going to say... I give it a good hot rinse after I'm done with it, so the food doesn't dry up, but not much else. At night I wash (with a bristle brush) around the rubber ring and the strainer part with soap and hot water. i could put it in the dishwasher, but haven't yet because I don't think it needs it.The reason I give it 4 stars is only because the handle isn't super sturdy. It's made of plastic, which hasn't caused a problem yet (it's 3 months old) but I can't imagine I'll be using it for my grandchildren 20 years in the future.[...]
-1	Do not buy this doesn't work at all waste of money!!!  Go buy a food processor or some other type of food mill bc this is such a waste !
+1	This is a great little food mill for baby food.  I've used it for pretty much anything we normally have for meals.  It grinds to a more lumpy texture meant for babies who can handle thicker bites of food.  It doesn't puree super finely.  It's perfect for my 10 month old. I've put in rice, beans, well cooked veggies, green beans, crackers and cheese to blend together, spaghetti and sauce, etc. It's simple to use, easy to wash up and travels well because it's small.  It's good for on-the-spot meal making, not for making large batches (you could but it would take a while).  It's a great supplement to help out with making my little guy's daily meals.
+1	I would recommend this product to moms who need a way to feed their babies. I was slightly disappointed that the bowl part on top isn't a circle shape, but it is egg shaped.
-1	I had high hopes for this food mill, having purchased it after reading many reviews of this and similar products.I remember a reviewer writing that the space between the grinding disk and the bottom of the plunger was too large when fully collapsed (you push one piece into the other to push food towards the grinding disks).  This is exactly correct.  I tried to puree a small portion (1/2 a pear) and nothing came out except juice!  All the fruit was stuck below the disks.  Since my goal in getting this was the be able to puree small portions on the go it was no good for me.  I returned it.I gave it two stars because it might work better if pureeing larger portions and the components themselves seem well made albeit poorly designed.
+1	This isn't the best for babies under 6months... it doesn't get foods as smooth as the step 1 foods you buy in the store.  But keeping that in mind...This comes in very handy.  I started grinding foods in this with my 6 month old.  It is easier for me to grind some food for him right at the table so he can eat some of the things we are eating, rather than prepare and store his food in advance.I decided that one isn't enough.  I prefer to run things through the dishwasher so they are more sterilized than washing by hand and I tend to use this for two meals a day. I don't like to feel pressed to load and run the dishwasher before dinner...  It usually isn't a problem, but things are hectic at times.  Its also nice to have one clean for traveling.
+1	This is a cheap and great device. I didn't experience the 'babyfood' texture, but it is certainly adaptable to my baby's palate. make sure you feed the baby with some water too whilst eating anything you grind in this. i've tried everything from fish, veggies, and fruits (ie. watermelon, which btw didnt work:). this works very well, i didnt get the case (dont need extra weight in my pack), and i am pleased that it makes the food quickly with very little noise (my baby hates the food processor and cried whenever i ground him something in it due to noise). it is simple to assemble, diassemble, and wash.notes: diassemble with every use completely (ie. separate the grinder pieces to wash, especially if using a food prone to bacteria). in order to 'open' and 'close' the grinding device solidly and quickly into the grinder storage portion, make sure to keep the spoon handle nearby, and loosen/tighten the screw portion with blade to slide it right into the cup slots.i had an issue of not really knowing if the food is getting 'pureed' by my grinding the blades or simply pushing it through the mesh. there doesnt seem to be any discussion on this anywhere that i have found, to know if i am doing that part correctly.also the watermelon turned into fibered (slightly) watermelon juice, that was quite tasty! also you dont need a spoon for it. :)i found the longer smaller spoon nicer actuallyfor solid babyfood feeding but obviously not juicier ones like peaches. an apricot goes quite well through this. you probably want to peel your fruits and veggies before you stick them through.
+1	I've been using these for a couple of months and they work great. I have one to keep my toddler out of a couple of closets. He's pretty strong and he hasn't pulled them off.
+1	Here's the deal. If a kid wants in somewhere bad enough and has enough time to work on it, they will overcome safety features. I put this on my toddlers closet door to keep her out. After about 6 months or so she learned to push all her weight on the one side and then pull the other side toward herself. The glue did it's job! the lock stayed in place, but one of the "wings" cracked. It still does the job, but she now has it figured out. This is not really a flaw in the product, my toddler just has a way of sticking with something...
+1	Used this lock for the sliding doors on our entertainment center.  Works great.  We used it horizontally, unlike the suggested vertical method.
-1	I have been searching for a way to keep my 3-year-old out of her closet, and so I was thrilled when I found this product.  However, it won't stay on the door.  First I tried the original sticker-thing that came with it.  No luck.  Then I tried gorilla glue.  Both the "lock" and the paint came off the closet door.  My husband says he will try drilling a hole in it and attaching it to the door with a screw.IF you can get it to stay on the door, it works great.  However, good luck getting it to stay!
+1	Does exactly what it needs to.  Easy to install, locks back in place when the lid closes, and is easy to open when someone needs to use the toilet.It is also durable.  We have two in our home and recommend them to our friends.
-1	I returned this ASAP! It was AWFUL! It comes with a thick bar that you have to place the toilet seat ON TOP of! This elevates the toilet seat in the back and the only thing the seat is hanging on by is the flimsy plastic hinges of the seat!! I figured out quickly that if you sit down on the seat a few times, it will break off the hinges of your toilet seat and you'll have to buy a new seat! Whoever thought up this STUPID design did not think it through! From other reviews, I see people have already broken some seats. Sent this back and boughtMommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lokand I like it a lot better than this one!Note: NO toilet seat lock will give you a super tight seal. There's always going to be some inch or so that you will be able to open the seat, but at least your child won't drown -- maybe just some of his toys will!
+1	We've tried a couple of toilet locks and this one has worked the best so far.  It is easy to install and does make the seat sit funny like some others do.  It is easy to use as well and stay high above the toilet away from any splashing or other "unpleasantness".  This has worked very well for us and is well worth the investment to avoid toys, books and all sorts of other things going down the toilet.
+1	I love being able to pump, store, and freeze milk right in the bottle I'll be using to feed my baby. They fit the classic Avent bottles and the new natural style.
+1	I loved having all of the accessories that allowed me to pump and store breast milk directly in Avent bottles even though I didn't have an Avent Breast Pump.
+1	I bought these thinking I was going to store milk in the bottles but ultimately ended up not pumping into the avent bottles despite purchasing the converter kit for the Medela pump.  They work as promised and are good value but I am now not using them.
+1	What a great idea to be able to turn your bottle into a sealed container. I never used Avent bottles for feeding but I have an Avent breast pump and would store my milk in the bottles. These were great.
+1	At first I had to play around with them to get them fitted correctly, but pretty easy and self explanatory.
+1	Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottle Sealing Discs work on both the Classic and the Natural.  Clean easy and are slightly rubbery for a tight seal.
+1	So easy to pop these in to store the bottle and then pop out and put a nipple in its place when it's time to eat.
+1	There are 6 in this pack, the only thing I noticed is that Avent has started making these much thinner than they used to.
+1	No more spills when taking his bottles of milk, water and juice to places and no more problems with liquid waste in his bag.
+1	I was hesitant to get these because some said they did not fit the newer Avent bottles.  They fit mine perfectly.  Great storage system in general.  Can go from freezer to fridge to wherever easily without wasting milk.
+1	The listing doesn't specify that 6 do come in a package. YEA! They work wonders when you are storing your breastmilk right from pump to bottle. It has a tight seal to prevent any milk spilling and you can just add the nipple when ready to use for feeding. A must have for breastfeeding moms.
-1	These really dont do anything special. I cant find a use for them. The AVENT bottles are a great way to waste your money. Shame on Philips for guilting people into buying AVENT products. There are many many many more products that will do the same thing for 1/5 the price
+1	I bought a pack of these to use so I could freeze pumped milk right in the bottle so that all we needed to do was thaw and it was mealtime!
+1	I use this all the time when I store my milk in the refrigerator.  It does its job.
+1	I wanted the cabs to have a save close for our bottles when traveling. This happend to be the case, what makes this caps the thing I needed and wanted to have.
-1	we bought this sealing discs to store the access milk in the refrigerator but i was surprised that they don't fit the avent bottles the i bought,so we ended up  throwing them in the trash,if u wanna store milk just use the plastic bags which are cheaper and more effective.
+1	Works as expected. I use this with my extra bottles for storing pumped breast milk so that it can easily be warmed and served to baby.
+1	These were a baby shower gift along with a Avent Bottle Set. They were recommended by three different mothers which is why I purchased them.
+1	They serve their purpose. I pump directly to my PES wide neck, and I am able to store them in the ref if I will feed them to my baby that day. I can also use this to pump/store when I am out at work.
+1	these work good.  go with the bottle.  stops leaks.  you can pump out a bottle, pop one of these little babies under the screw on rim, grab a spare nipple and you are ready to go!
+1	I have Avent bottles, but not an Avent pump, so I did not get any storage bottles.  Instead of paying $25 for a storage set, these plus the bottle screw rings cost me a total of $10, and work perfectly.  I would definitely recommend to anyone pumping and using Avent bottles (I like being able to use the 9oz size for storage, because they are much larger than what my pump came with).
+1	I use these to transport bottles so no leaking. Great buy! Use these with the old event rings on the new advent bottles and no leaking :)
+1	Not sure why I bought them but if you need sealing discs these work fine with the Avent bottles.  I think I used it once to shake formula but it was a pain to then switch the nipple so I didn't use it again.  Waste of money.  I'm a first time mom that bought everything and anything.
+1	Great product from avent. I now use my old small avent bottles as containers of small stuff like hairclips etc.
+1	These work great for nursing moms. They come 6 per pack and well worth it. It makes it so much easier to store it and quickly use it again when needed
+1	These sealing discs are great for traveling. They provide your Avent bottles the perfect airtight seal with no leaks, so long as you remember to use the blue ring. All you have to do is push these through the larger white ring on your Avent bottle and once you hear a small pop, you know that it's in place. Then screw it close, it's that simple. These discs also make your bottles smaller and easier to pack in your diaper bag/cooler as well, since you don't have to use the nipple and cap. Sometimes it's just easier to pack the bottles with the discs and store the nipples/caps separately.You get a set of six per pack, which for most, is more than enough. They're easy to clean, don't stain or warp, and store easily too. So long as you don't forget to use the blue ring on your bottle and properly use the discs, these sealing discs won't leak out any milk.This is a good buy if you can get it on sale on the site, otherwise look elsewhere for a better price. It's great for parents who are on the go and are looking to store baby bottles more efficently.
+1	They do what is intended and it's nice to have spares around the house just in case one is lost.
+1	I've lost several bottles of milk thanks  to leaking through the nipples.  These are a must when traveling with pumped milk!  No leaks so far.
+1	It does what it says.  My avent bottles are travel ready with these discs.If you have Avent bottles, these are a must.
-1	I have to agree with the other reviewers about this being more toy like than serious potty training.  My daughter loves sticking her hand in the bowl to make it play the song and she loves taking the bowl out.  There are times when she doesn't go and the music goes off which is confusing.  I will probably buy another one just so she can distinguish the difference.  Once she figured out she could make it play without going potty she quit using it.
+1	I used this with my daughter. The only time it leaked was when it wasn't snapped in right. We never used the music (was thinking it wouldn't be beneficial and she'd want to put toys in it to make the music go).It was a lot easier to clean that our other potty chair. There's a little 'trick' (if you can call it that) to unsnap it before pulling it out instead of just pulling it all the way at once.Lightweight but sturdy. It has a back which feels more like a real potty.And she had no problems sitting on it.Obviously, we never used the pee guard (which is easily removable).
+1	Our daughter started fighting the diapers when she was only 6-7 months old, so in a fit of desperation, I bought this potty, put her on it and never looked back. It helped that the potty was really comfortable, with a wide, flat bottom that left no marks on her tush, and stable enough so there were no accidents.I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky. Ah, and the music never worked (no loss in my opinion, I was there to do the encouraging) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy. A toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting, which may lead to a whole new set of problems. But overall, this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training, that I cannot but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic!
-1	do not buy this potty chair simply for the "bells and whistles"  they never seem to work at the right time - or at all half of the time.  I would have liked to see it be a little deeper as far as size goes, my boys had a little trouble squeezing in when the protector was on.  The main thing that annoys me and maybe this only happens with boys, but it occasionally leaks underneath between the bowl and where it slides in.  I am guessing that since the boys urine comes out the front, rather than underneath, it leaks out in that space where the bowl slides out.  There are even times that my older son's pants got wet from resting at the front of the potty when he sat.  If I had to do it all again, I would opt for using the big potty from the start - cleaning those things out gets old fast too!
+1	I have to say that sassy makes some of the best infant toys and teething toys. My son had all of these toys that come in the pack and he loved them, unfortunately when i my son was a baby they didnt sell all of them in one pack, i had to buy them seperately, so if you buy this pack you will save some money.
+1	Looking at baby toys is so overwhelming. This set has all you need (of course you'll end up buying more toys, but really this is all you need!). The toys are high-quality, colorful, and they encourage exploration in play. I highly recommend this set.
+1	My triplets, who are very different, loved these when they were babies. We didn't have the entire set but did have most of the items. This brand and these items are durable, bright colored, fun, wonderful toys so learn with and have loads of fun!
+1	I bought this set before my son was born and couldn't wait to show him all of the bright, colorful toys.  When he was a few weeks old, we held the rattles in front of him, and he stared at them in amazement.  Eventually he learned to hold and shake them on his own, and then he discovered the other toys.  He fell in love with the yellow and purple jingle ball, and he would have lots of fun shaking it and rolling it across the floor.  The teethers are nicely textured, and the linking letters are fun to dangle from an activity gym.  Also, my son loves the little yellow rubber ducky and the purple octopus.  I squirt him with them during bath time, and he laughs and squeals.  Of all the toys we now own, many of his favorites are from the original Sassy set.  This toy set has been wonderful, and I would highly recommend it to other parents.  Not only are the toys designed with bright, high-contrast patterns to please young infants, but also they are varied and durable enough to please older babies.  This truly is a great assortment of baby toys.
+1	I am happy with the total package.  There are a number of things that go with the various stages of our baby's development, and overall I beleive the price works out more economical than purchasing individual toys.
+1	this item is great for putting on tables at fast food restaurants.
+1	I admit it--I'm one of "those" parents who wipes down the restaurant highchair and the table with antibacterial wipes before my child sits down.  I still do that even with these placemats, but these definitely make me more comfortable about having my toddler eat off restaurant tables.We have used these in countless restaurants and have been quite pleased.  We have found that they don't stick well to all tables, but I suppose that is to be expected.  Use care when removing these placemats from wooden tables because we did remove a bit of finish from one table...oopsie!  Also, our most recent batch of Table Toppers seems a bit faulty--the sticky substance on the bottom edge of the placemats is too far from the edge of the mat--leaving about 1.5 inches of loose placemat at the bottom of the mat...very tempting for our toddler to tug on!!We always buy our daughter the Sesame Street Table Toppers and now she asks for Elmo and Zoe when she is ready to start eating at a restaurant.  Such a great invention and definitely one I wish I had thought of!!  :)
-1	My son also rips these right off the table.  He is almost 11 months old so hopefully he will do better with them when he is older (fortunately I only bought the 20 pack).  This is a great idea in theory but for my curious son it is not practical.  I am back to using my antibacterial wipes to clean the table off which is the only effective method that I have found so far.Update: I have recently found two alternatives of this same concept that have worked out well.  The local Dollar Tree sells their own version of table toppers that cling quite well (pack of 8 for $1) and the Hippopatamus brand that Target sells that have great educational themes of ABCS and numbers 1-10.  These wrap around the edge of the table and cover more area than the previously reviewed brand.
+1	My son is 17 months old and we just saw these last week at a friend's house and then at the National Building Museum's playroom for kids. These are incredibly great! He now has 4 and we are very happy!
+1	They are cute, semi-soft and perfect size for little hands. They also make a nice sound while propelling themselves! My 14 months old likes them very much, and I think he will play more and more with them!
+1	These little cars are so cute! The size is perfect (not tiny, like a matchbox car) they're big, but not too big. Easy for the little one to figure out - just pull the car backwards and they zip across the floor (my son loves when they crash into something and I say "boom!"). Or they could just roll them forward, at their own speed. Highly recommended - lots of fun! I like that they are soft and easy to clean too - just give them a good wipe. A good toy to take along on an outing or trip.
+1	really loved the product, was just perfect on my daughter, looked good and daughter loved it.nice qualitywill always recommend buying from this store
+1	I wanted to try a Boppy but was tired of paying full price for name-brand items that might or might not work for my (first) son. My husband likes this thing even more than I do. He was helping with midnight feedings of expressed milk but the baby was hurting his back in the middle of the night. Now he uses the Cuddle-U to help secure the son for feedings.There are definite downsides, though: The cover does not come off, which makes cleanings tricky. Some would surely consider it worth it to pay more for a removable cover. Also, I don't see this growing with my little guy much. It's not secure enough to support him in a sitting position, so I imagine he'll be done with this by 3-4 months. For the price, it will have lasted long enough.
+1	I purchased this while pregnant because I could not see spending $40 for a Boppy.  I was not able to use this as a nursing pillow because it was too bulky for me, but I did use it for tummy time when my son was a newborn.  He is now 10 months old and I use it for play time, I plop him down on it, let him crawl over it, etc.  I never used the strap because it is a U shaped pillow and is already self-containing so I don't know why you need a strap?  Anyway, there is a pouch for the strap to go in and my son makes a game out of pulling it out after I tuck it away.  Overall, I like this pillow and I would recommend it for anyone interested in a Boppy.  I do have to say that I purchased my pillow at Wal-Mart for about $20 and it has a brightly colored jungle theme, so I cannot comment on the specific color/style being sold on Amazon.
+1	I liked this pillow it was exactly as pictured and stated. So soft! I would recommend this to my friends.
+1	Even so I am not nursing, I got this pillow and will help a lot when holding the baby because of my incision.
+1	Our couch is made out of the fake leather so when we sit our son on the couch using his regular Boppy he slowly slips down.  With this cover we can either put him in the cover like pictured or kind of put it under his butt.  The cover is ESSENTIAL to our lives!!!  We use the sling part in a different way than pictured...we use it under his bum as a sling to keep him from sliding down (when he was smaller his feet would rest on the inside of the sling).  And now that he is trying to sit up more we have enjoyed just slipping the sling under the pillow during those times that he'd prefer to work on sitting.  I know that it warns against having a baby sleep in the pillow, but with the sling keeping him from sliding down, we feel much more comfortable letting hiim sleep in the pillow.  Our son loves it!
+1	When my baby was a born I used this pillow constantly! Since you can not take the cover off, I always put a blanket over it. I've spot cleaned it, but it does kinda suck that I can just put it in the wash every once in a while. I am not a crazy germaphobe and with the blanket over it, he never really spit up on it or anything. Before he was mobile he was always lying in his pillow. I will say it's not very good at propping my baby up as he is learning to sit up, he just tumbles over. So as of right now, I use it more as a back cushion. He still nurses but we never use it anymore for that.
+1	I love this pillow! It's size is great and my son loves to sleep in it. It gives him the feeling of being held and he just loves it. It's great for us parents because we can put him in it and he can sit with us on the couch or on the bed.
-1	I've been using this to nurse but I hate the fact the cover does not come off so you can't throw it in the wash if milk gets on it. My son recently had a dirty (poop) diaper leak (not a big leak, like a drop or two), and I don't feel like I can spot clean it well enough to ever put my son on it again. I don't use it to set him in like the picture shows because he has a gym, swing, and bouncer for times I need to put him down. I have used it for tummy time to help his neck muscles. He's 7 weeks old. I wish it was at least water resistant since there is no cover to remove.
+1	This is by far the most used single item I bought for the baby. She loves to hang out in this so she can see the world.
+1	Great pillow, my LO still naps in it, makes her feel &#34;hugged&#34;. She falls asleep easily in it, wish the Velcro straps could be longer to secure bigger baby.
+1	Similar to a Boppy, but the extra strap is neat if you want to sit your child in it. And it is great for breastfeeding support. I wouldn't go without it.
+1	It was a good deal with the covering with it and it was nice and plump. Yes will be telling friends and family.  The price was good for Ive paid more for them before.
+1	I have twin babies, so I got two of these for them to lay in. The fact that it has a &#34;seat belt&#34; helped them stay put and not slide down. While it would have been nice to have a cover for it, I instead used a thin blanket between the pillow and the baby. The blanket even created less of a hole for the baby to slide through. In the first 3 months, my babies had pretty bad reflux, so they slept in this. It kept them elevated, and cozy (like mommy or daddy had their arms around them). As soon as my babies started being able to roll over on their own, their reflux also improved, so I was able to graduate them to their cribs (one baby likes to roll to her side to sleep, while the other one rolls over onto to her tummy) within less than a week. I never used these as nursing pillows because it's just too big for me (I'm 5 feet), but I'll be taking the pillows out again when my babies start sitting up on their own (to provide a cushion for when they fall over). I would definitely purchase again.
+1	I have really enjoyed having this item. When my infant was having trouble sleeping on her back because of acid reflux this pillow saved me. I have used the same pillow for my second daughter as well. It said it couldn't be washed and I thought that was gross to just spot clean. I washed it in my high efficiency washer and it came out just fine. I run a daycare now and have bought a second one for the other infant in my care. Neither of my daughters have slipped around in it, it holds them firmly in place. Now that my daughter is learning to sit up I put her in it and she sits up and plays but if she falls over the pillow catches her. I have owned this for a year and a half and I have no rips in it. It is also great for when they get a cold. It sits them up enough to let the mucas flow instead of clogging them up.
+1	Baby loves to chill on this. Its great for tummy time and also used to hold baby while breastfeeding or bottle feeding.
+1	I love this pillow. I had a Boppy for my first 2 boys. It was ok, but my husband had a hard time putting it around his waist to feed the babies. I decided to buy the Le'Cuddler for our 3rd boy. This has been a great investment, not only for the baby but for me as well. While 6 mos. pregnant I trip down a set of concrete steps landing on my butt bone, I think I broke it. My Dr. advisedme to get a donut pillow. So, I figured, since I wanted a new nursing pillow, why not use this for myself temporarily. It is softer and squishier than the Boppy (the Boppy was kinda hard for my babies heads)and can fit better around the adult's belly. I love that is has a velcro strap for the baby when he is still too young to sit up. The pattern is nice for either gender, so it works out good for our son. The one thing I miss is the removable washable cover, this pillow either has to be spot cleaned or put on the gentle cycle in the wash. Overall, I wish I bought this years ago for my first 2 babies.
+1	I purchased a Boppy pillow because I am a nursing mom and needed the support.  Unfortunately I found that my daughter would roll around and could not get comfortable or stay in one place to nurse unles she was perfectly placed on it.  This pillow is great!  It is so comfortable and I don't worry about my daughter (1 month) wiggling out of it or ending up slumped over on it.  If you're a nursing mom consider this before a Boppy!  It is much softer and baby will stay put without rolling around. (I am glad I bought the Boppy with the gym, it wasn't a total waste!)  My two year old daughter also loves to snuggle with this pillow and I find myself doing the same!  In my opinion it is definately worth the money.Note- My daughter is now almost three months old and we still use this every day... it is as great as the day we got it, it really holds up!  I only wish it came with a cover!  (It is recommended that you only spot clean this pillow, washing it will make it lumpy... yuck!)  However, I had one made fairly inexpensive at our dry cleaner... we just brought in the fabric and pillow and now we just toss that into the wash when needed.  Still very happy with this pillow!
+1	I have yet to try it out with an actual baby, but the size and shape are far superior to other nursing pillows I have seen.  The pattern is cute and gender neutral.  I will update once the baby gets a chance to try it!
-1	I've had two of these and two Boppy brand pillows. These are about half the price, are firmer, thicker and sturdier.  I like that baby is boosted up a little bit higher and that the pillow doesn't go flat over the course of a year of breast feeding!****Update:  baby arrived three weeks ago and I was happy with my pillow until the first big spit up.  That's when I realized this pillow had no cover, unlike previous versions. Yucky.  Then,  last week, he seams began unravelling,  this is NOT the same quality pillow I purchased faux years ago for kid #1.  Can't return it since the window is expired but will be trying to call customer supports or Leachco.
+1	My granddaughter is expecting my first great-granddaughter in a couple of weeks and she had this on her wish list.  She was so happy when I gave it to her at her baby shower.  Said she had researched a bunch of them and this was the one that she thought was the best.
+1	My baby loves this! He sleeps in it most nights, and it fits into our sidecar co sleeper (the Arms Reach full size) if I want a little more room in bed. I am glad it has the support strap even though it looks a little silly. I tried it one night without it and he slid down too far. This is great for babies who like to be reclined vs lying flat, and this position is actually more beneficial to young ones' spinal development. It's also a great nursing pillow, more comfortable than the Brest Friend which I had been using before.
+1	I liked this product because unlike the Boppy this has the flap in the front that prevents the baby from sliding down.  Also, it would be nice if they had more attractive fabric/cover choices and the cover was removable like the Boppy.
+1	I'm very happy with the purchase but just a heads up for everyone.#1 - the pillow fits only small size mom (works for us).#2 - the white cotton (or whatever material inside the donut) comes out from the surface once in a while. We have to clean up the little cotton mess on our bed. It's not too serious but it happens. You will see little string sticking out from the donut, don't pull it as it will get worst.#3 - to keep it clean, make a cover for it or use it with a towel on top. Due to the losing cotton problem I mentioned above, I doubt it's safe to wash in a washer.
+1	I like this- even if your baby isn't a chunk when he or she is born, eventually he or she gets pretty heavy on your arm when you are nursing, so this pillow comes in handy. My DH and I also use this for photos- we drape a sheet over this and our newborn is properly propped up for pics!
+1	Great delivery time! I choose this pillow over boppy every time because of the straps it has for baby to be secure, it's multifunctional.
+1	This really helped me keep my posture while breastfeeding. My baby loves sleeping on this while I have him on my lap, it's that soft and comfortable for him. My only complaint is that two months after we started using it, the filling started pushing through the cover. I keep finding bits of it on my baby's face and it's becoming annoying. I haven't washed this, only spot cleaned the areas that need it. I always use a swaddle blanket to protect it from spit ups and drool but it would have been nicer if it had a cover in the first place. Still, we use this everyday so I'm giving it a 4.
+1	Haven't gotten to use this too much.  It is a less expensive boppy pillow.  When having to buy everything for a new baby cost is always something to look at.  I like the color and that it has the strap.  I remember having to constantly have to adjust my first child because he had slipped down the boppy.  I found the downside quickly though with the first diaper explosion.  The cover doesn't come off to wash. It says you can machine wash the whole thing, I guess we will see how that goes.
+1	this pillow is cheaper and more functional than the boppy! my son loved this pillow and the sling was really helpful
+1	I bought one of these after my daughter was born to replace the My Brest Friend (which was terrible).  I love it and so does my baby.  We are still using it 9 months later.  So when my sister in law had her baby shower I knew she had to have one.  The Velcro safety strap is a great bonus.  Except this one doesn't have a removable cover for washing and the one I purchased for myself did, so I left out a star for that.
+1	We purchased this Leachco Cuddle-U - Pillow for and our granddaughter and she just loves it.
+1	My daughter-in-law loves this...even used it to lean her 2-week old for his first baby shoot.  We looked at two other brands, which this one matches in features and THIS one was HALF the price.  I thought it was a pricing error initially.
+1	This pillow is great!  We use it every day.  It's a versatile pillow...can be used for tummy time and it aids if you are nursing, but mainly we use it as a seat/back rest.  My daughter is 3 months old and we just strap her in and she can sit upright.  It allows us to interact with her without having to hold her 24/7 and gives your arms a break!  My daughter takes naps on it all the time and I don't have to worry that she might fall out of it because the velcro straps keep her very snug and secure.  This pillow has been a godsend for the times that my daughter isn't interested in her toys and doesn't want to be held, but still wants attention and to be near us.
+1	It's comfy for my daughter to hang out in.  I like it is a nursing pillow too.  Love the cute pink polka dot pattern.  Love the under $20 price.  Wish it had a removable, washable cover.
+1	I love this pillow and so does my son, i don't know why everyone is so hung up on the bobby pillow, this nursing pillow is great, and it's so cute, and cheaper if memory serves me correctly! My son as I write this review is sleeping in it now, he actually can't sleep soundly without it! and the color and the print is so beautiful and lively, it's my favorite item that I got for him, I might even like it more than he does :D lolThe only problem and I wish I could get someone to help me with this, is how to use the little strap that supposed to hold the baby still lol for the life of me I can't figure it out, I think it's only me though, I see everyone else with their pictures, now I'm not saying it's hard to set it up or anything, but the velcro doesn't match up, the strap is horizontal and the part where it supposed to latch on is vertical so I'm not sure if I supposed to ignore that or if it doesn't supposed to come that way everyone has one that matches up correctly and I'm the one with a defective one lmao but anyway it's not even a big deal because it still works and I'm still more than in love with this pillow definitely 5 stars
+1	This pillow really helps when breast feeding and provides a lot of support to both me and the baby. The only thing is it slips out of place quite easily. Other than that, it's absolutely great.
+1	When it arrived I know I am satisfied with this pillow. It soft & thick. I like the purpose of the belt too. It is added for baby's support & safety. Unfortunately, there is no cover sheet available. Just wipe it with wet cloth & you will be fine.
+1	I bought this pillow because I didn't want to shell out the money for a boppy.  This pillow is wonderful!!  I use it everytime I breastfeed.  I also use it to keep the baby in place, just like in the picture.  This particular pillow does not come with a removable cover. They sell covers separately. If it gets dirty, you have to wash the whole thing, or spot clean it. This is a great nursing pillow for the price!!
+1	This has helped me tons in combing her hair as it allows her to not move around too much; don't get me wrong she still manages to turn here and there (smiles) but it keeps her somewhat in one place. I would make the back a little higher so that she can not be too reclined and more upright to explore her surroundings.
+1	With previous children who hated sleeping on their backs, I used an old boppy to cuddle around them, but that only worked until they could wiggle around too much for it to be safe. Now I see this style, which is a great idea. One thing I noticed- most people complained about there being no washable cover. Walmart offers one that does say it has one, so you might want to check that one out too. I think it comes in Jungle print.
-1	Though the material is nice and it arrived promptly, I did no enjoy this particular brand. It was uncomfortable to wear and it became easier to use a normal livingroom/bedroom pillow to help with the feeding.
+1	I had the same for my first kid and i am buying another one since it is super comfortable to breastfeed and safe to put baby ,the strap is lil big for newborn but will be good after a while
+1	I use every day. More so for the baby to sit than for nursing. The strap is also very useful, something that a Boppy doesn't have.
+1	I just had twins...so I've been trying to find ways to find time.  I got two of these pillows.  I can put a baby in each to bottle feed, and pump at the same time.  These pillows are great!  And it's great that they are made in the USA!
+1	Still not using it but looks great.if u have big b.., don't use it for breastfeeding. I think it's made for women who have small boobs.
+1	I love using this pillow for daytime breastfeeding. It's comfy for baby and me, and it gets baby in a convenient football-hold nursing position.I also have a My Breast Friend nursing pillow, and I prefer the My Breast Friend for nighttime feedings, as I've found it's a little bit easier to soothe baby to sleep afterwards when he's lying on that more solid cushion.Baby is only 2 months old, but I've already put him in the seated position using this cushion, because he can already hold his head pretty steady and upright, and he really likes it, but since he's so little, I would never put him in in without me being directly next to him and paying attention the whole time, because even with the strap, he can slide into awkward positions just because he's still little and can't hold his head steady for too long, or at all once he's sleepy.I struggle with plugged ducts and mastitis, and using BOTH these cushions lets me get baby into a variety of nursing positions, which decreases the likelihood of plugged ducts, and makes it easier to empty the breast fully whenever I do have a plugged duct.
+1	Boppy can suck it! I love this thing! My sister is a skinny little thing and had the boppy for her son. She said she needed one or two more for it to be actually useful for breastfeeding because it was such a low profile pillow. She tried taking this one when she tried it and she's not evening bfing anymore! Works great for my little one, She enjoys it for nursing, napping on and now her sitting up endeavors! I am a VERY plus sized mom, I wear a 26 dress and this fits me just fine! That boppy never would've wrapped around me!
+1	I bought these to replace my leaking Avent bottles.  I've been using them a 4 months and I've not had any problems.  No leaks.  However I wish they made more rate flow nipples the #2's are too slow so I pokeed 4 more holes in them. Now my daughter drinks her bottle quickly instead of sucking for 15 mins and getting a red face.
+1	These bottles work well. They do their job, as designed, and reduce gas. In fact I very often try to burp my baby for several minutes and nothing happens. Spit up is greatly reduced as well.There are a lot of of parts, but they are easy to clean, albeit a bit tedious (but easier than some other bottles). I typically wash them by hand and I'm a little leery of washing them by dishwasher, I'm not sure if they'll get thoroughly clean if I leave the bottom assembled and I don't want to fish the small parts off the bottom of the dishwasher if I disassemble them.The slow nipples seemed to work best for my son. The fast made him sputter and make a mess. (Be sure to note which nipples you are using, the speed is imprinted on the nipple, and is easy to overlook).Overall, I like these bottles very much. They work well, and are more affordable compared to some of the other high end bottles.
+1	I have tried out several different bottles with my son and I absolutely love this one it is easy for him to grab a hold of and I see no gassiness.  My favorite factor is this bottle is the easieast bottle I have ever had the pleasure of washing it comes apart easily and washes easily.  I love it and my son has developed a preference for it.
-1	Our 12 week old became so frustrated while using these bottles because the nipples would constantly collapse.  The directions instruct you not to use an electric warmer or sterilizer.  With a total of 6 parts per bottle cleaning, warming and sterilizing are completely inconvenient.  I'd suggest buying an individual bottle to try it out first.  In our case, these bottles weren't worth the money.
+1	work great but a pain to clean. my daughter lovers them though
+1	I used these bottles for my baby until she was about 5 weeks old.  Everybody complains that the Stage 1 nipple flow is way too slow.  It is, but that was a plus for my baby, because she is very prone to spitting up.  I found that these bottles were slow enough that it made her keep everything down.  I tried the Dr. Brown's bottles at first, and they were way too fast and made her spit up very badly.  So I went back to the Vent Aire bottle, and my baby kept all formula down at every feeding.However, now that my baby is getting older and demanding more formula at each feeding, these bottles just don't work for us any more.  It was taking my baby 45 minutes or more to take 3 oz. of formula, which was driving me crazy at 2:00 a.m.  It was taking so long for my baby to eat that she was becoming disinterested in eating only 1 oz into a feeding, then she would just do the &quot;non nutritive suckles&quot; on the nipple without taking in formula.  It was so frustrating, because I know she was still hungry, but she was using the nipple like a pacifier because the flow was soooooo slow!  They were also giving my baby nursing blisters on her lips from having to suck so hard to get the formula out.I recommend these bottles for the first month, then after that, switch to a different bottle, or switch to a different brand of Stage 1 nipple (even though they say to only use the Vent Aire nipples).  The Stage 2 nipples are way too fast, it seems like there is no in between with these Vent Aire nipples.  I recommend the EvenFlo Stage 1 nipple.
-1	I don't know if I like these or not.  I have several and have been using them since my son was born four months ago.The formula doesn't come out the way all of the books say it's supposed to, about a drop per second.  Actually, nothing comes out unless you milk the nipple, or more obviously, if the baby is sucking on it.  I did try using the second stage nipple and the formula comes out far to fast and my son won't have anything to do with it at this point...perhaps when he's older he can handle the rate of flow for the stage 2 nipple.One of the design flaws is the round silicone insert that eliminates the air in the bottle.  If you don't put it in properly after washing, the formula will leak from the bottom of the bottle.  It also seems that when it is in correctly, occasionally it creates some sort of seal or pressure, and the formula won't come out of the bottle at all.I still use them because I have them, and they do serve their purpose.  However, if I had the opportunity to buy new bottles, I would definitely go with Dr. Brown's instead.
+1	I tried every bottle imaginable for my daughter. She started at 3 weeks after i tried breast feeding. There were problems with all the other bottles....such as leaking, having to buy liners all the time, unmarked nipples, suction, etc. Once i tried these bottles, we were home free! They are easy to sterilize, use and clean. I like the angle of the bottle. But the best part are the clearly marked nipples. My daughter had to have rice cereal added to her formula and these nipples are clearly marked Stage 1 (Slow flow, formula only for infants) and Stage 2 (Fast flow, for cereal and/or older babies). All the other nipples i tried with other bottles weren't marked so i had no idea which ones were slow flow and fast flow after i had sterilized them all. I had no problems at all with these bottles and i would highly recommend them. In fact i bought extra sets to leave at the grandparent's houses!
+1	I recieved a couple of different sized boxes of these bottles from my baby shower. I love them, however, my daughter had been sucking on her bottle for a couple of hours before I realized nothing was coming out. About 4 of the nipples I recieved wouldn't allow anything through them, even when I tried.
+1	These bottles are great.  My son is 2 1/2 month old and hasn't had any gas bubble that much.  He drinks very good with these bottle.  Just have to remember to put the plastic part down and around on the bottom part of it will leak!
-1	these bottles are not worth the money.. they are so complicated to put together and they always leak. my daughter could not drink one bottle without spilling the formula out of the sides. please think about using another bottle, I suggest dr browns , i threw away all my ventaire once i purchased the dr browns bottles &#62; they are definitely the best on the market.
+1	This set contain all the bottle that you need for the first six months. good product and I had been use this over six months. Highly recommend to other first time mom.
-1	These are no where near the same quality as the Playtex VentAire Wide Bottle. I thought they were at least in the same family but I was completely wrong. The universal nipples that Playtex makes for all their bottles do not fit on these bottles. Also there are no meterings on the side so there's no way to know how much milk is in the bottle. These were so far from what we wanted we didn't even use them and ended up donating them to charity.However, you don't have to look too far to find the perfect bottle and they are somewhat related. The Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set is exactly what you want. They are so good in fact we went back and bought another set.ALSO BUYER BEWARE EVEN THOUGH WE NEVER USED THESE BOTTLES AMAZON WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO RETURN THEM!
+1	My son is one big ball of gas. We loved the Advent bottles but they didn't help with his gas problem. These bottles are great for babies who don't need any more air in their tummys. Also the nipples are great for babies that used to the breast, or babies that are between the breast and bottle.The newborn gift set gets you going with all the bottles you will need to start things out plus some for when baby starts getting older.No air in belly, price is not over the top, nipples are the best I have found, and very well made (no leaks at all)
+1	My son loves his sleep sacks! these are so nice and warm and very large so the child can grow without replacing them all the time! we love our sleep sacks!
+1	I bought this for my 8 month old, because at night he kept taking off his blanket and he would get cold and wake up. The first night that he used his Sleepsack, he slept through the night and woke up very happy!!If I would've known about this product earlier, I would've bought it when he was born!!
+1	I was a nanny before a mom.  The babies and toddlers I cared for had these fleece Halo sleep sacks and so I ordered one for my baby after she no longer wanted to be swaddled. I like that these are generous around the hips and leg area - you don't want to restrict that area too much for growth and development reasons. I also like that they are sleeveless so the baby's temperature is more comfortable. However, I realized once my baby wore her fleece sleep sack (with just a long sleeve onesie) that it was too hot for her in our home. Our California home stays between 70 and 72 degrees in winter, we don't use the heater and she sleeps in her bassinet on a cotton sheet. This is a good sleep sack if your baby or todler's room is drafty and cool or perhaps if you live in a colder climate than we do. The sack can take many washes and will last a long time. Zipper opens from top and bottom. I think I will order a cotton sack to replace the fleece sack. For an idea on sizing - my baby is 7 weeks old, 22.5 inches long, 11.5lbs - I ordered the small and it is long and wide enough or her with lots of room to grow.
+1	I absolutely love this product. We have several of them and use them every night. My only negative is the price. I bought two of these and then found them in new condition for $3.50 at our local kid's clothing resale shop. Needless to say, I will be checking there first from now on.
+1	I have used Halo Sleep Sacks from the time my son was born, and I loved the fact that there were no loose blankets in his crib. Most babies kick their legs in their sleep, and they can't kick off this blanket! . He is only 4 months old, but a big and long baby, so when he grew out of cotton infant size Halo, I ordered 2 fleece blankets in XL. They are perfect- warm and extra long, with large arm holes, so he can grow into the length. Hopefully they will still fit  next winter. The fleece is warm, so the layer underneath should be light. The color is adorable, and I love that the zipper unzips from the bottom, making the night time diaper changes easy.
+1	I transitioned my son to the HALO sleep sack when he was 4 months old and he did great! We were swaddling him before and found it to be an easy transition. The sleep sack has a v-neck top so that it is not to close to baby's face. My baby does check on the bottom sometimes when he is rolling around his bed. The material has become a little frayed from washing it a lot but overall it's a great product!
+1	Excellent product. She can't kick it off like a normal blanket. Love how the zipper zips up from the bottom, making night time diaper changes a breeze. The fleece is soft and warm, sometimes too warm. If you buy one, it wouldn't hurt to buy the fleece one AND a cotton one for warmer nights.
+1	This fleece was a little lighter than some, so it's perfect for when it's chilly but not freezing in the room.  We love the sleepsacks, because our now-one-year-old is a very active sleeper.  She'd never keep a blanket on, but with this, she's always warm enough.
+1	We have at least five different sleeping sack.  This time order is  for baby shower gift to a friend. Wonderful design, easy to clean, keep our baby nice and warm.
+1	Me and baby love this wearable blanket. It's really soft and warm, perfect for the winter. Baby has been using it since he was 2 months old, after I stopped swaddling him. He is now 7 months and can roll and even crawl in the crib freely wearing this blanket. It was a great purchase!!!!
-1	I bought this b/c I have 2 other Halo sacks which I loved but were more expensive. There's a reason for difference in price - material not as soft and the zipper separates. Poor quality.
+1	These are the safest way to keep your baby covered in their crib. No loose bedding but keeps them warm. A must!
+1	Wonderful blanket that keeps baby warm and safe all night. I worried baby would have a had time moving and get tangled, but we haven't had a problem yet. Baby has been using the HALO sacks since birth and we couldn't be happier. There are different materials to accommodate different temperatures and the zipper really does make a difference when changing a sleeping baby's diaper. Constantly recommending these to my friends.
+1	In what ended up being one of the best decisions we made in terms of product purchases since becoming parents, my wife and I discovered the glory of the HALO SleepSacks when we bought the newborn sized ones with the built in velcro swaddle. The swaddlers sleepsacks took the headache, hassle, and difficulty out of swaddling. We were sold and have been buying SleepSack products in larger and larger sizes as our son grows up.He has slept in a HALO SleepSack product every single cool or cold night since the day he was born. They are extremely high quality, they hold up perfectly wash after wash. He looks comfortable and sleeps soundly while wearing this sleepsack. We have this micro-fleece version for the coldest nights, and the thinner cotton versions for the more mild nights. The design of these SleepSacks is incredible. The SleepSacks zip from the top on down, keeping the zipper at the bottom of the SleepSack where your child cannot easily find it and unzip it, and it also won't be a bother for children who sleep on their stomachs. And it's nice knowing that this product is much safer and provides way more peace of mind than putting a blanket in the crib.This particular one now marks the sixth HALO product we have purchased in the first 14 months of our sons life. We will no doubt be purchasing the larger sizes as he grows, and are sold for life.
+1	I thought our daughter would get too warm in warm pajamas (fleece) and this fleece Halo. However, the Halo is just warm enough... it's pretty thin, but still warm. We only use Halo blankets. They're great.
+1	It is really a great idea this speepSack. I do not have to worry of SIDS with my newborn. I really recommend this product.
+1	We have had our son in Halo sleepsacks ever since we stopped swaddling him. They are great! We've had cotton, velboa and this fleece one. The fleece is warm and moderately thick, but I think the velboa is the softest and thickest Halo sleepsack. It's difficult to tell whether the fleece or the velboa is warmer. I wish the sleepsacks were more widely available in the larger sizes. We're going to keep my son in them as long as we can. He moves around too much in his sleep to use an actual blanket. Seriously, he's rolling all over the place all night.The one thing I think these sleepsacks are missing is a snap tab that would cover the zipper. We've actually talked about sewing one on because our son has become very interested in unzipping his sleepsack to the point where it has kept him awake trying to unzip. Our nephew went through a similar stage when he was obsessed with the sleepsack zipper so I'm thinking it might be a common thing. I understand that you wouldn't need the snap for really young babies, but it might be good for toddler sizes.Overall, we love these and will continue to put our son in them until he'll no longer fit!
+1	These are fantastic. We have twin boys and we use these sleep sacks every night. I use them for bed with a long sleeve onesie, they sleep comfortably and warm.
+1	Soft and warm, easy to wear .But after my baby can and likes to stand up, I stop using it since he may trip over. I will use it again when he can stand more steadily.
+1	I love these sleep sacks. They keep my baby snuggly warm and I don't have to worry about a blanket which might fall over and cover his mouth. Highly recommend.
+1	Soft, cozy, and perfect for winter. My son has been using the SleepSack since he was born. We moved onto the Early Walker but, it's too cold now to have his feet exposed. He loves this blanket so much that when he's tired, he'll drag his blanket to the couch and lay down holding it which lets us know that he is ready for bed. SleepSacks are a must have for every child.
-1	I like that this garment is flame resistant, that it is spacious and sleeveless, but that's about it.  The fabric has an unpleasant feel and the zipper began to break after only one use.  It continually splits from the wrong end, so every time the baby wakes up, she's come out of it.  I regret this purchase.
+1	I can not say enough about Halo sleep sacks! We are now on our second child and I couldn't live without them. Niether one liked to be swaddled, so this is a safe way to make sure that they stay warm and comfy!
+1	This is a super cute SleepSack and really keeps my 18mos warm.  Her room is so cold and this definitely takes the chill away!
+1	I would probably make some without holes for arms.  The kids also throw arms around and wake themselves up.
+1	We have tried so many different sleeping bags but have found the Halo SleepSack to be the best. Bub sleeps like a dream all year round in these.
+1	Its nice knowing she won't kick off her covers... or when the time comes that it will help keep her from climbing out of her crib. Excellent quality.  And I love that the zippers zip backwards to make middle of the night diaper changes easy.
+1	We have used these since day one with our darling daughter.  She has had every size and is now 21 months.  We never worry about her kicking off her blankets and getting cold.  We know she is always protected and snugly.  Great product and worth every penny!
+1	I have a large one-year-old - in the 90th percentile, and this fits him perfectly. It's been great for winter and has kept him toasty with some fleece footie pajamas underneath. I highly recommend all HALO sleepsacks. The material is soft and the zipper is easy to pull up and down. Big thumbs up!
+1	There are many ways to reduce the risk of SIDS, the most important being to place the baby on his or her back to sleep. Another way is to put your baby in a wearable blanket at sleep time, which eliminates the need for loose blankets in the crib.  Halo SleepSacks have embraced the slogan "Back is Best," featuring it on many of their products.  They have a video and list of Safe Sleep tips from Dr. Tanya Altmann featured on their website, which is full of great information.  Go check it out!I choose to put Lily in a SleepSack for her general safety, but especially because she tosses and turns in her sleep. When we used a light loose blanket to cover her during the warm summer months, there were times when she woke up because she couldn't turn over without getting tangled. This has caused sleep disruptions for the whole family, even the dog! And the last thing I want is for her to get a loose blanket bunched up in her face while she sleeps.I love the Halo SleepSack design because the zipper starts at the top and zips down, leaving the zipper pull at Lily's feet instead of up near her face.  This feature makes for easier diaper changes, and also allows us to let her legs out without removing the SleepSack completely if we need to put her in the jumper for an extra few minutes to tire her out at bedtime. The arm holes are appropriately sized to keep her from getting her arm inside the sack accidentally, but the sack is roomy and gives her plenty of room to kick her legs (which she likes to do first thing in the morning to alert us that she's awake). And the best part, Lily is able to roll over without getting tangled, meaning better sleep for all! Phineas is a happy puppy.Keep in mind, Lily is 10 months old, so she rolls over freely and chooses to sleep on her tummy. I put her "Back to Sleep" until she started turning on her own in the middle of the night.
+1	I have these in several colors and designs for my 14 month old son and have since he was 3 months (in varying sizes). I like that it keeps him warm without the need for a blanket, and he seems to prefer the fleece to the cotton.
+1	This is a wonderful product! Baby is snuggly and warm at night.  We've used many of these sleepsacks in the past and have always been happy with the quality of HALO products.
+1	This is a nice, cozy fleece sleep sack for the winter months.  My son sleeps well in these esp. since we can't use blankets in the cribs these days.  I love the puppy dog print on this one:).  Very cute!
+1	At 12 months old, my daughter is old enough for a blanket in her crib, but she rolls all over creation when she sleeps. There is no way a blanket would stay put long enough to do any good. We use the sleepsacks. Although she likes to crawl and stand (she's not yet walking), the sleepsack doesn't seem to get in her way. No issues with its bunching under her knees or feet and tripping her. The cotton sleepsack works well during spring and fall when the nights are cold but not freezing, but the fleece is perfect for the winter. She doesn't seem bothered that her arms are uncovered.
+1	These sleeps sacks are great. Bed room is over garage and gets chilly at night so these are nice and warm for the baby. Better than swaddling
+1	These sleep sacks work great for our baby.  The fleece helped keep him warm through the winter.  We haven't had any problems with HALO brand and would recommend it to anyone.
+1	These are perfect for east coast winters. We love them! My only complaint is that sometimes my son (now 7 months) can pull apart the zipper.
+1	I love that you can unzip these from the bottom and perform a diaper change at night without having to completely undress the baby.  The fleece blankets are great to layer over footie pjs in the winter to keep baby toasty warm.Good quality material and zipper.
+1	I love the Halo sleepsacks. This is not a swaddle sack, so don't get confused! The swaddle sacks were pretty worthless for my Houdini baby, but once we broke him of the swaddle I started using these Halo wearable blanket sacks. They are the perfect weight for cooler nights, and they hold up through many washes and wears.
+1	Perfect weight, has held up to daily use and washed at least once a week for the past 5 months +.
+1	This are great. They will keep your baby warm, comfortable and safe, and one size will last you many many months (unlike other baby clothes). I put my baby in a blanket sleeper and then put the halo sleep sack over that.
+1	I have this in the 100% cotton version and the microfleece.  It keeps my baby toasty but not too hot.  It's a light fleece.  I especially appreciate knowing (from the information on the company website) that this has not been treated with flame retardant chemicals (since it's a blanket, and not a pj).
-1	I purchased this wearable blanket to avoid sids. Even though where I live isn't extremely cold it's cold enough that one wearable blanket was not warm enough. Also because of his size, it kept riding up on him which was really annoying.
+1	I've bought other brands of sleep sacks, and regret doing so after I came across this one, which I think is the original sleep sack. I can see why it's the best selling one; it's cozy, thick, incredibly well-made, and doesn't pill/ball when stuck in the washing machine, which- let's face it- with a baby you are going to need to do quite often! My daughter's earlier sleep sacks have pilled like crazy, torn, and had zippers that were of such poor quality that they poked at her- which obviously defeats the purpose of having this blanket which should be helping put baby to sleep!
+1	Nice and warm. Wear it on top of fleece pj and my lo likes the feel of it. She has lots of room in it since I got XL.
+1	My 6 month old kept kicking off his blankets, so the sleep sack has helped a lot. The sizing is a little funny, see other reviews for more details to help you get the right size. It's winter now, which makes the fleece great, but in summer it would definitely be too hot.
+1	Love love love our Halo Sleep Sacks!  My baby HATED being swaddled but I didn't want loose blankets in her crib, so gave these a try.  They're perfect!  Tons of room in the bottom for her to kick her legs around, and her arms are free, but it keeps her toasty warm on those cold winter nights!
+1	We liked this sleep sac very much. We bought it a second time once our daughter grew out of the large.
+1	When we stopped swaddling, we transitioned our boys to sleep sacks. We use Halo cotton sleep sacks in warmer weather; fleece when it's cold. They are well-made, cozy, comfortable, and the boys seem to like them. No complaints here!
+1	My son rolls around A LOT in his crib during naptime and at bedtime, and it's impossible to keep a blanket on him! We received one of these as a gift for him in size small, and I've loved it so much, I keep buying the larger size when he outgrows the prior one. I definitely recommend this for babies who are physically active in their sleep. :)
+1	Do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size.  My son is at the top end of the size large weight range, but this item will still fit him for many months.  Instead, look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination.  My tall son is growing out of size 18-24 month clothing, but the size large sleepsack (size 12-18 months) will fit him for many more months.
+1	I don't know what I would do w/o this, my baby can kick out of her button-down-the-leg-pjs let alone blankets, but this solves that! This offers peace of mind in knowing that your baby is sleeping warmly and safely inside this cozy wearable blanket.  I only got size medium because my baby was born in the summer (and born small) so her room wasn't as cold, AND newborns stay swaddled anyway--thus I think medium is a very versatile size and makes size small almost obsolete.  I will buy a larger size when she finally outgrows the Med, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.  You and your baby simply can't live or sleep w/o this product!
+1	I got sleeping sacks from Carter's and from another brand but they weren't half as good as this one. Plenty of room for your LO to move her legs. Comfy and warm. I love it.What I love the most though, is the inverted zipper. Instead of going from the bottom up, it goes from chin to bottom. This prevents you from accidentally catching the baby's chin with the zipper.
+1	I can't say enough about these wearable blankets. My little guy is 19 months, and he rolls around all night. Regular blankets don't stay on so these are perfect. He wears these fleece ones in winter with a fleece onesie underneath.
+1	The AAP recommends not using loose blankets at nighttime.  There aren't a ton of options for wearable blankets.  I have three of these - one in Small, one in Medium, and one in Large.  Ever since we stopped swaddling our daughter, she has slept in one of these every single night.  It's also recommended to keep the baby's bedroom cool, so we keep the air temperature such that she sleeps in one of these sleep sacks and a footie pajamas.  I think my daughter now associates the sleep sack with sleep.The sleep sacks are very soft and cuddly.  They're not super thick, but are a bit heavier than a couple of other brands I've seen.
+1	I love this sleep sack for cold winter nights.  I had another brand of fleece sleep sack but I was not comfortable using it because my baby pulls his pajamas or sleep sack into this mouth and chews on it if he is awake in his crib.  He pulls whatever cloth is closest to his mouth.  The other sleep sack had a zipper that zipped up toward the neck.  It had a little flap to cover it but I was still afraid that my baby would chew it and the zipper pull would come off into his mouth and he would choke on it.  HALO sleep sacks zip from the top down so the zipper pull is nowhere near your baby's mouth.  With my first son I always wondered why they did this.  Now with my second baby I clearly see the benefit.  I can seriously rest easily at night knowing that there is not a choking hazard in my baby's crib.  This fleece sleep sack is also nice and warm in the winter without overheating my baby.
+1	We decided to purchase this sleepsack since we did not want our little one to have a bunch of covers with him in the crib at night and he would always kick them off anyway. This sack is very warm and now we dont have to set our thermostat to 71 degrees Fahrenheit anymore just to make sure he is warm at nights.
+1	Ever since utero, our son loved being curled up in a ball. When he was an infant we had him in the HALO SleepSack that tucked his arms in also (wrapped him like a burrito). As he got older, he liked moving his arms around so we purchased this. It was always perfect for him and he slept better with it on (we removed it and he slept terribly those nights). We started moving away from the sleep sacks at about 10 months old and he now just wears pajamas.
+1	We love halo sleepsacks! I never have to worry about a blanket coming undone and covering up my daughter's face. My only gripe is that after a few washes, the fleece becomes kind of matted. We use the fleece for cold nights but also love the cotton ones for warmer nights.  We love how it unzips from the bottom for easy diaper changes.
+1	I purchased two for my twin sons.  This was easy to put on my sons and I love how the zipper unzips from the bottom for easy diaper changes.
+1	With SIDS to worry about, I really do sleep more soundly at night knowing that my baby is warm but not at risk of being smothered by a loose blanket. The bottom-to-top zipper really is convenient for diaper changes, and while the sleepsack did shrink somewhat in the wash, that really hasn't affected its fit on our baby. We went from a fleece sleepsack (infant size) to a cotton one (medium) when the weather started getting warm. Our baby is big (14 lbs and 25 inches at 12 weeks), so we got a medium (one size larger than recommended) hoping it would fit all summer. We shouldn't have worried. The sizes are very generous, but even a very big sleepsack works - there's enough room to grow into without being loose enough at the arm- or neckholes to cause tangling or a smothering hazard. It's perfect for summer nights that are just cool enough that we want to be sure that the baby's feet and legs stay covered, even if her nightgown rides up.  Overall, I wouldn't trade the sleepsack for a regular blanket, and I highly recommend it to all parents of infants.
+1	My daughter loves her sleep sacks.  She was swaddled for almost six months and then we transitioned to the sleep sack.  It took a few nights, but she finally got it - and now she loves it.  In addition, we live in a colder climate and do not heat the house above 62 degrees at night, so combined with a little heater, this sleep sack does the trick.I have tried Aiden and Anais as well as Grobag.  I find neither to compare to the functionality, the longevity and the simplicity of the HALO.  We have this sleep sack in fleece as well as cotton, depending on the temperature.  We have not even gotten the early walker yet and this works just fine.  Ultimately, when we put her in the sleep sack, it's time for bed and there will be no more walking anyway, so this works just fine for us!Highly recommend.
+1	We have been using these since our baby was no longer interested in being swaddled. We started using the Medium size before she was quite big enough for it (at 3 months), and even though it was longer than we needed, it still fit well around her arms and neck. It wasn't too loose to be comfortable and safe. Now that she is on the verge of outgrowing the Medium, I've gone straight to an XL because again, even though it's longer than we need, the larger size doesn't pose any safety risks and is quite comfortable. She is a very wiggle baby and is able to get around her crib and even stand up in these without hurting herself or getting twisted up. We get both the fleece and cotton one so we can interchange them based on the weather. During the winter months, we used a blanket with the fleece sack and the fleece actually gripped the blanket so she stayed covered even when she moved around. In terms of durability, we wash them in the machine on hot and they've held up well for 6+ months. The ones she has outgrown are still in good enough shape to use for another child, hand down, etc. I really love this product.
+1	So happy I use these for my baby, secure, easy, practical, simple, I love these, I'll be getting more soon : )you can't go wrong with these. get them.
+1	This sleepsack was a gift for a little guy.  The product was extremely well-made, and the color was an exact match to the advertisement.  Very nice item.
+1	We were wanting to get out guy out of the swaddling because he kept waking when he broke free at night.  The HALO SleepSack was our answer.  Our boy is a big 7 mo and there is plenty of room in there for him for the foreseeable future.  The fleece is a little warmer than HALO's cotton version.  They are, however, almost interchangeable,  we have one each and use both (whichever is clean)
+1	We love the SleepSacks and have been using them since 3 months old when we abandoned the swaddles since he was showing signs of rolling over.  We use the micro-fleece in the winter and the cotton ones in the summer.We dress him in a long sleeve body suit and then put this over it.  He loves it!
+1	These are the best! Super warm and wash well. The size xl is just now getting too small. My son can walk fine in these and the sleep sack is part of his bedtime routine.Love it!! We own about 4 of them- in case one gets dirty or such.
+1	had some reservations about spending this much on a fleece sleep sack. we now have three, in heavy rotation and are very happy with the quality. after many washings they remain soft and cozy with a well working zipper. would buy again and recommend.
+1	Our toddler has been sleeping in Halos since he was a tiny baby, they're so practical and easy to put on.
+1	I love it and so my baby. It is very comfortable and soft. My daughter cannot sleep without a sleep sack. And I do not worry that she will kick off a blanket and get cold at a middle of night. With a sleep sack everybody sleeps better :)
+1	I use this for the baby all the time for sleeping in. It is nice and soft, zips up the front and is a cute pattern. Good price on Amazon too. I would recommend it and would definitely buy another one.
+1	This sleep sack came and I was shocked at how large it was get a size down for sure!! Our son wont be able to use this for months but it is soft and cute!
+1	It's a bit big, but with the way babies/toddlers grow, I don't mind.  My son walks around in it and it doesn't slow him down one bit!  He sleeps so much better at night with the extra layer the wearable blanket provides.
+1	As we all know, you're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent SIDS. The SleepSack is a great product! It keeps baby nice and warm, yet you don't have to worry about a blanket. And there's space down in the bottom for his feet so he's not too restricted. Also, the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom, so you don't have a big zipper poking baby in the face.
+1	This is great for the chillier winter months.  I never use this along with fleece jammies, but with thin cotton jammies this is perfect.  Great way to keep baby warm and not worry about a blanket.
+1	It is very soft, and I like the color.It is large for my 7 month baby. Also recommended .the price is also good for the quality.
+1	The Boppy pillow is the one must-nave item for you and your baby. Use it around your waist to help support your newborn while he nurses ... mine is asleep on ours after nursing as I write! At a few months of age, use it under his tummy to work on tummy time. Eventually, he can use it as a support when he learns to sit up! With so many covers to choose from and so easy to care for, it's something every new mom should have.
+1	I have two in different parts of the house.  After my C-section these really helped me to feed my son.
+1	My daughter and I have thoroughly enjoyed the Boppy.  I haven't used it quite as much as I thought I would but I am definitely glad that we have one.
-1	The bobby was way too cumbersome for nursing.  It was given to me as a gift, a lot of people said great things about it and I registered for it before my baby was due.  In the beginning, I would spend a lot of time trying to get the boppy comfortable around me and in place before someone handed me my daughter during feeding times.  Now I just grab my daughter, go to a chair/couch and find a comfortable pillow and do just fine without a boppy!  The boppy is collecting dust.  Pillows work just fine!UPDATE: after 2 years and 2 babies, the Boppy is now my favorite for when the baby is around 5 months old-7 months: for putting behind them for sitting up!  I still can't stand the boppy for nursing, but I really love it for a cushion when they are sitting up!
+1	I love my Boppy pillow.  The luxe cover is the way to go--super soft and stays that way after washing, too.  I use it nursing and to position my 7 week old in when we're just lying around.  Though I use this often and really have no complaints, I gave it four stars because of one issue.  Because of its size, it is very difficult to use with a glider.  At night I don't use it for nursing because it does not fit between the arms of my glider and, when positioned on top of the arms, my son is too high to nurse.  I'm a petite person at 115 lbs, so I can imagine that other mothers might also experience this difficulty.
+1	I find that the boppy pillow is very handy. It is soft and comfortable, our baby loves his. I gave 4 stars bc I found that it was difficult to breastfeed with (awkward). Our dog even loves to lay in the boppy. I recommend this product highly.
+1	This was our life saver for our sons first 9 months!!! We used this for ever bottle feeding. Our son was super comfortable and relaxed during feedings. Was especially great those first couple months during the night feedings. I could sit up in bed and feed on this him well I was still relaxed!!! The fleece cover is the best too. Super soft!!! The other covers feel kind of scratchy and are definetly not as soft as this one!!!!
+1	I love the boppy, when my back hurts it's the perfect way to nurse, baby loves to play on boppy!
+1	Definately a good thing.  I actually ended up receiving the 5-in-1 boppy pillow gym and that is many great things in one.  I  used it in the beginning for feedings and it's an arm saver for sure.  Now the little one uses it for entertainment and tummy time.  It's a nice change for her to be elevated once and a while instead of laying flat on the floor. Soon she will be able to use it to help her sit up.
+1	I love my Bobby pillow.  I have little arms so it was much easier to rest my daughter on the pillow than try to hold her the whole time while nursing.  When I'm giving her a bottle I like to prop it under my arm so it doesn't get sore.  The cover is soft and fuzzy and it washes up beautifully.  I consider this a must have!
+1	the boppy is so useful that i bring it to my mother's house when we visit because a regular pillow just wont do. puts my daughter at just the right height for nursing and/or bottle feeding.  Also, my arms, or my baby's head, did not rest on the arms of the rocker and made sitting in the rocker for longer periods a lot more tolerable.  when my daughter was a newborn i felt like she and I were both well-supported and very comfortable.  also, as a newborn it brought her within eye range while we were sitting, without much effort on my part.
-1	I'm not sure what the fuss is surrounding this product and why so many deem it a "must-have"  I find that a regular firm pillow works just as well if not better.  The width of the boppy is too narrow to support a bigger baby.  The U-shape isn't especially comfortable to me.  The other problem I've had is washing.  They come with slip covers now, but if you ever need to wash the pillow itself, it screws up the distribution of the stuffing.I much prefer the My Breast Friend pillow: it has a back support and is adjustable.  Very comfortable and gives the baby a wider and flater surface to lay on.  Mine is the inflatable version, which is great - when you take off the cover to wash, you can easily clean the pillow beneith with just a damp cloth.  My baby also like sitting in it better than the boppy.
+1	I LOVE THIS!  I AM A FIRST TIME MOM WHO BREAST FEEDS MY BABY AND I FOUND THIS TO BE SUCH A LIFE SAVER!  MY SON IS 9 MONTHS NOW AND WE STILL USE IT ALMOST EVERY FEEDING.  IT SAVES YOUR ARM AND NECK FROM FEELING STRAINED AND HOLDS THE BABY AT JUST THE RIGHT LEVEL FOR NURSING.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY MOTHER.
+1	Whether you are breast or bottle feeding a boppy is a must have!  It is much easier to hold your little one for long periods with this item.  I really comes in handy for those middle-of-the-night feedings when you are totally exausted!  There were times when my son would only sleep if I held him.  The boppy has saved my life!
+1	This boppy is a must have for breastfeeding and tummy time! Highly recommend it!
+1	I bought this because my sister had something like it when she was breastfeeding, and she said it really helped with positioning her baby. When we first started breastfeeding, about an hour after I gave birth, it was really hard to hold my baby to my breast. It was too difficult to support his head with my arm, and regular pillows didn't work. The only way I could comfortably feed him is with the boppy. This one may be a little more expensive, but it has a cute fleece cover that easily washes and stays very soft. You can use the boppy for feeding, positioning baby on his belly or back, or even for you to sit on after giving birth (like a doughnut) to help with perineal pain. The possibilities are endless!
+1	I had heard of this pillow from some new mommies.  I also knew that a lot of them had planned to breastfeed and that was usually what it was used for.  As a physical therapist and since my husband has some back pain occassionally, I knew that this would be a big help for bottle feeding as well.  You can use it to support your arm that is holding the baby so you feel no strain in your arm, shoulder or back.  So, that is initally what we used it for.Once we had it lying around though, we have found so many other uses.  We used it initally for some of that recommended "tummy time" when he couldn't tolerate lifting his head or chest at all.  He used to just look down at the floor from it and seemed to be amused.  Also, he started to try to climb over it since he really wants to move.I know that the instructions specifically state not to use it while sleeping.  But, I think that is because it is a pillow, no doubt, but my son loves to feel cuddled and this pillow is great for that.  So, he has taken naps in it and also we took this a long on our first road trip and he slept swaddled and in this pillow in the middle of the king size bed.  It gave us peace of mind that neither of us would roll onto him, so it was a great barrier.  And my son seemed to always like his head elevated when he slept, so this was a fantastic thing to own.We also let him rest in the Boppy when we have Sesame Street on TV or a music CD on.  And he even liked to be propped up in it when we sing songs and move his arms and legs.  That way I have two hands available and direct eye contact.  Also, when he can't move, it was a great resting spot like when I had to run to the bathroom.Like I said, we loved it so much at first that after we had this Luxe Boppy which we use upstairs in his room, we bought a naked pillow with a Luxe cover for downstairs.  I would recommend either, but as far as soft and plush, this Luxe Boppy is slightly nicer.  And even if you aren't planning on breastfeeding, I have found a ton of uses for this pillow and my husband and I agree that it has been money well spent.
+1	If you are expecting a baby, you need a Boppy!  As a nursing mother, I don't know what I would have done without this pillow, particularly in the early days when I was trying to figure it all out.  It gets the baby in the right position so he/she doesn't have to search for the breast and the mother has a hand free to guide the baby.As she got older, I no longer needed the pillow for nursing.  Instead, the Boppy was being used to prop her up after feedings and for naptime.  Then, I started using it for tummy time and then to give her support as she learned to sit.I recommend this to every mother out there!This particular slipcover is very soft and comfy, although it does become less so after numerous washes.  I still recommend getting one, though.
+1	I purchased my first boppy when my middle child was born. Hes now 2 and I purchased this one for my now 5 month old.Well first things are first, it IS a breastfeeding pillow, but its also MUCH more!*  First of all, breast feeding with the boppy isnt IDEAL, but it works. I am able to sit comfortably, with my son quite comfortable. I have heard that the "brest friend" is better for this, but since the boppy has more uses, I prefer it.*  Same with bottle feeding, you can have the baby feel like hes nursing, so dads, you wont be left out!*  When its tummy time, you can use the boppy to prop up your baby. Niether of my boys would stay on their tummies without the boppy with them.*  I used this (and still do) to prop up the boys for sitting up. My baby can sit up unnasisted, but he still prefers to do so with the boppy.*  I also loved that my toddler (and 4 1/2 year old!) likes to use the pillow to watch T.V on, and its GREAT for doing arts and crafts on (on the floor).*  I tend to use it on long car rides, its great neck support and really makes me feel comfortable. I also steal them when I sleep!*  The kids find many things to do with the boppys, including pillow fighting with them, using them as a "desk" while sitting on the couch, wearing it as a "headband", using it as a headrest while watching T.V on thier backs, and making a boppy circle (you will need two, facing eachother forming a circle) and sitting in it!*  I also like that the boppy can be used outside with the vinyl cover. It protects your boppy, and also makes it GREAT when the kids are doing arts and crafts on the floor, they are leaning on your favorite pillow, and its okay!*  As far as washing your boppy, you can throw the WHOLE THING into the washing machine. When you throw it in the drier, throw in a tennis ball too, all of the smells, stains, and other things will soon dissapear after boppy is washed. It also doesnt fade all that much.As of now, the boppy has proven to be a source of endless fun, and is very useful! I fully anticipate keeping the boppy way after my baby becomes older... thats how great it is!
+1	One of the best things created for moms in the last few years. Definitely a must have. It makes breastfeeding so much easier, plus it has other functions like propping baby up and to introduce tummy time. I absolutely love it, and there are so many different designs or covers. Great registry item!
+1	My son is 4 months old and he loves this blanket. He like to hold on to things while hes using his pacifier and it makes him feel comfortable. I love how it has the pacifier holder and teething corners. I would suggest this to anyone. Thanks
-1	1. It was not the same as the photo, but I was too lazy to contact Amazon about it.2. Baby only likes it slightly.
+1	I'd give this five stars, except that my son is not really into the teething corners (but perhaps not YET--he is 4.5 months old).  What I love about it is that its machine washable (I put it in the dryer, too, though I don't know if the manufacturer recommends this).  He's has this for a month, and it's easy for him to get into his mouth, even without a great deal of control!  Highly recommend--we have two, because one is always in the wash.
+1	Fun to hold, squeeze, and chew on!  My baby loves this item.  The corners are teethers, and the blanket is nice and soft.  Great baby item.
+1	We were always losing paci's and I was looking for some way to keep from doing that without attaching it to my baby. This was perfect and it is soft and I love that it has teething corners. Bought two of them because we loved it so much.
+1	Toy is exactly as described; baby just doesn't like it very much. Prefers the Orajel Munchkin teether and the Lifefactory teether.
+1	My son loves his Step and Play, even without turning on the music.  He really likes being upright, and this stationary entertainer gave us a needed break from holding him!The only disappointment was that we quickly lost the tray - it doesn't stay attached well.This is a fairly bulky stationary entertainer - if we put it in the back of our Jeep Cherokee, we can't carry much else.  If you are looking for portability, this is not the way to go, because I can't figure out a way to disassemble it.  It is very durable, though, and is showing no signs of wear and tear so far!
+1	This is just what I need for those times when my daughter wants to walk all over the place and grab everything in sight. In the Step & Play Piano, no matter where she turns, there's something safe for her to play with. The thing that I like about this is it's not a mobile walker, so she can't wander away or bump into anything, but unlike other stationary entertainers, she still has the ability to use her feet to move herself forward (which she loves to do). If you use it on a smooth surface or a floor that's not carpeted be advised that it can move slightly when baby does allot of bouncing. It's not enough to slide across the floor into anything, but just be aware that there is nothing to keep it attached to one spot on the floor. Also, make sure you assemble in the room where you want to keep it or in a room you can easily move it out of because it doesn't fold down or disassemble. I've read some reviews that said babies were scratched by the underside of the seat. I haven't had this problem. Apparently Fisher-Price redesigned it and now it comes with a smooth seat frame with no sharp edges.***Update***When my little girl started to stand I went looking for a toy that she could use for balance. It wasn't long before I realized that we already had the perfact thing, the Step & Play Piano! First she just held on to the top, then gradually she started taking a few steps. Now I have removed the seat and she cruises all around, stepping on keys, playing the instruments and looking at herself in the mirror. This is one of the best baby investments I've made. Finally, an item she won't grow out of before she's a year old!
+1	My daughter received this as a gift when she was 6 months old and loves it.  Even when she is not in it she will roll over or creep to it and hit the big keys on the base and gets really upset if it is off and not making music.  I especially like that there are different configurations so that she will be able to enjoy this toy for a long time.  Once again Fisher Price has another wonderful product!
+1	We purchased this toy for our daughter when she was six months old and 7 months later it still continues to be a favorite of hers.I initially liked the idea of the walker that is on the track because many babies are hurt in the walkers that the baby can freely roam around in.  I never imagined she would love it as much as she did (and does)though!When we first put her in it, it served as more of an exersaucer.  She would sit quietly in it, look in the mirror, beat on the piano keys, and grab the little rattle.  Then, one day, she realized she could actually move around a little bit and so back and forth she went on the track, stomping on the keys with delight.  It warmed my heart to see my little girl enjoying something so much.  Now that she is thirteen months old, the seat has been removed and she loves to stomp on the piano keys and compose her own music.I think this one of the most versatile toys and it has lasted so long in our house that it is well worth the money.  I'd recommend it any day.
+1	I purchased this for my daughter when she was 7 months old primarily to use as a stationery walker.  She absolutely loved the lights and music and I liked the fact that she not only could spin in a circle but actually WALK back and forth.  When she began walking I removed the seat and she loved to run and stomp on the piano keys to activate the music.  She uses it more than any toy she has.  It is by far the BEST stationery walker on the market because it lasts from infancy well into toddlerhood.
-1	Let me start by saying that I don't leak a ton and I got a free box of these. That being said, even for free I don't want to use these. They sound (yes sound) horrible as they're crinkly. If I leaked more I'd be really concerned because I just don't see how these would hold up. When I push them aside to nurse they ball up and I can't really reuse them. I like the avent so much better (softer, not crinkly, absorbent and actually hold up). I wouldn't spend the $ on these ever even if they were the only option.
+1	These are nice and thin and don't show through thin shirts (I wear them with the nursing bras that are similar to sports bras).  Their shape conforms nicely to the breast so you don't have weird creases showing through either. They have never leaked and they slip in an out easily.  Exactly what I needed and wanted. Thanks for another great product Medela!
-1	PROSI've never leaked.It's really thin.CONSIt feels like plastic.It does not allow my skin to breathe and make my breasts really itchy.It won't stick to your bra. The small sticky tab doesn't do much.It stinks at the end of the day.Yellow powder gets on your fingers if you open the wrapper wrong.Lansinoh has two sticky tabs that work.  And it doesn't make my breasts itchy or sweaty.  And their wrappers do not have any weird coloring on it.
+1	In terms of absorption these are the best pads I have tried (out of 3 different brands), but they could use some contouring and if you wear them in a thin bra plan on layering up your shirts unless your advertising that your breasts leak.
-1	Have tried 3 different brands now and I liek these the least. My breast leakinsane amounts throughout the day so no matter what pad I wear I have to change it every hour or so. I have to wear 2-3 pads on each breast regardless! Totally crazy I know!These pads though when not soaked yet are like putting paper between my bra and breast so they're not comfortable at all and they crumple up a bit in places. The tape is pointless as they don't move around at all as did none of the others brands I tried. If you have a bra that fits a bra pad will stay in place. One other issue is and at the same time it's a positive I guess is that because these pads are kind of like a diaper in the sense of being absorbent and having that extra layer, you don't always know until you happen to touch one of the pads that it's completely soaked through for who knows how long! It's very obvious when one is soaked as it weight a whole lot more and feels like a dead jellyfish, but you only know this when you check it. I would not buy these again.
-1	These pads are definitely due for some revamping. When women can buy nearly customized bras based on chest width and cup size, it's ridiculous to have a "one pad fits all" type of product. I have read other reviews and women complain about washable/reusable pads, but after trying everything out there, I would argue that washable pads:*fit better*look better from the outside (these look like you're stuffing with Kleenex)*are a lot easier to put back in one-handed while holding a baby - no messing around with annoying adhesives and strange folds in the materialDisposable do tend to be better for women who leak a lot, but before settling on these pads, try both. I bought every kind out there, both reusable and disposable, and found some I swear by from Mimi Maternity. They fit well, aren't noticable, and won't leak.
+1	I like these pads because they are very absorant and do not show through my clothes. They also leave my skin very dry which is very important for keeping healthy nipples.  However, during breastfeeding I have to be careful in folding them in my bra in order to reuse them once I am done, if I don't I have to use new ones because they become all wrinkled and useless.  For that reason I use these only during the day.  At night I use Lansinoh pads, they are bigger and more absorbant than these and I can still reuse them even when I mistreat them during feeding.
-1	I had heard so much about Medela, they were great for nursing supplies. When I ordered these breast pads, I thought they would be a great deal. Unfortunately these pads are not good for mothers who produce a lot of milk. I ended up changing my nursing pads three times a day, and had to get up in the middle of the night to change them again. I had high hopes that fell dreadfully low. I would not suggest this for friends.
+1	Two words: Get them!Plain and simple.  These pads can hold up to three ounces of breastmilk and provide great coverage.  I don't have to worry about them shifting or leaking on me at night and I leak a LOT.I have tried most of the nursing pads on the market and these are second only to the Lansinoh brand.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone who battles those embarassing leaks.
-1	I received two sample pairs of these breast pads when I bought my Medela Pump in Style, and I'm glad I got the pads for free instead of spending $10 on a whole box.  Yes, the pads are thin and so they don't show through clothing.  However, I haven't had a problem with any of the pads I've worn showing.  These pads make a big deal about being "form fitted" due to the two little pleats, which give them a natural 3-dimensional curve.  However, again, I've never had a problem with unpleated pads and how they fit (and I have a VERY large bust).  But, the thing that I really hate about the Medela pads is the adhesive.  It's such a small piece of adhesive that it really should have been left off entirely.  It's just big enough to make it hard to remove the pads from the bra for nursing, but it's too small to really hold the pad in place while the bra is open.  This makes the pad ruffle up badly, and it's very difficult to get it back into shape when you put your bra back in place.  After only one or two times of putting the bra down and back up, I found that the pads were bunched up into uncomfortable, lumpy balls inside my bra, and there was really no way of fixing them.  Personally, I prefer the First Years nursing pads with lanolin.  They are very absorbent, they hold their shape through multiple nursing sessions, and they don't show through clothing.
+1	The medela nursing pads worked just fine for me, especially for overnight use.  I also used them as a backup during the day with the lilz pads.
+1	The music is very nice (parent friendly)The mobile is very entertaining to babies.ALL remote control mobiles have a big weakness - the remotes only work when they're in the same room as the mobile.  This means you have to get up every time you want to restart it. No one has created an RF remote.  At least this model runds a long time before shutting off.What you read about the poor design of the pole is really true.  It doesn't lock in place, and the segemented pole doesn't even lock together.  Truly a terrible design.I'm giving it 4 stars because ALL mobiles will in fact break apart and crash on a baby that pulls on the toys.  Parents need to be careful with all mobiles - not just this one.  The fact is that this mobile has more useful features and more engaging toys than all the others I have seen.Everybody complains about the poor arm design, yet they buy the product fully knowing what could happen.  The FIRST day I caught my daughter grabbing the toys, I took it down.  If your child can stand in her crib, remove ALL mobiles - period.
+1	This product looks and works as advertised.  The mobile worked very well and was very attractive to watch- it definitely kept my baby's attention at times when we wanted him to stay in his crib.  The music was mediocre in quality, and didn't seem to sooth my baby.  He liked to hit all the buttons on it, so regardless of the music duration, it was always off long before that.  The thing I hated the most was the remote.  Unless your nursery is the size of a barn, I'm not sure why you would want a remote.  It's just another piece of junk that takes AA batteries and clutters up a tabletop.  That kind of poor engineering is just a waste of money.I've had this product for 3 years now.  Our second child has actually used it far more heavily than our first did.  He turns it on each morning and listens to it on his own for a while before fully waking up.  Sometimes hell do the same when he goes to bed.  Everything has held up well over the years.  I still hate the remote, though. i would have preferred to save $5 instead.
+1	We bought this mobile after a defective Fisher Price one didn't work at all. Although the animals on the FP mobile were cuter than this one, the music on the Tiny Love is very high-quality, long-lasting and impressive. The volume choices are just right for us - neither too loud, nor too quiet. The colors are great and the googly eyes on the animals catch our 2-month-old's attention. Works great on our cradle so far - the "hook" that holds it in place is another added advantage over the FP mobile we had. It's worth the price for the remote control extra - just think you can sit across the room or at the door and just press the button to restart the mobile. Worth it!
+1	My son will watch this mobile for about 30 minutes, sometimes he plays and sometimes he watches it and falls asleep.  I don't know what it is about this toy, but he loves it.  I'm really glad we got this mobile, it's a little pricey, but worth the money and it's runs for a long time.  It seems like 15 or 20 minutes.
+1	I purchased a Tiny Love Gymini, FP Ocean Wonders Aquarium, and some other misc. toys to entertain our little one (now 2m).  I thought they were cute.  He couldn't care less about them....at least not right now.  He loved this mobile from the moment it was pulled out of the box.  He will stare at it, talk to the animals, coo, and giggle.  It keeps him entertained for a whole 15 min. and sometimes longer which gives me time to put in a load of laundry, grab a quick bite to eat, and etc.  He'll even stare at it when he's not in the crib, which keeps him entertained during diaper changes.  It's expensive, but oh so worth it.  Two thumbs way up!
+1	Overall I love this mobile.  The music is great quality, although i wish it had an even lower volume setting.  the remote works great and what i love the most is that the box can be set to activate the music manually, or that the music can only be activated by the remote.  my daughter loves the animals and it is really very stimulating in color design and motion.  the reason i took one star away is that on each arm there are 3 shapes that slide around, making too much sound for my daughter.  it startled her every time when she was about to fall asleep, so i took a rubberband and fixed it around the shapes so they wouldn't slide anymore.  since then, it works like a charm.  i have not had any technical problems with it so far, 3 weeks of use, so i keep my fingers crossed.over all it's a very nice mobile, and having two kids, i've been through quite a few, still haven't found the perfect one, but this is the closest i've found to perfect.
+1	My 3 month old daughter absolutely loves this mobile.  At first I thought it was a bit crazy looking and it didn't quite go well with our theme but overall, I'm so happy we registered for this.  The music, colors and movement keeps her attention.  I have to warn, if you're looking for a mobile that will put your baby to sleep, this isn't the one for you.  It's too stimulating for rest.  We also have the Ocean Wonders Aquarium in her crib and use that in the evening to soothe her to sleep.
-1	I purchased this mobile for my little one thinking it would be a slam dunk.  Pretty colors, remote control, several classical tunes... well, it would be perfect if it worked.  It broke the same evening I put it together.  Though the music played, the mobile didn't go around as it was supposed to.  I contacted Tiny Love and they sent me replacement parts, but it still didn't work.  I ended up returning it to BRU.  Reading the other reviews I guess I was not the only one with the same problem.  I do give it one star because it is pretty... but that's about it!  :-)
+1	I bought this when my daughter graduated to the big crib at three months. She laughs continously when I turn this on. It isn't very useful to lull her to sleep but I use it to entertain her in the morning when I getting ready. My only complaint is the way it attaches to the crib, it's a bit awkward and it damaged the wood finish a little, however a little padding under it has solved the problem. I have never used the remote, so I can't comment on it.
-1	I got this as a baby shower gift and thought it seemed like a good idea since I didn't intend to buy jarred food.It is hard to put together, very hard to take apart, and a total pain to clean.  Also, it doesn't grind the food very well AT ALL.  The very few times I tried to use it I got so mad that I swore I'd never use it again.It turned out that I didn't really need to puree food for my baby anyways.  Simply mashing in a bowl with a fork or cutting into very small pieces was completely sufficient.
-1	I am VERY disappointed with this product. It worked the first two times I tried it, with an apple and a pear. I tried it again this morning with an apple and couldn't get it to grate the apple at all. I think the blade has dulled... Anyway, I am thoroughly unimpressed and will be returning it.
+1	It was probably a great idea overall, but I did not find any use for it.When you go out to eat - you have enough stuff to carry with you so the jares were just fine. At home I'd just use the food processor - easier and faster.The product is good, if you need it.
+1	The good: It works well and does exactly what I bought it for: pureeing food from the table at home and while traveling so I don't have to deal with jarred food. I've used it successfully on peas, all kinds of fruit, pasta, rice, cooked carrots and brussels sprouts. I'd recommend it.The bad: I need to stick a fork in one of the holes in order to take the top off. I need a dishwasher or veggie brush to clean the holes. The crank started wobbling after a few uses. It doesn't puree meat.
-1	If I could give this product less than 1 star, I would.  My Mom told me that all's I needed was a grinder to feed my baby, so I bought this one.  It never ground up a single piece of food.  My Mom was convinced that maybe I was doing it wrong and she had the same experience. Her reaction was "they just don't make things they way they use to."  It was a waist of money and after many attempts, it ended up in the trash.  We ended up using a fork to mash soft foods and a small food processor for bigger stuff.  My next baby, I hope to invest in the Beaba Baby Cooker.
-1	i received this as a gift from my mother.  Those of you pureeing meat in your food mill --- do we have the same product????? Mine has a plastic grate.  I **barely** mashed up some cooked peas in this thing.  I can't imagine getting meat through this!  That "blade" is like a dull butter knife.  It worked great with a ripe avocado, and that was about the end of that.  You really need three hands to get this working - two to push down and stabilize at the same time (I have to press really really hard), and a third to turn the handle.  I have yet to be able to successfully turn the handle and press at the same time in any effective fashion.  You also have to get messy to get the grate disk off, the only way to do it is to press down on the dirty grate with your thumbs and work it off.  When it's covered in a slick puree that's not easy.  Also, the plastic stains easily.  I put a watermelon chunk in there, and now it's permanently stained orange.  It's a great concept, but I would NOT buy this.
+1	I use it for my baby when traveling =)  very portable and no need of battery is a plus of course =p
+1	Great product for those of us who want to feed our babies healthy, wholesome foods.  Great for home or travel.  No more lugging around premade, store bought baby food in breakable, glass jars!  You can feed your baby practically what ever you're having and grind it up fine enough for their precious little mouths to chew and swallow without the fear of them choking on something cut too big.  I highly recommend this product to anyone.  Would even work for those who are older and need their food pureed.  Can't say enough good things about this very valuable, easy to use, easy to clean, handy product.
-1	I ordered this because it contains the colors babies are first able to see.  I was disappointed with the quality.  The pictures look like a five year old drew them and are somewhat scary.  Great concept, poor quality.
+1	This would be able to be used beyond the first three months because it is soft and baby ant get hurt on it like they could on the stiff cardboard types which last only first three months,
+1	bought this for our 4 weeks when she started tracking and looking at contrasting things...the mirrored section is a big hit, she will stare at this for quite a while and seems to enjoy it
+1	We placed this on our changing table.  Our daughter loves looking at the zebra and other shapes while we are changing her.  She coos at it and it's a great attention getter when we need her to stop squirming so we can change her diaper. We even bought one for Nana's house and she loves it there too.
+1	my infant daughter is now 2 months old and this has amused her ever since we brought her home from the hospital. we have it set up by her changing table and she inquisitively gazes at the black/white/red/cyan pictures.  in fact its the only toy that she really enjoys as of yet.  when she is older i am sure she will enjoy the other side just as much.
+1	Wow, the best diaper bag we've had!1. Excellent, versatile color!2. Washable material that keeps it's shape and doesn't fade!3. Can look, 'Manly' and 'Feminine' depending on who carries it!4. All the perfect pockets for everything at your fingertips!5. Our friends like it so much, they've bought matching Colorado totes and backpacks!!Can't go wrong with this one, it's one of our favourite baby items! :)
+1	I have no complaints about this bag at all. I use the small, front zippered compartment as my "purse" (and it does have coin compartment, credit card slots, etc.), I love the little clip on the outside... I use that for spare pacifiers for quick access. Avent bottles and Playtex sippy cups fit well in the side pockets. (The bottles have to go on the mesh side, though... that side's slightly larger.) The bag is stain resistant and has stayed clean over the past year.
+1	It is PERFECT for infants or toddlers!  As a new first time mother I carried everything in the house with us when she was a baby!  As a toddler we still have a pretty full bag!  This is the ONLY bag we have found that everything fits in and the bag itself it not huge!The side pockets were great for bottles, sippys or a drink for mom.  The front pouch is perfect to carry clippers, medicine and other small stuff.  The inside pockets are perfect jars of food or for a bottle/sippy for that transition period.  Plus you'll still have room for your wallet, a couple of outfits, toys and anything else you might need.It's also a pretty good color.  It doesn't really show alot of dirty and it washes nicely.  Overall, we love the bag and wish they had it available in more colors!
+1	I read the previous reviews of this bag, so I decided to check it out at our local Babies R Us store.  It really is an awesome bag!  I bought it today, and switched all my stuff into it in the parking lot!  I absolutely love it.  It is very roomy, has pockets for everything, and the purse section (front pocket) is wonderful for organizing mommy's stuff!  There is plenty of room for lots of stuff--I fit 4 small board books, a soft big book, a bunch of teethers, flashcards, a rolie polie olie doll, a Wet Ones canister, my son's shoes, 2 burp rags, a nursing shawl, diapers, wipes, diaper cream, and my personal stuff (wallet, lipsticks, camera)ALL of it comfortably!  The strap is nice and wide so it feels steadier and more comfortable carrying it.  I just love it!  I wish I'd found it sooner because this is bag #3 for us, and our son is only 1!  It seems sturdy so I think it'll last awhile!!  I definitely recommend this bag!
+1	This exersaucer is my duaghter's favorite, and I couldn't live without it!! She is always, and constantly, entertained by it. We began using it when she was 4 months old and she is now almost 7 months and she uses it all day long! There isn't a day that goes by that she doesn't play in it! The toys are very safe, she pulls and tugs and chews on them, without any problems. I've even washed the cloth flag and frog because she saturates them, and they wash easily and hold up beautifully. Cant' say enough about it!
+1	I was really deciding between this one and the Baby Einstien for my now 4 month old son. His 20 month old twin brothers just had an older hand-me down model, but I thought we should get a new one. I really love this exersaucer. At BRU we tried ALL of them. And we really liked this one, and the B.E. When Zach was in this one though, he was the most excited but in the B.E he didnt really like the toys as much. Its super easy to adjust hieght settings, and it was REALLY easy to put together, everything really snaps in place. Its easy to spin the seat and everythings really colorful and always catches his attention. He likes it when we take the pegs off and rock it for him. The toys are all VERY safe, and I just adore the castle theme (my son seems fond of the green frog prince since hes plush and can easily fit part of him in his mouth). The music is really cute, yet not overly annoying. There is room of the "tray" for maybe some cheerios and maybe for my son to hold his favorite plushy. The seat is a very cute pattern and doesnt show stains too much. My son really really loves this, I dont see how anyone could possibly resist this cute and durable, (my 20 month old twins are FOREVER climbing on it) exersaucer!
+1	Two things we didn't like about this incarnation of Evenflo's saucer:1) It has WAY TOO MANY toys surrounding the baby. No wonder you can read here about many experiences of toys to be wary of.2) For a piece of baby gear that will only last your baby until he/she is 12 months, it's too expensive.We compared it side by side with the MegaSaucer (also by Evenflo) at our local Babies 'R Us and settled for the second one, which offers a few more toy options and costs $20 less, while it still keeps our baby very entertained and gives us a little bit of time to get on with breakfast and other 15-20 minute activities without having to hold him all the time.So, while I wouldn't ditch the ExerSaucer - Ultra altogether, I'd encourage you to visit the store and take a hard look at it against the MegaSaucer. I think you will agree, and save yourself $20 and some worries in later months. ;)
+1	My daughter has been playing in this since she was 4 months. Most toys don't hold her attention very long, but she will play in this for 30 min's at the time! It has been a real life saver! My husband is away with the military and I have practicaly been a single mom since she was born. This toy allows me to get household things done. Thank you Evenflo!***do watch the jester though... she has scratched her forehead with it more than once by putting it in her mouth, then letting go... it even got stuck in her mouth one time, lucky i was there to get it out... BUT, if you find a toy dangerous on this... you can always just take it off!!!  I only wish that there were spare toys to order, so I could change them out every once in a while, when she gets bored with one!
+1	We put this on our registry thinking if we get it great, if not oh well.  We LOVE this entertainer.  It's light and portable to go to our family's house and great for our house also.  It keeps our son busy for just enough time to do the dishes or get a shower.  We have a family dinner at my husband's grandma's house every other Sunday and we take either this, our Deluxe Take Along Swing, or our Bumper Jumper with us every time and it keeps him and his cousin busy long enough for everyone to eat and then pick them up again.  We give this saucer an A+
+1	We got this in an attempt to get our little girl to play on her tummy and gain head control.  She perfers her back, but we knew we had to get her to her tummy to play if we ever want her to crawl.  So we looked around and found this.  We love our Boppy pillows and decided to give it a try.  So does ok in it but only for a few minutes.  She seems to get bored with the toys and we have to have other things within her reach or she wants out.  But it has gotten her to where she will lay on her tummy more and she has gained great head control in just a few weeks nd is already working on scooting!
+1	This is a great take-off on the normal boppy (which is also a wonderful invention!).  I like that it's smaller, which is better for propping baby up for tummy time.  I also like that toys attach to the boppy.  I usually add a few more links on, for variety ... but this is not necessary.  Tummy time is such an important part of baby's day, especially because of doctors' suggestions of keeping baby on his back to sleep.  This is a great way to keep tummy time easy and fun!
+1	If you are gonna breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow!!! they are awesome and easy. you can wash them, they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere.Love it!!! ++++
+1	This is a beautiful cover for the boppy pillow.  So soft and luxurious feeling.  I used it for several months without a spare and washed it every few days.  And yet it is still in like-new condition!  Wonderful item, now that I am expecting again, I am buying another one just like it.  :)
+1	Originally, I had purchased a boppy covered in cotton patterned fabric. When I got home and took it out of the package, I realized that the seams weren't sewn very well at the top and stuffing was starting to poke out of the seams!I went back and exchanged it for the plain bopppy & this luxe slipcover... Am I happy I did!!! The velour fabric incredibly soft for my newborn (unlike the stiff cotton of the other one). After having it spit up on and stained, it zipped off and washed up beautifully! Trust me... if you plan on using this to feed your baby, you'll be MUCH happier with this slipcover!!!
+1	I RECEIVED THIS FOR MY BABY SHOWER. IT IS VERY SOFT AND WASHER FRIENDLY. I DO AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE YOUR BOPPY PILLOW PATTERN THROUGH IT THOUGH. I HAVE THE BOPPY YELLOW BEES PILLOW AND IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD WITH THE SLIPCOVER OVER IT. THE BEES ALMOST LOOK KIND OF PURPLE COLORED. A GREAT PRODUCT DEPENDING ON THE PATTERN YOUR PILLOW HAS ON IT.
+1	We knew we were having a girl & when we saw this theme at Babies R Us we knew this was it! We registered for every matching Malawi item available-rug, switchplate, wall art, lamp, nightlight, picture frame, club chair, table & chairs, toy chest, receiving blankets, etc. Went a little crazy, but it all looks so cute-it makes us happy to walk into her room! We painted the wall butter yellow-matching the giraffe & put the border & window valances up-it looks terrific. The sheets wash very well. Get this set-you'll be glad you did!
-1	I would not recommend buying a crib set.  We have this one and it is cute, but I found out after it was purchased that using bumpers is not recommended due to the possibility of suffocation and SIDS.  The valences hang down really low, so we were unable to use them with our blinds.  Babies are also not supposed to sleep with a blanket on top of them, so we have yet to use the comforter.  We did get the rug, found the set of pictures that match, and use the crib skirt.  They are cute in his room.  We did like that this set would work for a boy or a girl too.
+1	My husband and I love this set. We don't know if we are having a boy or a girl, so we wanted something for either and that could grow with our child. The actual colors and fabrics are much prettier than on the website. We painted the walls a medium blue and two dressers, one yellow and one green to match. We purchased animal knobs at a home improvement center for the dressers. I washed the bumpers with Dreft on delicate cycle and hung to dry, they came out beautifully, it held its shape and there were no rips. I washed and dried the sheet on delicate and had no fading and very few wrinkles. I haven't washed any of the other items yet because they won't be touching the baby. (We are hanging the quilt on the wall for now.) We purchased or registered for many of the coordinating accessories, but we like that we can add almost anything animal theme to the room and it fits in nicely. Everyone tells us how gorgeous the room is and we can't wait for the baby to arrive in a couple of weeks to see how he or she likes it.
+1	I like this bedding set.  Our baby loves the animals.  We also got the mobile, the lamp, and the wall hangings.  It's great for a boy or a girl, so you will get lots of use out of it.  The colors are nice and neutral, but cheerful enough for a baby's room!  A great bedding set all around.  The comforter part is kind of impractical, but great as a decoration.
+1	This hamper is so cute and goes very well with the Osh Kosh &quot;Bears Bears Everywhere&quot; border, valences, and bedding set that we picked out.  I like that it folds up easily, and that the inside liner comes out to use like a laundry bag.
+1	We love the hamper. I do not use anything in the nursery more except the changing table. We have the blue one and to spice it up a bit we bought little airplanes (our sons room decor) from Hobby Lobby (any craft store will do) and glued them in place of the buttons. Though after our son was able to start roaming we had to remove them so he would not try to remove them himself and eat them, but by that age we were too busy chasing him to care about decor anymore.The hamper is light, big enough to hold everything yet small enough to put anywhere without being a big trip zone.Another great plus is that you can wash the fabric, huge bonus in my book.
+1	This high-chair was given to us as a gift...and I LOVE it!!!It was purchased in 2002 for my oldest and am very glad to say that we've taken out of storage in 2006 to use on my second!  I didn't want to try any other product...this one is a keeper!!Comfy, secure, durable, long-lasting, etc. etc. etc.
+1	I loved it until it was stolen out of our pickup truck.  I guess it was popular.  It was fast and easy to use.  Great for restaurants.  Cleaner too.  I hate using high chairs.
+1	This product is a great idea, but this was buyer error on our part.  Our eating area was rather small so a high chair would have been a space taker, this product fit the bill EXCEPT we have a lip under the table all the way around and it was useless because by the time our son was ready to sit up and eat his little thighs were too big to squeeze under there (and he wasn't a 'big' baby).  My parents were able to use it with GREAT success for my nephew, so the product itself is wonderful - just MAKE SURE there's no lip!!!
+1	This toy is so pretty!  Even I like to sit and listen to the music with my baby :) My only complaint is that it is too loud.  I got it when my baby was about 3 months old and he was scared of it's lound music at first.  But now at almost seven months he really enjoys it.  I have to put it against the couch though becauce it slide on the carpet and he falls when he holds on to it for support.
+1	My son wasn't so fond of this at first since the music is quite loud, but now he loves it. I love how he can grow with it. It is so versatile, it keeps us both entertained. For the money this is a great buy that will last you years!
+1	What would you pay for a toy that entertains your child, makes them smile and giggle with delight and plays some of the best toy music youve ever heard? Well Id pay a lot more than theprice for this toy!I never thought Id buy a musical toy, they all annoyed me! ButI saw this toy online and checked out the sound at TRU and I bought it. I bought it for my now 6 month old when she turned 3 months and she has loved it from the day we brought it home!I love that this is a toy that will grow with your baby from laying on the floor, sitting to standing. And at each phase the toy performs differently teaching your baby new things.There is absolutly nothing about this toy that we dont like. She plays with it for 20-40 minutes at a time since we gave it to her! Which allowed me to take a shower, eat something, etc.This is a fantastic toy and one that your baby will love and grow into for a long time.
+1	At five months old, this is one of my son's very favorite toys and it has been for about the last two months. Every time he gets bored, we find a new way to play with it.Besides the obvious ways to use this toy, we have also:- arranged the keyboard perpendicular to the floor so that he can use it in his bouncy seat- taken off the legs entirely so that he can sit in our lap and play with it (he likes to sit, but can't on his own yet)- taken off the legs and used it on the floor for tummy time (his current favorite)There are also three musical levels (infant, sitter, and toddler) and two musical types for six different settings. We mix them up for variety. Some of them are more annoying than others, but none are two bad considering how much enjoyment he gets out of this toy.Highly recommended!
+1	This is one of my favorite toys!  My daughter started using this at about two months old.  I'd lie her on the floor and she'd either bat at the hanging toys or kick at them like crazy for minutes on end.  She loved the music and the lights. In fact, the minute I bought the thing out she would smile and squeal with delight.  This toy bought her many hours of joy over the months.When she learned how to crawl we put it into the upright position and she would pull up on it to bang on the keys.  As she learned to cruise she would push it all around the house.  Now that she's a pro walker she still plays with it on occasion but I look back fondly on the days when this is the only toy that could truly captivate her attention.This toy is very durable and I think it's such a small price to pay for something that will most likely bring your child such sheer delight.  I would recommend this to ANYONE at ANYTIME.  It's bound to be a hit in your house, it sure was in mine.
+1	I knew my 3 month old would love this gym since he loves looking at any kind of light.  I purchased this for him and the first time he used it he laid under it for 30 minutes and just stared at the twinkling stars.  I like it because you can angle the "piano" part of it any way you want, so it's easy for a baby who is lying down to see the lights.  The toys that the baby bats at to get the music to play are really cute and the music starts with just the slightest tap, which is great for small babies who aren't very strong.  I did a lot of research on Amazon.com for a gym and since this one got such rave reviews I decided to buy it and I'm so glad I did!!
+1	I did not have this toy at first but after watching a friend's baby playing with it, I went out and bought one for my 5 mnth. old.  She loves hitting the keys already.  The music is so beautiful!!  It keeps her attention for a long time and I love the fact that it will grow with her.
+1	I purchased this toy for my baby when she was just a couple months old. She has always enjoyed playing with it and now at six months she can sit and hit the keyboard. This has always kept her entertained for at least half an hour even from the beginning! It is easy to reconfigure to sitting and standing positions. I like the music and the different modes. Volume control is nice too. It is very good on batteries as well which is a definate plus. The only gripe I have is that the orange mirror pulls off way too easily but other than that this toy is very durable.I'd say this toy is a must have.
-1	I didn't get much use out of this b/c when it was time to switch over to our particular convertible car seat, there was no way to safely anchor the mirror as well (b/c a tether came over the top and side of the car seat to the anchor in back.)So I was going to sell the mirror, but then I touched the mirror with my hand (I guess I had lotion on??) and there was a huge black smear.  So I tried to get the smear off with window cleaner, and that made the whole mirror worse, so now it's all foggy!Also, the remote didn't come even close to fitting on my visor.
+1	I picked this up at Walmart because I needed a mirror to see my daughter while I was driving.  I bought it because it was cute, and it looked like it would be interesting to her.  I remember thinking that the sounds and lights would probably be a useless feature, but I love the rainforest pattern so I bought it anyway.  I finally put the thing in the car about a month later when we were making the four-hour trek to Houston (her first long-ish car trip).  She started getting fussy so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Wow.  That thing put her to sleep almost instantly.  I was amazed.  I was also impressed by battery life.  We've been using it for almost a year and I think I've changed the batteries three times.  Three.  And I only use it when I need it, but it's seen plenty of action.  I'm pretty pleased with battery usage, even with lights and sounds running.  Now that she's closing in on a year, it doesn't put her to sleep anymore, but she still loves dancing to it and it has kept her occupied during 1400+ mile road trips.  I really wish this had been available when our older two were babies.  Our whole family jokes around about the wonders of 'the green button'.  We never make a long trip without it, and I always make sure I pack extra batteries, just in case.  Quite possibly the best $20 I've spent in baby products this time around.
+1	I had orginally purchased the Ocean Wonders Kick N' View and was a bit disappointed in it so I decided to try this one.  It is great!  I have a large SUV and wanted to be able to see my daughter in my rearview mirror while I am driving.  This mirror allows me to do that and she also enjoys looking at herself as well. She enjoys the music and now waits for me to put it on when we get in the car.  The lights are nice for night driving or overcast days.  Definitely worth buying to keep your baby entertained and for you to be able to check on your baby without turning around.
+1	I bought these mirrors for my twins, and I have to say they were great.  I had only one switched on to play music and lights as trying to listen to both of them out of sync can drive a person nuts.  My twins really liked these mirror not only so that they could see me, but also so they could see themselves.  I loved having the remote which allowed me to switch them on and off without having to reach the mirror.
-1	I thought it would be comforting to see my baby when she was rear facing, however as I soon found out if you are ever rear-ended this becomes a very dangerous projectile, that is aimed right at the babies head. I found that several babies are injured like this every year. It just isn't worth it!!!
-1	this was a big waste of money.  remote didnt work and the music was grainy
+1	Being a first time Mommy, I was having minor heart palpatations every time my little daughter made a squeak in the back seat and I could not see her.  I won't confess how many times I actually pulled over on the side of the road to check everything out....oh dear!I bought this, my husband had to prop it up a bit with a little burp cloth tucked underneath to position it correctly, but other than that it works great.  I love it, I can see her very clearly (the mirror is bigger than most) and the music is not too annoying.Great purchase!
-1	I didn't like this because I couldn't see my son in the mirror.  I drive an SUV and I found a bigger mirror instead.
-1	I put the batteries in and nothing works!  No lights, no music, I could have just purchased a $1.99 drugstore mirror and mounted it on the headrest.  I'm especially irked because I live in the Middle East and paid all this money to have it shipped here and it doesn't even work.  What a waste of money.Please note that this actually isn't manufactured by Fisher Price; the name is licensed.  I actually called Fisher Price to tell them that this company, Blue Ridge, is giving Fisher Price a bad name!  I read the reviews on this and knew what I was getting myself into, but thought oh, since I generally have good luck with products, it'll be OK.  Actually, it's not OK!  I emailed Blue Ridge to tell them about this issue.  It seems as though the receiver on the mirror is defective.  We'll see what they have to say.
+1	I love this mobile. The contrast in colors are fantastic and is just what babies are interested in looking at. My son loves looking at the characters and would often stop him from crying when I turn it on.The song plays long enough, although I sometimes have to crank it a 2nd time before my son falls asleep. And there is also a mechanism to stop the mobile if needed for those nights when the baby falls asleep fast.
+1	My son really loves this - he becomes instantly mesmerised when I turnit on. I agree that the music could play just a little longer but, otherwise, he really loves it.
+1	My daughter loves this mobile.  She's still in the bassinet, but in the middle of the night or just when she's cranky, I can put her in the crib, turn on the mobile, and she stops crying.  She is just so enticed by winnie the pooh and all the characters.  She really enjoys herself!Great product!
+1	We have 2 sets of twins, 8 months old and 3 years old. Surprizingly we dont have many gates, just 4, one for the top and bottom of each staircase. These work very well. They were easy to install and do not leave marks on teh walls. They are easy for me and my husband to open and close (even with babies on the hips) but too difficult for my 3 year olds to operate. They are very safe and hold up to much abuse, including my 3 year olds grabbing the bars and shaking it. It serves its purpose, though I didnt try it in a doorway. I dont need any others seeing tha tmy house is VERY baby proof. but these are nice looking easy to use and very sturdy.
-1	We got our gate about 5 years ago.  We used it about a year with our second child.  Well our third is now crawling and we just put it up again.  After 3 days up our lock froze in the stuck position.  I was about to buy the exact same gate since I was pretty happy with it before and I thought the age was the problem until I read the reviews.  This is a problem that needs to be fixed by the manufacture.  I'll be looking for a new gate now!
+1	This is a great gate for stairs!  We live in a 4 level split, and it allows us to keep our toddler in the upper level only and be safe.  The push-and-turn opening mechanism is very easy to use, but kids can't figure it out.  It swings in both directions (if you choose to set it up that way), and opens as easy as turning a doorknob.  The best thing about this gate is that when you're holding a kid in your arms, you just swing the gate closed, and it locks automatically when it's in place.  Also, if baby is sleeping, you can QUIETLY click the gate closed.  Very important!  We're very happy with this.
+1	I bought this stool to use while giving my infant a bath. It helps that it has 2 different heights but I found it difficult to use by my bath tub - not because the stool is inefficient but because I have shower doors instead of a shower curtain. I do find that I use it when I sit down on a chair/couch as a foot stool. I haven't used it to store items in it yet because I don't want it to get heavy. Glad I bought it!
+1	I use this everyday at bath time.  We have a small place and this also adds some storage for soaps or toys. :o)
+1	This seat is much better than the &quot;multi-use bathing cushion&quot;. It's a lot easier to pull baby out of the tub, at a higher height, sitting comfortably, as opposed to being on your knees.  You can adjust the height, and there's no strain on your back or knees! It's a bit bulky in our small bathroom, but it's worth it.
+1	i love this seat.  it holds a lot of weight and stores all i need for her bath and more.  i keep her soaps, toys, towels, and other miscellanious bath items in here.  would recommend it to everyone.  also i love the two height settings
+1	I love this stool, it is perfect size and height to sit next to the tub during bath time, and it fits all of the bath toys too.
-1	I purchased this step stool along with the "Munchkin folding stepstool". I thought this one would be good because of the adjustable height.  The stool arrives set at the lowest setting, and to make it higher, you rotate the top 180 degrees.  An intersting design!  However be warned... the top is somewhat rounded, and if your child steps near the edges the stool will topple and they may fall. This is worse on the HIGHER height.In comparing the two types of stools, the munchkin folding step stool seems much studier (has not tipped yet). Though I am dissapointed in the height of that one.If you are purchasing this simply as a BATH SEAT then it might serve your purpose well.. but as a step stool, there are better options out there... that you can ALSO sit on by the bath!Hope this helps!
+1	I bought this after my wife and I were experiencing discomfort from kneeling or sitting next to the tub while giving a bath to our son.  It is the perfect height for sitting beside the tub helping with a bath.  It also opens to allow for storage of toys or other bath related items.  It is adjustable to two different heights and looks nice in our bathroom.  I would highly recommend to any parents of young ones who need help in the tub.
+1	My toddler loves the stool and I love it since it works as storage as well.  I would recommend it to anyone.
+1	This product is great. I have had back problems in the past and bathing my babies would be painful at times. This has eliminated any back issues caused by bathing the kids. My 20 month old now uses it as a step stool to wash her hands. The only drawback is that it can take up a lot of floor space in a small bathroom. I would definitely buy again.
+1	this tub side seat is great because:1) it is a very roomy storage box for all of your munchkins bathtime toys (with a lid that the munchkin can't take off himself)2) it is a durable seat3) it is a safe stepping stool that doesn't slipit has proved to be very useful.
+1	This takes up a little more room than I thought it would. But bot of my 21 month old boys can use it at the same time, so It works well afterall. I forget about the storage, but is a great idea to help keep bath toys put away
+1	We got this item to use mainly as a step stool for our 14 1/2 month old daughter.  She is working on potty training and we opted for one of the seat instead of a potty.  The step up is still a bit high for her to manage on her own but with a little help from mom or dad she able to manage it.  We were just lifting her up onto the seat but our doctor suggested a step stool just to aid in the process.  She was always proud of herself as were we when she used the potty but this simple and inexpensive item made her 10 times prouder of herself.  WE can tell she really feels like a big girl when she uses it and her potty seat.It's also GREAT for bath time.  We had one of those hook on tubside kneelers and it worked great for us but with age we needed more of a seat than a kneeler.  She loves to play in the water so we were usually sitting on the counter and letting her play.  Well this gives us more height and it wider than the other thing so we're able to sit beside the tub (without sitting in the wet floor) and play with her.  Plus there is room inside it to store a couple of her favorite books for potty time.
+1	This item is perfect for sitting next to the tub while I bath my daughter.  It's easier on your back & knees.  It's also great for holding her bath things.  We love it!
+1	This stepstool/seat/storage is great!!!  I can even put a pink tub in there to travel with and put tub toys, washcloths, lotion, shampoo, rinse cup and more.  It's a lot bigger than I expected and very sturdy.  Excellent purchase to travel with for all bathing needs and then you have a stool for the kids at places like hotels and grandmas house. :)
+1	Out of the 2 seat/stools we've tried, we definitely like this one better.  At first, we used it as a seat while bathing my young son.  Much easier than kneeling or sitting on the edge of the tub.  Now that my son is climbing onto everything, we place this against the couch or bed so he can climb up himself instead of needing us to pick him up onto the couch/bed.
+1	The stool can be adjusted to two heights. It also stores alot of toiletries. I would recommend this.
+1	I registered for this and got it at my baby shower and am so glad I did.  The nurses in the hospital always put my baby on her side to sleep using receiving blankets that were rolled up.  When I got home and used the Rest Assured it was wonderful.  My baby loves it and it is so easy to use and switch baby from side to side when you are laying her down.  It definitely makes me feel more comfortable when laying her down.  I don't have to worry about her choking if she spits up.
+1	My son was a big baby (8.6) and grew out of the Snuggle Nest in a month. Once he started wiggling a bit, he slid down the mattress onto the bed! The item is a bit overpriced. Rest Assured is a good alternative which accomodates more growth.  If you're concerned about suffocating your child, he/she is safer in a bassinet. Since he was my first, I thought I could live without a bassinet, but found that the crib is much to big for a tiny baby. The mattress on the cradle we bought was quite thin and uncomfortable and so next time I will purchase one of those well padded bassinets. I felt badly about buying a bassinet once I had commited to the cradle and as a result my son slept with me for about 2 months on our futon! Some babies seem to want to sleep in your arms ONLY in the first few months, so I am aware that one can't always fault the product! The good news is that he has transitioned to his crib beautifully by 2.5 months, but he will only sleep on his stomach. I was scared at first but he is rolling over now so I no longer am concerned. They tell you not to sleep with your baby or let them sleep on their stomach, but at the end of the day you must do whatever saves your sanity and allows you to function.
-1	The SIDS alliance suggests not using anything in the crib, including any of these sleep positioners or wedges, because the baby could kick his way down and suffocate against the foam bars.  The truth is that you will probably not need it.  Babies naturally sleep on their backs if placed that way.  I was given this as a gift when I was in the hospital and when my doctor saw the box he suggested that I return it.  He said that these things come in and out of style and for some reason have come back in fashion again, but can be a big risk for SIDS- scary!!  My baby is now 4 months old and we have done fine without a product like this.
+1	This is a great thing to have.  I've used it right from the beginning.  She is a squirmy baby and it helps keep her in one spot and gives me a piece of mind during the night.  Also, because the sides are velcro, I can reposition them to make them wider as she grows and put her on her side for daytime naps.  Easy to clean as well, goes right into the washing machine.
+1	Keeps my newborn son in position I put him.  It makes me feel good that my son will not have square head because he always sleeps on one side.
+1	My daughter is five months old and we still use this item!  She sleeps so well and it really works well to keep her positioned correctly.  We love it and highly recommend it.  My niece, who is seven weeks older than my daughter, also loves and still uses hers.
+1	I love this product.  I put it in my baby's bassinet and it keeps him right in the middle of the bassinet.  Plus it's a little softer than than the thin cushion my bassinet came with.
+1	I love my inclined to sleep. I wish I found it sooner! It's comfy and it works great for infants with reflux. I wish it was longer since my 3 month old baby is almost too big for it now. I washed it a few times and it held up well. It's great for cosleeping and for nursing in bed.
-1	I registered for this product and received it at my baby shower.  I thought it would be wonderful.  I was wrong.  My daughter who was 8 pounds 11 ounces at birth would slide down the Inclined to Sleep positioner.  In fact, a few times I would go in to check on her and her head would be in between the two foam sides.  SCARY!  This started happening after about 3 weeks of age.  Until this age she was fine with it...but by 3 weeks...she was wiggling and moving too much to use the pillow part.  I am thankful that nothing happened to her when she sild down the pillow.  Because of this safety issue I would never reccommend this product to anyone.  It's not worth the risk.
+1	I love this product, not only because it keeps my baby safe while she sleeps, but it also keeps the blanket on her!  She likes to kick the blanket off while she's sleeping, then she wakes up and her poor little feet are freezing cold!  So I tuck her blanket in all around her under the sleep positioner mat, and it's almost impossible for her to kick the covers off!  This is a must have for all new parents and babies!
+1	My daughter is a month old and she has been sleeping on it since we got home from the hospital.  I like it because she looks comfy on it and it keeps her on her side.  She is starting to get a little long for it, but that's OK because she sleeps just fine.  She hasn't had a problem sliding down at all and even though I'm a worried first time mom, I put her to sleep on it while she's in her bassinet.  I only gave it 4 stars because it's looking kinda haggered.
+1	My triplets were born at 33 weeks and from the beginning they did great.  Except that the biggest (4 lbs 9 oz) had reflux almost after every feeding.  It was so bad that when it happened he would scare himself and would not be able to go back to sleep without being held and rocked.When you have to feed 3 babies every 3 hours, holding a baby and rocking him back to sleep, cuts down on your sleep.We bought the Inclined to Sleep.  During the first night, after his first two feedings he was reflux free and at his last night time feeding he had a minimal episode, which he quickly returned to sleep afterwards.We did cover the head area with a cloth to catch any spit up.  He did slide down after having an episode of reflux.  When babies get reflux it hurts.  Babies arch their backs to try to get away from the pain and that is usually when they start to slide down the wedge.  I never have any concerns with my baby sliding down and pressing his nose against the side barriers because I am right there to clean him up.  .I would highly recommend this product to parents that have babies with reflux.  It may not prevent your baby from having reflux but it does cut down on the episodes and brings comfort to your baby.
-1	The first night I tried this, my newborn slid down in between the bumpers.  This product is dangerous.
+1	I only found this useful for about the first month. But when you're a new mother, the thought of something tragic happening because he wasn't on his back was enough for me to buy it. It also gave some extra cushion too. It looked a bit cozier than the flat bassinet bottom.  However, looking back I think he would have been ok without it. Newborns don't move very much anyway when they're all bundled up.
-1	We have this positioner in the porta crib and the Air Flow positioner in the bassinet. The Inclined to Sleep positioner isn't our favorite because our 3 week old slides down in it while sleeping and wakes up crying and uncomfortable. (This doesn't happen in the Air Flow which is 1/2 the price!) The Inclined to Sleep looks comfortable, but not when the little one wakes up crying and uncomfortable!
-1	I am not too impressed with this product. It was okay for the first week, but then my son started to slide up or down and would not even be on it by the time he woke up, which defeated the purpose. The sides do not attach very well to begin with and definitely are not helpful if the baby scoots during sleep. Another problem is with washing it. It is very hard to get the cover back on once you take it off. It is like it doesn't fit properly. My son is 5 weeks old and I stopped using this 3 1/2 weeks ago. Don't waste your money!
-1	I registered for this item before my son was born because I was a nervous first-time mom who, like many, was terrified of SIDS.  I wanted to make sure that my baby would be safely positioned on his back and would not inadvertently roll over during the night.  What nobody told me was that my baby would not roll over as a young infant (because he simply was not strong enough yet), and that he would also wiggle around in a sleep positioner and end up in a very different place than where I left him.I used the sleep positioner in a bassinet right next to our bed, and I frequently found my baby scrunched up at the bottom of the positioner against the base of the bassinet.  Once, I found him with his head hanging precariously over the top edge.  After that, I took the sleep positioner out of the bassinet.  I used it for a grand total of 6 weeks.  Knowing what I know now, I don't think I will be using it for my next child.  I know now that my young infant will be able to stay on his/her back without artificial aids.  I know now that babies slide down inclined surfaces.  And I know now that the SIDS Alliance recommends NOT using sleep positioners in your child's crib.  So I would recommend passing on the sleep positioners (unless instructed otherwise by your pediatrician), and making sure your child's sleeping environment is as safe as possible.
+1	This item was a lifesaver. My baby wouldn't sleep in the co sleeper b/c that matress is hard and he just looked so uncomfortable all swaddeled and his head would lean back when I put him down. Once I bought this, it made him so comfortable he falls asleep. I also use it in his Moses basket. He did spit up some gas medicine on it and it's stained, so that isn't good and he does slide down but I don't know if that is the products fault or the babies. It's a good product, I wish it was a little less $$ so I could buy more. Overall, great buy.
-1	This product doesn't get the job done. My son slid down it every night. I finally gave up. Also not matter how I placed the side things he always mannaged to roll onto his side. Once he got older ( 2 months) if he wasn't sliding down it, he was pushing himself up it. Then his head fell off of the top and got wedged in between this and the bumper! That is when I stopped using it.It's a great concept, just not practical.
+1	I REALLY AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT EXCEPT HAVING TO PUT THE COVER BACK ON IT AFTER WASHING. IT IS DIFFICULT TO STUFF THE FOAM INTO IT. I AM GOING TO TRY THE OTHER REVIEWER'S SUGGESTION ABOUT PUTTING THE SHEET OVER THE FOAM INSTEAD.
+1	I have a week old baby and he falls right asleep in this.  I put the side guards close enough together for him to feel really snug so he feels like someone is still holding him.  I'm able to put him down and hold the sides close together and rock him for a few seconds and he falls asleep really fast.  I feel more secure knowing that he's nice and secure in his basinet.
-1	Both of my daughters slid right down the positioner.  So I stopped using it right away. I do not recommend this product at all.
+1	My baby struggles badly with reflux and has since he was 4 weeks old.  This positioner has helped in many ways:He came home from the hospital with jaundice and had to be hooked upto a UV machine at all times for just over a week.  Because of the short reach on the tube, we had to lay him down to sleep on our couch.  This product kept him in place the entire time and kept him safe while he slept somewhere besides his crib.In his early days, I would swaddle him and put him on his side.  Not only was he able to sleep more soundly but I also had the relief in knowing he was not going to choke sleeping on his back.He was also struggling with spitting up every time I would lay him down to change his diaper.  I have the contoured changing pad and I purchased another inclined sleeper to put under the changing pad cover to keep him more upright when I change him.Now that he is 4 months old, he has learned how move around in his sleep and he slides down on the wedge but I still couldn't live without it under the changing pad.
-1	Tried to use it several times but my daughter hated it.  I could tell that she was not very comfortable.  It did not allow her to move her arms where she wanted to.  Also it is very small in size.  If she did like it,  it would not have lasted very long.
+1	What would we have done without this??  We have a corner crib, so mattress lifters didn't fit.  This was PERFECT!  It kept our little one in an inclined position all night so that we did not have any sleeping difficulties.  We went from awake every two hours cleaning up spit up, to sleeping for 4 to 5 hours at a time.  What a blessing!
+1	Purchased for the upstairs nursery, it has saved me from stumbling downstairs to the kitchen for late night/early morning feedings. Fits the Avent as well as the thinner bottles. I recommend using the caps that come with your bottles when you warm up junior's food (repels the condensation).I'd give it five stars, but the beeps are a feature that I wish could be turned off by the user - note to Munchkin.Worth every penny.
+1	This is actually pretty good! I use it for warming breastmilk & formula. It took a few tries to get it perfect temperature, but I have never had too-hot milk, so my baby didn't get hurt. There were a few times where the milk wasn't too warm - but didn't take long. My measuring cup's markings did rub off after 2 months, and I contacted Munchkin and they sent me a new one for free.
+1	We have two of these things (one in F150 and one in Mitsubishi Galant). We never take them out and just swap the baby car seat into the base of whichever car we're driving (with baby). My only concern is it does &#34;press&#34; quite hard into the seats with the plastic corners and ultimately could lead to depressions in the seat long term. However, it is quite well designed and once you figure out how to adjust it (no red should show!!!) then you set it and forget it. The carseat pops down really easily and you can audibly hear the &#34;click&#34; of the lock/latch. It's quite forgiving and easy for my (5' 7&#34; tall) to get even into the tall truck. I usually just swing the car seat close and wiggle until it's in place. Would purchase again in a heartbeat...I'd recommend one for every vehicle, although we have swapped them into other vehicles (Toyota Venza) on the fly (less than 2 minutes) when I got a flat tire and grandparents picked us up on interstate...thank God these change out quickly as not a safe location for swapping. I do feel they're very secure, but at first it's supprising how the front end appears it could &#34;bounce&#34; up and down quickly with know restraint in the front.
+1	We purchased this from Amazon.com after buying a carseat (and single base) at Babies R Us.  Between the time we got the carseat/stroller combo (Graco Alano Flipit) and decided we wanted an additional car seat base, Babies R Us had discontinued this model.  Apparently there are two Graco carseat bases -- we purchased the remaining in-stock product, only to discover that it did not fit our carseat.  So, make sure this is the proper base for your carseat before ordering.  While the product seems to work fine (once you get the right model) -- it is a hassle to end up with the wrong model.  I can't believe how quickly these things get discontinued -- we had only purchased the carseat itself a month prior to our attempt to get this base.  A model compatibility chart would be really helpful, but in lieu of that, make sure to examine the picture of this product to make sure it looks right before ordering.Overall, we were very pleased with the service from Amazon.com -- the price was better than Babies R Us (when the product was still carried, that is)... and Amazon.com allowed us to get the second carseat base that we would not have otherwise been able to get.
+1	Getting a second car seat base is a good idea if you like to switch cars with your partner a lot
+1	My friend and I were out shopping for a complete travel system to prepare for my new baby, and we picked out the Graco Travel System. Now, I'm an "old mommy" who had a second baby at age 43 (surprise!), and I have been so impressed with this travel system. The base is SUPER EASY to install, and the matching stroller actually folds up in ONE FAST STEP with a "magic button" making this the best stroller I've ever had. You can get one of the Graco travel systems in a variety of colors, and it's so easy to buy additional parts (in my case, I was here looking for a second car seat base and found it)!  Better yet, I had an Amazon Reward, and my total cost for this second base was ONLY $4.94.How in the world can you beat a deal like this?  I love Graco products, and Amazon.com ROCKS!!!!
+1	I have to say that I want to thank Graco for thinking of the parents!!!This is probably the most innovative invention that anyone could have made.  I love the fact that we don't have to move the base from car to car every time we change cars.  This also saves us from having to buy a second seat for convenience.Also, I love that I can just unlatch the carseat from the base and carry her inside in the seat.  It keeps the seat from getting cold in the winter time since you can take it inside with you!Everyone should have one!!!
+1	So glad to have an extra car seat base for our second vehicle. Easy to install and fits our SnugRide Classic. Exactly as expected.
+1	I gotta say, I don't know what much there is to say about this product.  I find the SnugRide car seats to be very nice and basic and have been so far happy with mine.  All that was lacking was another base to stick in another car.  I find this easy to install once I got the concept down and really quite secure.  I enjoy being able to use the LATCH system or simply the seatbelt.  It's a light, yet sturdy base that does everything the original car seat base does.  Great product to add to your various Graco systems.
-1	We went with the Graco Snugride because it received good safety ratings and fit our budget. Our newborn son fit nicely in it and seemed secure - the first few times. After the first couple of months I started to notice some definite drawbacks:1) It is NOT particularly lightweight, and even though my son was a smaller baby, it still got really heavy really fast. After about 3mos. I refused to use it anymore. We put it in hubby's car and put the convertible seat in mine.2) The straps adjust from behind, and they are the kind that need to be threaded individually. So, if the season changes (or you just live in a variable region like we do) you'll find yourself fighting with it every time your child wears anything heavier than a onesie. THEN you have to re-thread again on the next warm (lighter clothes) day. And trust me - trying to adjust those things when you're in a hurry to be somewhere will frazzle your nerves in no time!3) The handle was not very steady. What I mean is, these seats are pushed and pulled constantly, usually at a sideways angle in and out of the car or at your hip. I found that after just a few trips, the handle felt loose and would rock a little from side to side, and even back & forth slightly when supposedly locked in place.4) Last thing, but definitely my biggest concern. The anchor strap slips! You don't notice it the first few times, and you probably won't ever notice it unless you ride in the back seat or test it occasionally. Because it was in my husband's car, we didn't notice it at first. Then I rode back there one day and found that the base was sliding like crazy - the BASE! The strap (it was the LATCH strap) had gradually gotten looser and looser, even though we used a towel to even out the seat (as recommended) and pulled the strap as tight as humanly possible. We fixed it, then found that several weeks later it was loose again!I would accept that the loose strap thing was a fluke of this particular seat (since I've never heard anybody else complain of it), but taken as a whole we will NOT be using this seat again. Go with Britax or Chicco!
+1	This is pretty much a must-have for infant seats, I don't know why they don't just sell them together. Bases are great because you secure the base once with the seatbelt, then just pop the car seat/carrier in and out with a simple little latch. It also makes switching between other cars that have the same base a breeze. Definitely get this!
+1	this is great to put in a second vehicle like grandmas, so you can just pop the infant car seat in and out, and the car seat is already securely installed.
+1	It took us almost an hour to figure out how to get the thing CORRECTLY installed in the car the first time.  Although it was easy to get it in there, that didn't mean it was CORRECTLY installed.Since both of us drive baby places in our cars, we really needed another base.  Putting baby in teh car now takes about two seconds.  We are considering buying one for the babysitter and even the friend who occasinally picks up baby from daycare.Definately worth AT LEAST $40.00.
+1	Works well ... just like it should.  Easy to snap in and out of.  We have two extra bases because it's sooo much easier to have one in every car than to change them out all the time.
+1	Love that I found this.  They don't make these any more, but I needed this base for the grandparents cars.
+1	We have 3 of them and have no complaints. I keep one in my car, one in my husbands, and have another for travel.  It's super easy to snap the carrier onto it, and very easy to install in any car.  I just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old, and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars. I could use the latch, or just use the seatbelt for older cars.  I was worried that I would need my husband's help with the installation, but I was fine on my own just reading the directions. I recommend this for everyone!
+1	We really liked the idea of having the base, especially since one of us does drop off and the other does pick-up at daycare.  We left the carrier with the baby, and it went from base to base.  The only reason we don't give it a perfect rating is, as some others have noted, it does tend to get loose after a while and needs to be retightened, and was hard on Marcus' back when he had to reach in and lift teh baby and carrier out of the Honda.  It was a little better with the station wagon. This is probably not an issue for mini-van or SUV drivers.
+1	We needed an extra base for my sister who watches my daughter and it works exactly like the base that came with our travel system.  According to our local consignment shops, they are not allowed to sell used bases anymore, so if you need an extra base for a Graco SnugRide Travel System, this is what you want to get.
+1	Love these bases.  We bought just one infant car seat, and then two extra bases that are easy to keep in grandma's and husband's cars.
+1	This makes it very convenient to use the car seat in two cars without having to mess with the seat belt.  Snap in and snap out quickly and easily.
+1	and was afraid this wouldn't work with the model I had. After some online research I was fairly confident it would and am happy to say it does. It is very different from the original base, but I actually think it is better. Good value for the price.
-1	Folks, I am NOT kidding! A local TV channel 3 affiliate here in Ohio ran a story the other day about a couple that had one of these that greatly malfunctioned.  The new mom interviewed said that the product started emitting a burning smell, and when she looked down at it, she couldn't believe her eyes... the plastic around where the power cord plugs in was completely melted!  Then to add insult to injury, they claimed that Evenflo would take a while to send them back their refund.  Perhaps this was a 'fluke', but I felt obligated to tell all of you about this.  My wife is expecting our first child in August, and we will be looking at breast pumps as well.  But not Evenflo.
+1	I received this pump as a gift at a baby shower for my first child (2 years ago). I wasn't looking forward to pumping, but when I finally tried this out, I was amazed.Pros:it didn't hurt (i had been told pumping hurt)it was easy to cleanI got 3-4 ounces within 10-15 minutesCons:it is a little loudit slowly lost suction over a few months time and stopped working by the time my daughter was 5 months old.Since this no longer worked, I found another pump for my second child. I did researched and found a pump that others recommended highly. I hate it, hate it hate it. It pinches slightly, there is no way to adjust the fit, it takes 40 minutes to get 1 ounce, its a pain to clean. It also still works after 7 month.MY CONCLUSION: BETTER RESULTS AND THE PRICE WORKS OUT TO ABOUT THE SAMEI miss my inexpensive Evenflo pump. The way I see it now is.. even if I had to replace this one (at $50 each purchase) every 4 months (that would be 3 times in a year), Its still a better deal then some of the more expensive ones. that would be $150 toward pumps that worked well for me but needed replaced often instead of $150-400 on pumps that don't work for me and last the whole year.I'm currently thinking of asking my husband to 'reinvest' in this one and using my more expensive one as a backup.
-1	I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PUMP. I'M A FIRST TIME MOM AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT IN SOME CASES SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY WITH BABY SUPPLIES. IN THE HOSPITAL I WAS SUPPLIED WITH A MEDELA HARMONY PUMP TO USE AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT, I THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK THE SAME AT HOME. I WAS VERY WRONG!!! I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN AND WE HAD A 3 HOUR RIDE HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL. BY THE TIME WE ARRIVED HOME I WAS VERY ENGORGED AND DESPERATE. MY NEWBORN HAD LATCHING ON PROBLEMS AT FIRST SO AS SOON AS WE GOT HOME I ASSEMBLED THE PUMP AND SAT DOWN TO USE IT. NOTHING HAPPENED. I THOUGHT I WAS HAVING LETDOWN PROBLEMS SO I TRIED HAND EXPRESSING AND WAS SUPRISED TO FIND THAT I WAS SPRAYING MILK EVERYWHERE! THERE WAS JUST NOT ENOUGH POWER TO PULL OUT THE MILK. I WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT WASTING MY MONEY. IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS A RETURNABLE ITEM. LUCKILY THE HOSPITAL HAD SENT ME HOME WITH A MEDELA MANUAL PUMP AND THAT WORKED GREAT UNTIL I COULD FIND A DECENT RENTAL. PLEASE LISTEN TO THE LOW RATINGS ON THIS PUMP. I DIDN'T AND I REGRET IT. I COULD'VE SPENT THE ADDITIONAL MONEY AND PURCHASED A GOOD RECOMMENDED PUMP. I ENDED UP THROWING THIS PUMP AWAY AND I CRINGED WHEN I DID IT, IT FELT SO WASTEFUL!
+1	I originally had a Medela Swing, which was ok. It was my first pump, so I didn't know any better. But when we out of town, my pump stopped working because it shorted out (my dog had bitten thru the wire, and when my husband tried to re-connect the wires, it died). Anyway, I needed a pump badly, we went to Wal-Mart and bought this one because it was a cheap fix. When I first used it, it felt sort of violent at first because I was used to my Medela,which is very gentle. But it was only because I wasn't used to the Even Flo. Well, I was amazed at the amount of milk I got in such a short amount of time (a full 5 oz in maybe 10 minutes!!!but I was pretty engorged, too). I think it's much more efficient since there is no tubing, which can reduce the suction power. I havent had any problems with the pump at all, and am very happy with this purchase and price. The breast pads that came with it are terrible, though, and I stick to Lansinoh pads, which ROCK! They don't leak at all, even in the morning when I tend to be full. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is pretty loud, and the flanges only come in one size.
+1	I bought these baskets for storage. One is in my dresser/changing table holding some of my diapers. The other is in my daughters bathroom holding her towels and washclothes. I like these baskets a lot. But you can get them for less money at trgt, about 5-10 dollars less.
+1	I think these baskets are great.  I have 4 of them stocked on my changing table.  I have them filled with diapers, receiving blankets, bibs, burp cloths, bath supplies, etc.  All of it is easily accessible and they look adorable.  I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 only because the first set that I bought I had to fix.  Be careful with the ties on the liners.  The ties on one of mine broke as I was trying to tie the bow.  Our Babies R Us hardly ever has them in stock so instead of returning it and waiting for more to come in, I had to restring the tie through the liner and sew it back together.  A little bit of work but I am still happy with my purchase overall.
+1	These baskets are great. I first had bought a more expensive set but ended up taking them back when i seen these. The white matches my daughters furniture. I ended up ordering 2 sets in pink and then for my son i ordered 1 set in blue. I keep things like extra diapers and wipes. Onesies, blankets, towels, wash clothes, dirty cloth. They each have their own baskets in their bathroom for bathtime with their towels, cloths, lotions, soaps and toys. They will come in VERY handy for when we can use them to store their toys in when they become more active. They store GREAT in the bathroom closet and also a perfect fit on the changing table. They would also fit perfect under the crib.
-1	I got this hamper as a gift. I returned it the next day. The white paint chips off all over.
+1	I registerd for this diaper bag, because I was loving all the new baby pooh things.  This is the only diaper bag I am and have used since my daughter was born Sept 22, 2003. Not problems, alot of room! No rips tears or snags! Seems like it will last a real long time! Daddy isn't embarrsed to carry it either!
+1	I love this diaper bag! Its so cute and hold just the right ammount of stuff for my 1 month old son!  I have a few other diaper bags too and i use this one because of the great storage! I like how the sides have zippered pockets as opposed to others that only have open pockets.  And this fits under my stroller just fine!AFTER USING THIS BAG ONLY A FEW TIMES THE LINER CAME UNDONE FROM THE TOP AROUND THE ZIPPER SO THE FOAM PADDING IN IT WAS COMING OUT.  GOOD FOR LIGHT USE BUT DONT PACK IT FULL OF STUFF AS I DID, THE STITCHING WONT HOLD UP.
+1	This Diaper bag is nice and roomy. I can fit in all the bottles, diapers, and extra clothing items in this bag neatly without a lot of fuss. And the weight of the bag is perfect for additions so that it is not overly heavy when I do add items to it. The strap is nice and wide so there is "little slip off the shoulder" problems with the bag. The design is very cute, even daddy doesn't mind carrying it. I have a little girl, and eventhough it is baby blue the characters are cute enough for either baby use. The bag also comes with a changing pad in it's own individual slot in the front, so there is no digging for it when you need to change baby fast.This is a perfect gift and it doesn't cost a lot, not exactly stylish for conservatives, but for the new mommy who is on the go this bag is perfect (great for a registry item too).
+1	This monitor is great.  I really like the features that it offers.  Not only does it have lights that light up when Baby cries, it can also vibrate (if you have that option turned on) when Baby cries, so you'll know even while running the vacuum. I like how the battery on the parents' unit is rechargeable, all you have to do is plug it in.  This monitor picks of up every sound, which is great to have with a little one.
+1	I had to turn this thing off at night because I hear everything, including my neighbors, people outside, and if a car drives by it sounds like it is coming through the house. maybe 900 mhz is too much.
+1	We have this monitor for our 12 mo. old daughter.  At first we had a First Years monitor but the reception was terrible so we exchanged it for this Fisher Price model.  The reception on this one is crystal clear.  I like the light and vibration features- I can see if she's crying if I am in the shower by looking at the lights.  We have never had one problem with it.  We now have another First Years monitor for our 1 mo. old- it has a lot of static just like the previous one (we should have learned our lesson the first time)- we are going to return it for another Fisher Price monitor.Update: We bought this monitor again for our son- like the other, it is crystal clear.  This is the BEST monitor!
+1	I really like this monitor. It works and there is not any feedback and we're in a small place. I also like the ability to use the batteries and put it on your belt. We use it if we go take the dog out or to do yard work while she's sleeping. I would recommend this.
+1	By reading the other reviews, I wonder.... To me this is the ONLY thing I could use.  I hate the idea of the baby soaking in the same water I used to washed her.  We have a pot with warm water next to me and sat the baby bather on my bathroom sink.  I closed the door and kept the bathroom warm until we were done.  We have a big bathroom and I dressed her on the ocuntertop.Now she is 6 months and I still sit her on it.  Now I use an inflatable tub underneath it.  still the water runs out into the sink, but the countertop is too hard so we take her into the room to dress her.  For me, this is a great product!AHH! when we know we will be outdoors, we use it as our baby's chair.  since it is meshy, it helps her stay cool.  She is a summer baby.
+1	I am a first time mom and have never used another bather for my two and a half month old.  It's easy to store, dries fast, and my baby seems very comfy in it.  It fits nicely in my sink and its mesh fabric allows water to flow through.  After reading other reviews, I want to try it in the bath with me and see how baby and I like it!
+1	This seat makes bathing even the squirmiest baby quick and easy.  It's mesh, so it's not uncomfortable for the baby like the other hard, plastic tubs out there.  When pouring water on the baby, it drains right through the mesh.  The seat dries fast, and doesn't grow mold or mildew.
-1	This seat is not at all sturdy.  The bottom portion will not stay down, and I'm not about to put my baby into it.  I bought it yesterday, and I'm returning it tomorrow.  It does not seem safe at all.  It is so light that it seems like the baby could easily tip over.
+1	I previously used a set that featured Sculpey material to make hand and foot print casts. The Sculpey material is a little firm, and with those soft little baby hands I was too nervous to push them hard into the material, so I only got fairly shallow impressions.With THIS set - the Babyprints brand - the material is different. You don't bake it, it just air dries. It is much softer, so you can get a deeper, nicer casting. However, it seems to stay a little soft even after setting. I'm not sure whether it will survive the ages as well as the Sculpey stuff does.
-1	This product is worthless! I had to try and "lightly press" my daughters foot into the plaster no less than 9 times and each time it barely made an indentation.  We tried everything, from rolling the plaster a little thicker for more cushion while pushing, pressing her foot a little harder and nothing worked.  We could have thrown our $30 for this product out the car window and gotten more satisfaction and a better memory than this piece of junk will provide.  We ended up with a very faint, almost unreconizable imprint that will most likely be replaced with an ink impression if we can find it soon enough.  Save your money and buy something else if you really want a true memory of your child's foot or hand.**UPDATE: I emailed the manufacturer Pearhead, after receiving this product.  They sent another plaster packet out and we tried it again.  We followed the directions as noted and it still did not work.  We again were left with a horrible, barely there print.  This product truley is a waste of money.  We ended up ordering the Inkless print kit from another company for much cheaper, worked great and we got the keepsake this product/company could not deliver on.
+1	I purchased this to give my husband for his first Father's Day & he absolutely loved it! I had a hard time getting the hand print to stick with the double-sided tape & it kept falling in the frame. I was desperate for a quick solution & put some jewelry glue (the ONLY kind of glue I had) on the back of it, and it's been sitting in place ever since. I'm thinking of purchasing another one for the grandparents next!
+1	This was a gift for a friend. She said the clay was very easy to work with and after the first failed attempt to get her infant's foot mark she was able to re-roll the clay to set it again.I viewed the end product and it looks very nice.
-1	Bought this two years ago for my first son and it worked great. This time, the clay to keep the impression was awful. Not sure how to describe it, but it wouldn't allow for a visible footprint. Sent it back and got a new one. Same problem. Must be an error in the current production. Do not buy. I ended up using an online recipe to make my own with salt and flour.
+1	People told us that this was a "heavy" car seat.. in truth.. they all are around the same weight --- it is the child who gets heavier... This has been a great item... Would use it again.
-1	My husband and I were ecstatic when we received a Peg Perego travel system for our shower.  We love the stroller and infant seat together, BUT the infant seat base is unable to be installed properly in our Subaru Forester.  Our seatbelts are too thin and the accessory that is supposed to take care of this problem is to large to properly fit on the belt between the base and the latch.  As a result, the carseat slides from side to side.  The fire dept. personnel has recommended we not use the infant seat in our car.
+1	My wife and I purchased this in preparation for the arrival of our son.  We knew that we needed something to protect the seat when we install his car seat so this set was the solution.  Thus far, it's done the job.
+1	great fit in my 2006 Malibu and it helps prevent the car seat from digging in. like that its also meant for when the kid gets older. great investment.
+1	This mat is great, but the only problem we had was that the mats smelled really BAD (chemical smell) initially.  We aired them out for about a week, and then the smell was much less toxic.
+1	We have tan leather seats in the car so this offered the best colour option and looked the least hideous.  So far, it has not damaged our leather seats. The only con is that the top piece is a bit small.
+1	I own 3 of these and so glad I do.  They definitely do the job and then some.  I wouldn't put a car seat in my car without one of these.  Grey blends in well with our honda grey leather seats.
+1	This seat protector has been great at keeping seats looking new and catching snacks the little one has dropped!  Easy to clean too.
+1	This product is doing what it is supposed to do--protect my leather car seats!  BUT, the top half and the bottom half are two slightly different colors.  They aren't quite tan--one piece is actually sort of gray.  (I think it is the bottom...I can't remember)  I actually returned the first one I received because it was so obviously mismatched; I thought it was a packaging error.  But after checking the same product at a local baby store, it became obvious it was just the way the manufacturer made it.  A bit weird, if you ask me.  But better than the actual gray one.So, if having it be two different colors doesn't bother you, go for it.  It works well.The only thing I wish were different is that the back piece could be taller.  It doesn't cover the entire back of the seat, so our Britax Marathon digs into the car's upholstery a bit.
+1	Grandma was not ready to give up leather seating in her car and wanted something to protect the leather from damage when a booster seat was installed.  The Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver seemed to be what I was looking for.  Not only was it somewhat more rigid than other seat protectors, but it came in tan so that it matched my car's interior.  Additionally, since I live in south Texas, the lighter color is more desirable for purposes of keeping the vehicle's interior from getting so hot.  There should be no issue with the seat saver staining the lighter leather black as, based on reviewers' comments, some other brands do.The Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver was easy to install.  The base filled one of the back "bucket" seats; the seat saver's back needed to have been about 4" longer to completely protect the booster seat back from coming in contact with the vehicle's seat.  Further, it would have been helpful if each side of the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver had tabs that extended over the seat back.  That would have prevented the booster seat straps from digging into the vehicle's seat when the booster seat was correctly installed.  Because of the vehicle's seat depth, the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver's front flap does not "bend" at the marked area, but still provides a bit of protection to the seat edge.  Having a little one who likes to "drum" his feet makes me appreciate this feature; I do wish the flap had been a bit longer and had multiple grooves for bending.There was no sliding of the Britax Frontier 85 SICT Booster Seat which was installed on this seat saver; the booster seat held firmly in place.  The backing on the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver is a rubber-like mesh, similar to the material used to keep floor rugs from sliding.  Since I have not yet had the seat in place during one of our very hot Texas summers, I do not know whether there will be a sticking problem.  I will probably remove the booster seat during the summer unless our little one is visiting so that I can avoid this potential problem.I would have rated the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver a 4.5, if that rating had been available.  With the exception of the suggested changes, I am very pleased with this product.
+1	Keeps my beautiful tan Napa leather nice and clean. Blends in nicely too. It is made of very sturdy and water proof material. I highly recommend this for people with toddlers who love to snack in the car. Clean up is a breeze.
+1	I had to buy a new car when I got pregnant. It had brand new tan leather so I bought this to protect the seats. They first of all, work great at the protecting...however, they blend in so well they are hardly noticeable. Works so good I bought another one for my second baby's car seat.
+1	This is great.  Unlike other car seat protectors this is heavy duty and won't cause the car seat to leave marks on your seats through the protector
+1	Works just fine with no issues in my 2013 Mazda CX-9.  Recommended, and I would buy again.  Keeps the seat clean and tidy.
+1	This is one of the few seat covers without odd sticky stuff on the back that will ruin leather seats! I love that it comes up the back and protected my seat from my rear facing tall guy.Highly recommend, have in all cars.
+1	Recently my husband and I purchased a Saab 9-5 wagon, our first car we bought together, and it is gorgeous, so we'd like to keep it that way.  I wasn't even looking for a seat protector, I just happened to stumble upon this on Amazon, so after reading ALL the reviews for ALL of the seat protectors, I chose this one.  No complaints!  It's made of a thick, stiff "foam" to protect the leather seat from indents from our daughter's car seat.  I very much appreciate the "kick guard" as well, as we have a kicker.  :-)  The seat protector wide and tall, so it's big enough to prevent indents from our "convertible" toddler/child car seat, the Eddie Bauer High Back Booster, 22-80 lbs, so we should get many years of use from this seat protector, so it's well worth the money.
+1	This works great for protecting your cars interior from a car seat base.  I am happy with this purchase and recommend this product.
+1	I purchased one of these 4 years ago, just before my first child was born.It's still in use in our SUV. I have a 1.5 year old also and did not put one of these under her car seat. Needless to say - it's a lot harder to get her car seat installed evenly, and I recently removed both kids' car seats and was surprised at how deep the indentation was on the side that didn't have one of these installed, so I went ahead and bought another.I love that these protect the seats, not just from dust and debris, but from deep indentations caused by car seats. They hold up really well to use. Ours has been used for the last 3.5 years and it still looks almost like new.It's a small price to pay for what you get. Don't hesitate to buy this.
+1	This protector does the job on preventing dents in leather seats.Remember that these days any type of professional is afraid of a lawsuit, and do not want to use any type of aftermarket product that could interfere with their "professional" installation. That is why no one will approve these mats, or even cupholders on strollers anymore!!!As a carseat safety fanatic, and being pretty educated on carseat installations I felt confident that I could make a decision if this was inhibiting a proper installation. I see no problems. To be sure the carseat is strapped in super tight, I sit in it as I pull the straps. It doesn't budge one centimeter left or right, or front to back.This saver was easy to put in the car, and did not need to be adjusted a million times as I tightened in the carseat using LATCH & tether (we use the Britax Marathon). A previous saver bunched and made installation impossible, but this one is very thin, firm and stays put. The add on back was the perfect height, and did not block the tether strap in our F150. It also stayed upright as I put the carseat into place.This blends in nicely with our black seats and looks good. It's available in three colors - black, tan, and grey. Let's face it - if you're interested in this product it's because you care how things will look long term!This saver is a great combo of safety and function. While it may not perform perfectly with every single carseat/car combination - if your seat is moving more than an inch in any direction it's not installed correctly whether you are using seat saver or not!
+1	I've only used the infant car seat part so far.  Very sturdy material, easy to install.  It's a bit wide though, so it might interfere with the seat belts next to it (especially if you're using the middle seat).  I haven't had any issues with the saver causing the car seat to slide.  It has an non-sliding mat at the bottom that helps maintain it in place.  Overall, this seat saver does the job of protecting my car, and it's amongst the better products I've seen for it.  Great price from Amazon, don't regret this purchase.
+1	Have used these in a Subaru Outback and a Toyota Sienna.  They fit well in the seats and protect the leather.  They have not worn out yet after over two years of use.  Still in great shape.
+1	This is a great idea and I can see how it would be convient to protect your seats but it doesnt work well if your seats in your car do not have a gap to slide the back of this into between the top and bottom part of the cars seat.  Otherwise good, my car seat base doesnt seem as solid with this under it.
-1	We bought this at a different retailer and used it with our first baby's carseat. Despite installing the seat properly on top of the the protector pad (putting my knee in the carseat and tugging the LATCH straps very tightly), the carseat still slid around a LOT.We ended up removing the protector and reinstalling the carseat the same way (knee in seat, tugging hard), and the carseat didn't budge a bit.Our car has fabric, not leather seats, but the seats are contoured. I think because of the thickness of the pad, it doesn't conform to the shape of the seat, but becomes an additional surface, which can lead to a carseat sliding too much.We ended up getting something else, much cheaper, for the back of the seat, rather than something underneath the carseat, and that worked great. I think using a towel could work fine, underneath the carseat, for some protection, without sliding issues.
+1	I really like this seat protector for the infant car seat and base for the bench int he back of my 2005 Infiniti G sedan.  It really protects the leather seats from any indentations.  It is very durable and stiff, and for that I think it protects much better than the other seat covers that I have found in the stores.My only real issue with this product is that it does not seem to grip the bottom of the car seat base at all.  It seems to me that it should be a bit more rubbery rather than plasticky on the top to provide a gripping surface for the base.  I have sort of DIY remedied this by placing a non-skid pad between the seat protector and the base, but it does seem to be a defeating of the purpose, and a bit ugly as I have to be sure it stays in place, so it is a little bit larger than the base.  In hindsight, it could have worked as well to buy some non-skid strips to put on the base itself, but then it would be relying on some kind of adhesive to stay in place.It really is a shame that the company did not test this aspect of the seat base, as otherwise it would be hands down one of the best purchases as an accessory for my child.UPDATE:  10/2013I changed carseats, now I use the Chicco Nextfit, and this protector really is perfect.  I think the base of the Chicco is much grippier, and nothing slides anymore.  It must be something with the Graco bases that cause the sliding around.Disclaimer:  I LOVE THE CHICCO NEXTFIT - if you are looking for a convertible carseat, or toddle seat do yourself a favor and buy the Nextfit.  It is the best.
+1	I am so glad i bought this. I did not realize how bad car seats left marks on leather seats. This mat is perfect. I have never had any problem with it sliding and it matches the gray leather in my truck. In fact I bought two one for my 4 years old booster and one for my sons infant carseat. I must have.
+1	We brought this to the Toronto Police both times for our Graco Snugride 35 (infant carseat) and our Diono (used to be Sunshine Kids) big kid seat.  We had both of them installed with these seatsavers into a Nissan Altima and a Nissan Rogue SUV as we had two of each car seat.  All seatsavers took some time to properly secure as we have leather in both vehicles, but it was well worth it.  Kept our vehicles clean too.  They are extremely snug and if the Toronto Police approve, that's good enough for me
+1	I was told that carseats stretch out your leather if you don't place anything between them so we decided to try this saver and boy does it save. I have just small pressure points in the very back that you can see when you remove the carseat but they have gone away within a couple days. The bottom of this is a harder plastic the the others I have seen in stores which I think is what helps this. No complaints here and I would defiantly recommend to anyone. In fact I'm ordering one now for my mom's car as the little bit extra cost makes it well worth not having stretched out leather.
+1	Saved our leather seats, just wish the backing was a bit longer to allow for more height. Easy to remove, clean and captures all of the Cherrios, goop, and other crazy kids stuff without harming your seats.
-1	I bought this for my son's baby car seat because I would find him with his head bobbed to the side when I checked on him.  It looked very uncomfortable.  Hoping that this would solve the problem I bought this item. I have to say that it is a waste of money. There are no instructions in the package, thankfully it's easy to figure out. I installed it both as a single and also as a double and neither variation supported my sons head properly. I would still find him with his head bobbed to the side and looking uncomfortable. If I had the packaging I would return it.  I will try it as he gets a bit older and see if it works better.  I ended up using a rolled up receiving blanket and that worked much better.  Save your money. I would have given it zero stars but the lowest is one.
+1	After my first ride in the car with my son, I found him with his head in a very weird position due to lack of head control.  The poor thing looked so uncomfortable and I swear I thought the jiggling had snapped his little neck!  So I ran out and bought these head supporters.  I have to say, they were helpful.  I put the larger one in the swing and left the smaller one in the car seat.  They did seem to help control the head bobbing until he was old enough to hold up his own head.The cons:1.  the headrest does not really snap in to the seat anywhere, so basically you're just placing it in the seat (similar to what you'd do with a rolled up towel).2.  when we took our car seat to the police station to have it inspected, they didn't like the head rest placed in the car seat because it didn't fit securely (i.e. wasn't secured to the fabric) and because the seat had not been crash tested with the headrest in place.  The alternatives they recommended were either to contact the manuafacterer and buy a head rest that HAD been crash tested in our particular seat model, or to just use rolled up towels.  (I'm not sure what difference a towel would make in a crash, but I'm just repeating what they said)In the end, we disregarded what the police had recomended and just used the headrest until our son no longer needed them (which really wasn't all that long).  The product worked fine and luckily we didn't need to test out the whole crash test theory.Having said that, would I buy this again?  Probably not.  Like I said, the product worked well and I gave it 4 stars because we really didn't have any problems with it, but all things considered, why not just roll up a couple of towels?
+1	This is a must have when your baby is small. This one is better than the one that came with our infant car seat- its softer and it fits better.
+1	This bag is great!  I can carry it out in public and no one gives me that "EEEEWWW - a parent!" look.  Also, the changing mat is perfect (now that baby is bigger only her diaper fits on it, but also not too big to carry in bag).  It also has plenty of pockets for me to carry my stuff in it without a purse. Although the cell phone holder is way too big for my phone, I do use it to carry other items (formula packets, diaper ointment, favorite baby toys).  I love that there is a pocket built in for those clothes you had to change baby out of while out, and the interior mesh pockets are the perfect size for a small box of wipes and about 7 diapers.This is the best diaper bag!  The only thing it lacks to make it absolutely perfect is a smaller bag that is easily removable to carry when you "pop in" somewhere for a minute.
+1	Before I became a mom, I thought I needed a huge bag but it turns out, I don't (not sure why).  This bag has lots of pockets, is well-made and is stylish so I know many moms would love this.  For me it's a hassle and barely fits in the basket in my stroller.
+1	Was surprised at all the bad reviews.  Got this sound machine about 2 weeks after the baby came home and now 3 months later it's turned into a MUST have.  Just logged on to buy a second for the grandparents house since he will be over there more when I go back to work.
+1	This is good for the price. Its a decent white noise machine for a baby. My daughter has slept much better since we got it. I keep it on all night as well at during her naps. Satisfactory product. Might get one for my sons room.
+1	I like the option you have of keeping it on for more than an hour (all day if you'd like), but I wish it could be louder.
+1	It does what it says it's going to. We leave it on all night, on the rain setting. Not sure why people say it's not very loud, if you wanted it louder you could put it closer to the crib..?! You can get really creative with the sounds. It allows you to combine them which is unique.
+1	I wish I would have bought one of these for myself like 10 years ago.  We use it 3 times a day and I use it when I take a nap :)So many sound options and it's holding up nicely.
+1	My son was a very light sleeper and any little noise would wake him up. I bought this thinking that it wouldn't work but was worth a try. It actually did help him to stay asleep. He would sleep for hours at a time as long as the machine was on. It actually helped me to relax too bc we slept in the same room. I don't like things hanging on this crib so I liked that this machine can be put anywhere.I put it on the floor under his bassinet then on a short stool next to his crib. I haven't had to use it lately but I keep it close by just in case.
+1	I wouldn't quite describe this as a "must have" but ours does get its fair share of use.  As others have said its a plug-in or battery operated sound maker.  It plays womb sounds, rain, thunder etc.  We often turn it on at bedtime to drown out other household noises.  Plus, we notice our daughter seems to sleep better with music/white noise in the background.  My only criticism might be the volume.  Sometimes even when we have it up as loud as it will go certain sounds are barely audible unless you are right up on the machine.  If your infant is a fussy sleeper this product is worth a try.
+1	My wife and I bought the DEX Products Sound Sleeper  sound machine when we read inHealthy Sleep Habits, Happy Childthat this would help our new born sleep through the night. We have been using it for the last 6 months and we are very satisfied with its performance.It has several sound options, but we primarily use the "Rain" sound at maximum volume with the sound machine sitting on the floor next to our daughter's crib. This drowns out the small sounds that might wake her, while not activating our our voice activated baby monitor that sits waist high next to her crib.This sound machine also has a sleep timer, but we never use it.If you have a baby, you should really consider purchasing this sound machine.
-1	Overview:I bought one of these about a year ago and it's fine.  It included batteries and it really helped out when we needed to travel.  The current version is worse in many ways, and I do not recommend it.PROS:> It's a nice size, and easy to use.> It does what it says> It's fine if you have an outlet and your power never goes out.CONS:> The power cord is now PERMANENTLY attached and cannot be unplugged.> The battery compartment CANNOT BE USED.  That's right, YOU CANNOT USE BATTERIES WITH THIS UNIT.  If you want to travel, or if the power goes out, this machine is useless.  On the older version of this machine, if you unplug the power cord, the batteries can be used.  However, if the power goes out the batteries do NOT take over automatically.> This is noticeably quieter than our old version of this machine.  While the volume buttons both goes up the same number of times, our old sound machine feels like it has 2-3 louder levels.  This new machine stops getting loud at about half the volume of our old unit.  As a result, it is barely loud enough to drown out background noises in a house.> One oddity: There is a "demo" switch on the bottom, and when traveling it often gets hit, which causes this unit to turn off after a few minutes.  It's not a big deal, but it's a hassle.WOULD I BUY THIS AGAIN?> No, I would not recommend this item.----------------For what it's worth, the serial number on our old machine is 0409 and the new one is 1412.  Otherwise they appear identical.  I am disappointed that the new one falls short in so many ways.
+1	We bought this when our baby was just an infant since his room shares a wall with our tv room. It is extremely easy and intuitive to use. We mainly use it on the ocean setting which is plenty loud. I do not need to turn it up all the way to watch tv in the next room. It will also drown out the shower, the toilet (also next to his room), loading the dishwasher, and moderate talking. It will not drown out our dyson, the doorbell, or the dog barking. However, some of the other options are quieter (I.e. the heart beat and rain are much quieter). The ocean sound is very realistic and has much better sound quality than the competitors version at my mom's house. I like that I can leave it on all night or have it automatically turn off after an hour. We usually use it plugged in but have found the battery option invaluable for traveling. In fact, my husband and I like it so much for traveling we take it even without the baby! It drowns out all those weird noises in hotel rooms. Downsides for us, it doesn't really have as many options as they make it sound like- there are only like six main sounds and then extra sounds that go over the top of those sounds. But do you really want a random bell tolling or bird squawking to wake up baby?! Finally, we have used this three times a day (2 naps and bedtime) for two plus years without a single problem! We are buying a second one for the next kid!
+1	This was my one thing I wanted in a sound machine. I have bought the little lamb that has soothing sounds, but it only lasts 20 minutes or something like that. I didn't realize that when I bought it, we were wanting something that played the sound the whole time he slept to block out noises from outside and help him sleep.Great features:The sounds can be played sperately (rain, thunder, waves) or can be combined with other noises (rain and thunder).It can play for a short time or all night.Volume controls - can play very softly or loud enough to cover up noises of me cleaning while he sleeps.Has held up for going on one year so far with no problems! We play in every night and during every nap - he has slept 11 hours a night since he was 4 months old!
+1	We use this for all night sleep with our 4 month old. We used to have a sleep sheep but we needed to turn it on every time our baby stirred to help ease her back to sleep. We looked for an all night sleeping machine but all were so expensive. This one is great and inexpensive! For those reviews that say its not loud enough- I have a trick! When you first turn it on, it does not go to the volume level you left it at. It always goes to a mid level volume. So every night I turn it on and press the volume up button a few times to make it louder. Hope this helps people.
+1	We love this for background noise for our toddler to sleep with. He has had a ocean waves machine since the hospital where he was born, and I swear he sleeps better with it.  It has really helped us establish a great sleeping pattern with him, which means mom and dad sleep better.  I love that this one plugs in, our previous one worked on batteries which drove me nuts when they died in the wee morning hours and I would have to stumble in to replace them.  I only wish this had a better way to mount it on the wall out of playful fingers reach.
+1	I've been using the sound sleeper for a month now and it's great! I didn't purchase this item right when my DD was born because I figured it wasn't a necessary item. After fighting to get her to sleep during the day I didn't know what else to do. Then my husband and I were talking to each other next to her crib debating on how to get her to sleep (she was crying) and after about 5 minutes we realized that she had passed out! A light went off and I realized that all she needed was some background noise because the absolute silence was unnerving for her. To try out my theory I downloaded some rain music (I knew she fell asleep great when it was raining) to put on my iPod and it did the trick. I immediately remembered this being on our registry and purchased it right away. The sound sleeper has been playing ever since! We use the rain/thunder combination but our DD also likes the ocean/thunder too. There are definitely other combinations to choose from, but those work for us. The volume is great and has a great range from quiet to loud. We use ours on the continual on position but you can also put it to go off in 60minutes. I know people have trouble with their babies waking up after the sound goes off so we keep it permanently on and since the sound sleeper plugs in(!!!) you don't have to worry about eating up batteries. The sound sleeper is definitely a must have for out LO. So to recap:Pros:1. Volume is great going from quiet to loud.2. It doesn't interfere with us hearing our DD on the baby monitor.3. Lots of combinations to choose from.4. Choice of continual play or turning off after 60min.5. Plugs in so you don't have to worry about eating up batteries!Cons:1. If I have to list at least one, you can hear it on the baby monitor. It sounds like continual static. It doesn't bother me at all but it might be a down side to others.
-1	Bought an used Ipod touch instead.  Downloaded whitenoise app.  Worked better.  this was not loud enough.  Was not impressed at all.
+1	These sound sleeper is so durable.  This is my second one.  My sister gave me hers that she used with my nephew who is 9 now so it's over 9 years old and its still working awesome in my 2 yo sons room.  We've used it daily for the last two years on the same &#34;ocean&#34; setting.  We bought a second one from Amazon when my daughter was born in January.  We use it every night on the &#34;ocean&#34; setting as well and it works like a charm.  It puts my kids to sleep and my husband.  We are thinking about purchasing a third when we move my daughter to her room to have in our room since we love this little white noise maker.  The sound has numerous other sounds (rain, thunder, etc). We just like the sound of the ocean but I have put it on some of the other noises.  Also, it has a timer that comes in handy for nap time or so you don't forget to turn it on.
-1	I bought this before my daughter was born thinking that the "heartbeat" sound would be soothing for her.  I liked this better than the teddy bears with the heartbeat sound because it also had other soothing sounds that my husband and I might enjoy as well.I hated every sound it made.  The heartbeat was loud and annoying.  All the other "natural" sounds seemed very unnatural and mechanical.  My baby slept much better when I stopped using this.  If you want nature sounds, I suggest you invest something other than this product.We now use an old clock radio tuned to AM static and it works better than anything else.
+1	After many nights of not sleeping through the night or naps getting cut short due to outside noise I NEEDED this machine.  It works great!  My daughter starts rubbing her eyes once it's turned on.  It cuts down all of the other noises so that she sleeps longer and sounder.  I am so glad that I bought this to me it is worth WAY more than what I paid!
+1	We bought this right after we began putting my daughter to bed in her crib.  She had been sleeping in a bassinet that had a small music/sound box attached and had gotten used to falling asleep to the sound of waves or trickling water.  But then we started putting her in her crib...she tossed & turned and took awhile to fall asleep.  I think maybe it was just too quiet for her without the noises she had become accustomed to.  We bought the Sound Sleeper and it was like magic!  She falls asleep without any fussing.  There are alot of settings for different sounds and I like that it has a 1 hour timer feature.
+1	Everything good the reviews are saying is completely true!  But I noticed everyone was using them on young babies and I wanted mine for my two year old.  I was desperately trying to get her to fall asleep on her own with absolutely no luck.  She would never sleep in a crib even as a baby so at 1 we put her in a big girl bed.  Now that she is 2 we wanted her to fall asleep in it on her own around 7 p.m. and then stay asleep through the noise in the house.  We thought this was impossible since we have tried so many things.  The first night we got this, it worked like a charm. I put it own the sound it automatically starts on and turned it up as far as it would go and tucked my little one in and left the room.  It miraculously worked! We have been using it for a few weeks now and I can't believe I didn't try this sooner. So just know, it works with older children too! Happy sleeping!
-1	Even on maximum volume this machine is so quiet that it is completely useless.Ambient noise in the room completely drowned it out. I returned it immediately.
-1	I am actually really mad that I wasted money on this item. We have been running a CD player with rain sounds in our son's nursery for months now. We were getting worried that the CD player might just die, so we thought this white noise machine would do. I was worried about the volume when I ordered it, but other reviews made me think it would be loud enough. NOT TRUE. This thing won't block out ANY NOISE. The puny little speaker is just not big enough. We'll just buy another CD player I guess. The rain sound is also very disappointing and just sounds like crackling sounds. Extremely disappointed.
+1	After reading some neg comments abt this I wasn't sure what to expect but all I can say is - get it and you won't be sorry. Works great - DOES have plenty of volume contrary to some reports and is easy to use
+1	My husband and I just wanted a little backgroud noise for the times when one of us has to get ready while the other stills sleeps.  This product has been perfect for those occassions.  I do wish there were a specific "white noise" selection, but for the cost, this item is just right.  Some reviews indicated that it wasn't loud enough, but it is plenty loud for us.
+1	This is just fantastic. We previously were using the lulaby bear but the darn thing kept messing up. We went through three of them before finding this. Here is the break down:Good1. Can have it play all night or use the automatic shut off.2. Tons of sounds to choose from3. Small, fits in our playards little rack where we keep diapers and such. Also easy to pack when staying somewhere overnight.4. Has the option to plug in to save money instead of wasting batteries, but the battery option is nice to have two since you do not always have an outlet everywhere.5. Can program it to play one sound, play two sounds at the same time (such as rain w/ thunder), or you can choose the option for it to play sounds at random.6. Easy Easy Easy to use. I never even read the instruction manual.Bad:1. It does not go real real loud.To give an example of how loud it goes. If we turn it up to full volume and close the bedroom door we can hear it (it is on the far side of the room away from the door, our room is an average master bedroom) if there is not another sound going on. But if the T.V, dishwasher, dogs, or shower is running anywhere in the house we cannot hear it. That is more than enough for us, especially since it is right next to our babies crib and as long as he hears it we are happy. Also when we go to bed and all things are off in the house we have to turn it down to its lowest volume otherwise it is too loud. I hope that helps!!
+1	The description lists that the machine allows 2 sounds to be combined... only some sounds can be combined... you can combine most of the water sounds with bird sounds or other beeping type.  The thunder sound in good but the womb sound is more like a broken radio.  We've been using the machine with our 14 month old for the last few months and he sleeps longer when it is on and goes to sleep sooner.  My main issues with it are those described above and that it doesn't have a memory... when yo turn it off then back on it goes back to a default, not the combination of sounds and volume level you had it on last.
+1	I love these bottles. They don't leak like some other ones I've tried and they don't let any air in while baby is feeding. The only thing is you have to loosen the nipple at the end to see how much the baby has drank. Also there is not enough room on the liners to mix the formula inside the bottle. Other than that my son and I are very happy.
+1	These bottles are the BEST!  I am breastfeeding but due to medical issues, we had to give our baby a bottle from the beginning and she took this one with no problem.  She switches back and forth between bottle and nursing and is great!  This bottle system is SO easy to use.  It's easy to put a bottle together quickly and they transport well, so they're perfect for using on the go too.  I love them!  5 stars.
+1	I primarily breast feed and pump so my husband can bond with baby during feeding also. I originally got alot of Avent Bottles but baby didn't like the nipples.  The playtex nursers worked well with the Gerber Breast Milk Storage Bags as well as their own liners.  I did however have to buy the nurser nipples for newborns (square tip) which are softer and more 'natural' shaped.
+1	this system is working great, it  attaches to my pump and stores easily.  Its a great way for my husband help with feeding and the nipples it comes with helps avoid confusion.  I highly recomend it if your breast feedinf.
-1	At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week. It's not easy to squeeze the air out. Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up! Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out. I'm sorry I ever bought them.
+1	I breastfed and formula fed my baby for the first 5 weeks. My baby did not fuss at all when I offered her these type of nipples (compared to the breast).  I also tried the Dr. Brown's, Gerber and Evenflo and she did not like them at all.  I think because the base of the nipple was not as big as the Playtex nipples.  Anyhow, it is very convenient for at home use.  It is not convenient when you are out and about.  You still need to have some type of regular bottle.  I found that out the hard way.  Something in my diaper bag punctured the plastic liner and the formula got all over my brand new diaper bag.  I suggest the Playtex ventair system for a regular bottle because it has the same basic nipple shape. Overall I think Playtex has the best bottles and nipples.
+1	I love this system because it's so easy. Rather that washing the bottle you can just change the liner and wash the nipple. I use store brand non-drop-ins because theyre cheaper and the regular "bag" liner colapses easier.I agree with other reveiwers, the slow flow nipples that come with the bottle are worthless. My 1 month old gets frusterated that nothing is coming out. We tried the tri-cut and again he got frusterated so i ripped the cut a little bigger and that works so I went and got the fast flow.
+1	I adore this system.  My son only gets breastmilk, and the system works great for bottling/storing/serving breastmilk.  In conjunction with the breast milk storage kit, I am able to express milk directly into a bottle.  I then twist on a lid and put it in the freezer or fridge.  When the milk freezes solid, I am able to remove the liner and lid from the bottle.  This takes less freezer space and means I don't have to buy that many actual bottles.I will have to keep buying liners, of course.  But the cost isn't prohibitive.  And I did have to buy several storage systems, but compared to paying for formula, I find this cost unimportant.  Particularly because I will be able to use the system again for our next child.It is a tidy, easy system that works great for me and for my son.  He has no problem taking the silicone nipple in spite of the fact that he prefers the breast.  He IS slower about taking the bottle, but he takes it fine nonetheless.
+1	Easy to use, clean, store, warm quickly, and travel with.  The nipples come in slow or fast and are so much like the breast my daughter went back and forth without a problem.  the darker nipples are a little more pliable and my daughter much preferred them over the clear ones.  works with generic pre-formed bottle liners from target, wal-greeens, and wal-mart.  good investment
+1	My baby was breast fed for the first 2 months. We used a nipple shield by Medela but as she got older the nipple shield was just not cutting it when it came to my baby being full. I decided to pump but when my baby was fussy I couldn't pump every 3-4 hours like I needed to so my supply dropped. I didn't buy this starter set, I bought a few 4 ounce bottles and gave my baby what milk I had pumped and formula. I have now bought the 8 ounce bottles and use them also. These bottles are great. My baby burps right away and is never gassy. With breast feeding she hardly ever burped. We use the drop in liners and have had NO problems with leaks. I also heat her formula up by putting hot water in a cup, putting the formula in a liner and dropping the liner into the warm water. Then I mixed it up with a spoon to make sure there are no cold spots, test it and put the liner into the bottle and feed my baby. You also don't have to worry about water dripping off the liner and getting on baby because of the plastic they are made of, the water does not stick to the liner. When I pull the liner out you can't even tell it has been sitting in water.(...)
-1	After breastfeeding my son, I decided to use the Playtex Nursers for bottlefeeding.  I thought the bags would be convenient and make clean up easy, plus the bottles are supposed to be like the breast right?  Well, my son got a lot of air with these bottles and did not like the nipples.  Also, I tried both the Playtex bags and Wal-mart brand.  The rim of the Playtex liners is very thin and I had several leaks because the liner shifted as I squeezed the air from it. I tried the Wal-mart brand, which has a sturdier liner rim and did not leak.  However, these cheaper liners are smaller!  If you compare them with the Playtex (both the 4 oz and 8 oz), the Wal-mart liners are smaller in circumference and will not hold as much.  I absolutely could not get the 4 oz liners to hold 4 oz or the 8 oz liners to hold 8 oz.Also, if you need to sit the bottle down for a minute, the air comes right back in the liner and you have to squeeze it out again before you can resume feeding.  I thought these bottles were a lot of trouble and aggravation.  I would rather scrub regular bottles.
+1	Baby is breast-fed and I registered for Avent bottles on a friend's recommendation. I wanted to be able to pump and enable my husband to feed her at night. Our baby hated the Avent bottle and wouldn't take the nipple. We found the nipples on the Avent too long and hard and made baby gag when she attempted to latch on. We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle. The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter. Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem. I'm so glad we tried out these bottles.  Saved us a lot of time and stress on the baby!
+1	My son used to have such bad gas, he'd scream for hours.  We'd have to give him Mylicon drops every two hours to keep him happy.  When we switched from a normal bottle to the Playtex Nurser system, we had no more problems.  He's happier, we're happier... These are the best bottles out there!
+1	These bottles are the best for switching between bottle and breast.  My daughter hardly ever has to take a bottle, but when she does, she has no problem with these.  She would try to inhale smaller nipples because they didn't have the broad base like the breast does, and like these playtex nipples do.  Plus, Playtex now has a storage system for pumping into the liners.  This set comes with an adapter to connect to the pump and some caps.  You can also buy more caps.  They make it so easy to store milk and then just pop it on the bottle.  The adapter definitely works with the Medela pumps. I think it will work with all except maybe Avent.
+1	I bought a few different kinds of bottles while I was pregnant since I planned on breast and bottle feeding.  My son never had an issue with nipple confusion - he would take breast, bottle, pacifier of any sort... However he would not take any other type of bottle.  I continued to try other bottles fearing finding myself out with the bottle and no liners.  In seven months, I have not been able to find another type of bottle that my son will take.I also cannot believe how easy it is to warm the formula (or breast milk) in the liners as opposed to another bottle.  All we need to do is fill the liner and place it in a cup of warm tap water for about three to five minutes.  It's wonderful!If they stop making these when I have another, I don't know what I'll do.  They are just the best!
+1	I'm a nurse, so I'm extra picky about health care products.  This is my choice for my two girls.  It's fast.  It has a ridge to indicate how far in to insert the thermometer rectally.  It's backlit so you can read it in a dimly lit room.  And it's accurate.
+1	Makes it very easy to take temperatures rectally which is the most accurate way! Love how it folds and is always accurate.
+1	Buy with confidence. This is a great item to have for you diaper bag and at home when those moments of sickness arise.
+1	I've unfortunatly had to use this recently for the 1st time. It's so easy to use!! I've always been scared to use a thermometer rectally but I wasn't nervous with this one at all. The reading was very quick and easy to read. It saves your last reading so you dont have to try and remember what it was last time to know if your baby's temp is better or worse.  It also has a backlight on the screen so you can use it in the dark, which is nice if the child/baby is sleeping and you dont want to turn the light on and wake him/her up to take their temp.And I LOVE the way to folds up inside itself so you dont worry about loosing the cap or cover, which I always do.This is a quality thermometer and especially for the price!! So easy to use and much more accurate than the ear thermometers (dont EVER buy one of those, theyre a complete waste of money and dangerous to your baby by being so inaccurate!!)
+1	I'm so grateful for several features on this thermometer: the small line on the tip that shows you how far to insert it, the flexible end, the light up display and the FAST reading. Taking a rectal temp on a squirmy baby is no walk in the park, and even 4 seconds can feel like a lifetime! The fold up feature is actually quite handy - it's not much more "compact" than the unfolded thermometer, but when your baby gets his hands on the thing you've been sticking up his butt, you'll be sure glad the "business" end is tucked away (even if you do sanitize it every time - moms, you know what I mean)!As for accuracy, I have no complaints. Every parent has to learn what he/she is comfortable with regarding their child's health. I've never had a time when the thermometer has seemed off enough to bother me.
-1	We ended up chucking this last week and i wanted to be sure to warn others.  It was all over the map thermomoter wise.  It would say 100 when we thought she was slightly hot, so we'd get out hte 'freebie' from the hospital and it' would then say 98.4.  Oh, since we were nervous we'd then get out another one and do the same thing and it would then say right around hte 98.4.  Unfortuantely, this was not the first time it had done this to us. Save your money!  We invested in the ear thermometer scan hospital grade from braun.  holy goodness. piece of mind.  it's worth the 50!!  you figure you'll need one thermometer per kid with this type, the ear one is for hte whole family.  Yeah, I'm sorry I spent the 12 originally and tried to cheap out because this caused way to much worry.
+1	THIS THERMOMETER IS QUICK AND ACCURATE.  IT IS A GREAT DEAL FOR THE MONEY.
+1	I received this for a baby shower and I love it. It works fast so my baby doesn't get upset. I even went back and bought another one to keep in the diaper bag.
+1	I purchased this to replace my 1st 8 second thermometer that finally died after 4 years of use.  I find that it's accurate enough to know if my daughters have a fever.  If I'm really concerned I use a more accurate (and longer to work) thermometer to get exactly what the temp it.  The 8 seconds is just long enough to pin down the kid before they start screaming. :)I use it in the arm pit (and add .9 degrees) which is even better.
+1	I use the single pump exclusively to bottle feed my 10 month old son because of latching on problems.  This pump is fast and does not hurt once you get use to it.  I can pump MORE than 8 ounces in about 15 minutes, which allows me to only pump about 4 times in a 24 hour period.  This works great now that my son sleeps through the night, so I do not even have to get up to pump.This pump does take two hands if your breasts are heavy with milk because the plastic shield will need to be held firmly in place to allow the best suction.  The unit is much quieter if you use the cover or place a pillow over the top. I've never used any other pump, and the pricier ones may work better, but for the money I will recommend this pump first!
-1	I bought this pump months before my son was born because I could not afford to pay almost $300 for the Medella. I had a manual Medella pump when my daughter was born and did not want to go manual again.When I returned home from giving birth to my son, he stopped latching on well, so I pulled out my new electric pump and went to work. It was great. I could adjust the suction, and my breasts were healing from my son's poor nursing. I was even getting out 5-6oz of milk from each breast. The whole process took about 20-30 minutes.After 2 months of constant use, 4 times a day, one day last week the suction would not work. The motor was running but no suction. I took all the washable parts off again and put them back on 6 times, before it started working again. But then it also pulled some milk down the hose, luckly it did not go into the motor.Now when I use it, the suction is not as strong or as efficient. It now takes an hour or more to pump the same amount of milk I had been getting. And it still doesn't have anough suction to completly empty my breasts. When I finish pumping I have to express the remaining milk maually.I am going to call the company, I really hope they make this right.
+1	I had originally chosen another bedding set because it looked so cute on-line.  If you have a Babies R US near you, I recommend checking out the sets in person.  This one is truly outstanding and so much more attractive than the set I had liked before.  The pattern is soothing and classy, with muted blues and yellows.  There are several different materials on the quilt, which adds texture.  Although quilts are not recommended in cribs, I throw mine over a rocker and it is a really nice addition to the baby's room.The item I did not use is the valance.  I personally found it a little busy and there was only one, when I have 2 windows in my baby's room.  Everything else in the set was used and I even bought an additional matching blanket.This set is wonderful for a boy or a girl.  I knew I was having a boy and chose to go with this design since it will probably only be a couple of years before he will be asking for a room with the latest superhero or sports theme.  Very sweet for a baby.
+1	Nice design. Goes well with everything ( except bright red ). There are more cool additions for it in your local baby's r us.If the sheet they included was 100% cotton, it would have been 5 stars.
+1	I bought this for my baby boy 4 years ago and the blanket/fitted sheet still look like new, even after all the washings. I loved the colors and patterns, it's what attracted me to this bedding set. It's so adorable..I'm expecting a little girl now and if they had this in pink I would so get it for my baby girl, but sadly they don't! Very good quality even after 4 years! =)
+1	I decorated my daughter's room in Koala Baby sun/moon/stars theme but didn't like the mobile that came with it.  So I chose this one.  It has a very quiet motor and the lullaby is great. It took about 15 minutes to assemble (canopy is hardest b/c of small openings).
-1	After reading the negative reviews of this mobile (and seeing its "flimsiness" for myself at a local Babis R Us store), I went in search of other mobiles with a moon/stars motif.  I found several, but the cutest one by far is the one that matches the Lambs & Ivy "Twinkle Twinkle" bedding set.  It has a white moon and many blue and yellow stars...[...]Hopefully other people will be able to take advantage of this -- I'm not sure how long it will be offered at this price, but good luck!  I was so excited when I found it!
+1	Friend loved this item! We bought it off their registry as a gift, they love it.
-1	I had this pump with my first baby born 2 years ago. I thought that it would be a better deal than Avent and boy was I wrong. I got it home and cleaned it and started using it and it made my already sore breasts hurt even more (cracking and bleeding) and made my problems even worse. The first time I used it came apart during use. And the 5 times I used it after that too. I called customer service and the lady was extremely rude to me, interupting me while I was trying to explain my problem to her and all she did was explain how to put it back together. I took it to my lactation consultant and she said that she hates that brand/model and that she had 5 other mothers have the same complaints about it. The store I bought it from has since stopped stocking this model. Yeah it has a design similar to Avent but trust me there is a reason why this product only costs $20 its junk. The breast funnel is hard plastic and very uncomfortable might as well use a kitchen funnel, This time I went with a hospital grade pump Playtex Embrace and I love it
-1	First of all, we had to use a pipe wrench to get the thing unscrewed... it was so tight neither dh or I could get it to budge and even w/ the pipe wrench it was a challenge... Then, there was no way I could get the arrow to line up w/ the square, unless I used the pipe wrench... hmmm... not sure I want to carry a pipe wrench around with me when I need to pump...  Oh, and the suction is horrible.  I have the Avent Isis but wanted something I could pump directly into the Soothie bottles, stupid choice... the Avent is about 10,000 times better, even with more parts to clean, well worth the time and money...  With the Avent Isis I can pump 6-10 oz in 5 minutes... this one I was lucky to get an ounce in 5 minutes, don't waste your money.
-1	I was breastfeeding my son when just a few days after birth the nurses gave him a bottle against my wishes. He never latched on again after that. I still wanted to feed him breast milk but naively thought I could buy just any pump. I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a pump but I should have. This pump was terribly uncomfortable ( I can't compare with other pumps because I never used any others). I never had discomfort breastfeeding but this pump made me cringe every time I used it. The suction was poor and my milk supply actually decreased the longer I used this pump. If you're going to pump, spend the money on a good one.
+1	My son has been wearing SleepSacks since he was about 4mths and they are a great way to keep your child sleeping safely in their own room without having to worry if they are too cold.
+1	I love this product. I have used it since he was 6 months. I wish the would do an early waker sleepsack in cotton.
+1	My guy love's his sleepsacks. I was excited to find that they make bigger sizes so my man can keep using these. The fabric is so soft on this one. I really like the subtle design and unique color.
+1	We have been using Halo's since our son was born. He is 15 months old and we plan on using them at least until he is 2.
+1	A must have for my daughter after we broke her of a swaddle.  Gives me peace of mind that she is warm.
+1	This is great for spring/summer. Not having the arms works for me because I do not want baby to get over heated. I just use a long sleeve PJ. I like that it zips up from top to bottom which helps with diaper changes.
+1	it's nice and warm. because of the location of the zipper, you don't need to take off the blanket when changing diapers.
+1	I am not paranoid by any means about crib suffocation.  My seven month old does occasionally go to bed with a teddy bear (he insists upon having something to cuddle) and we keep his limbs out of the crib slats by way of a breathable bumper.  But it is nice to be able to keep him warm without putting a blanket in the crib, as a blanket that could get around his face does give pause.  In the sleep sack he can kick his legs to his heart's content, and the sack is loose enough that he's worn it once in his car seat on a particularly cold night.  The sack is roomy enough that we could secure the car seat straps between his legs without problem.  It was safer than putting him in his seat wearing his fluffy down coat, and kept him warm.  We use this thing every night.
+1	We received a sleepsack as a gift at a baby shower and ended up ordering another one in a larger size once our son outgrew the newborn size.  We spent a lot of money before our baby was born on swaddling products and in the end, found that we preferred the sleep sack to all of the other products and wish we would have gotten more of these.  The sleepsack is great for our son because he likes to sleep with his arms free.  We can just put him in the sleep sack and not have to worry about tucking a blanket around him (which can often wake him up if we move him once he's already sleeping). We use this product almost every night and during the day for naps (so I would suggest getting a couple if you can!) The sleepsack is easy to put on/take off and the zipper allows for easy access for diaper changes. The fabric is particularly nice because it's not as hot as the fleece version of this product.This product is a total lifesaver...we highly recommend this product!
+1	I have several of these halo sleep sacks in 100% cotton. They are great - except that the fabrics are not all the same weight depending on the color you buy. Soft pink is nice and heavy as is the one that is sweet pea green (sold on another amazon listing) . The pink stripes with the bird is thinner (also on another listing) . It is still a bit heavier than the one Summer infant sleep sack I have (pink butterfly's) . The differing fabric weights are why I knock off a star. Of course fleece would be warmer but you expect that when buying fleece. I thought all the 100% cotton would be the same weight (warmth) but they are not. I will stick to the solid colors since I also have a solid halo swaddle that is heavy fabric.
+1	My baby loves her sleepsacks almost as much as I do.  They are wonderful because you don't have to worry about the blanket falling off or accidentally covering the baby's face.  The cotton ones are perfect for summer because it is light and airy.  My baby knows it is bedtime when we pull out her sleepsack and settles right to bed (typically).  They are pretty long, so they fit for a long time.
+1	We've been addicted to Halo SleepSacks since my daughter was a newborn. We've been through all of them - the swaddles when she was a newborn, micro fleece in the winter, and cotton in the spring/summer. Right now, she's a petite 2 yo (approx. 10th percentile in weight and 40th in height), and she *just* outgrew the size large, which she was in since she was a little over a year old. Note that even though they say Large fits 22-28 LBS, my daughter outgrew it by length when she was only 23 LBS. The XL is perfect on her right now.We keep her room at 70 degrees and she wears a short sleeve onesie, fleece zip-up footed pajamas, and this cotton sleep sack to bed. She's just the right temperature and sleeps soundly through the night!
+1	We have been using Halo sleep sacks for my son for a while now and we needed to upgrade to an XL because he is getting over 25 lbs now and 30 inches at 18 months.  His Large size sack fits him still but he kicks the end of it like it's getting too short.  Fleece is too warm for him and no one had any cute patterns in plain cotton so I ordered the puppy one on Amazon.  When we got it in the mail we thought it was way too huge but then after it came out of the wash it looked perfect.  Then we went to put it on him and it's only about an inch longer than his old sack!  I put the old one on top of this one and they look practically the same but there is maybe an inch if that more in length on this XL sack.  I am disappointed because I was hoping it would last him a while and be more comfortable for him but it looks like it is the same as his old one.  I don't know what we will do after he grows out of this because the next size up has foot holes and we don't want those because our son is a climber.  I like these sacks because they discourage climbing and keep him warm at night because he never keeps his blanky on.  Anyway, so this is a cute sack but beware when washing.  We used cold wash and delicate dry but it still shrank too much.
+1	We have these in many different sizes and have used them through all of the stages of growing.  We have been very happy with them and they work quite well in the stages where you shouldn't use blankets.  They also can't kick these off!
+1	This baby cack is very good quality. It has been washed several times already and is in excellent shape. It is very soft on baby's skin and we are ready to order the next size. It came well wrapped and packaged.
+1	No more kicking off socks, covers or blankets. I love that i know he is sleeping warm and cozy bundled up in his wearable blanket.
+1	i was worried about my son smothering himself with his blanket since he kept pulling them over his face while he slept. The sleep sac has been great. I put him to sleep with a long sleeve onesie on and thats enough to keep him warm. It also keeps his legs from going crazy at night, which usually startles the poor boy and wakes him up.
+1	We have been huge fans of Halo products from the start. We used the swaddled all the time for our daughter for the first few months. We even had an issue with one of the swaddles and my husband emailed the Halo company about it and received a response from the FOUNDER of the company who seemed genuinely appreciative of our feedback.For that reason, we have stuck with this brand and have been using the wearable blankets as she has grown. She currently wears a fleece one to bed every night and will wear these cotton ones during the spring.  These are wonderful products made by a great company who stands behind them.
+1	Great for keeping his legs out of the crib slats for the most part (he somehow still manages, but this keeps them from going up past his knees I think).  Helps us all get more sleep.
+1	My son loves a sleepsack, but some of them are so heavy.  This one is so cute and is super light.  I'm a big fan.  It's the favorite.
+1	Super cute and soft. I am still pregnant but I am excited to use this for my LO. It get's a little chilly at night and these seems cozy enough to keep her warm.
+1	This cotton sleep sack has been perfect during nights when it is too warm for our fleece sleep sack. Part of our routine at night is a bath and then putting on pj's and a sleep sack so I was glad to find this lighter one so we could continue our routine. My son is 10 months and around 20 pounds and the large size is nice and comfy for him. He has lots of room but doesn't get tangled in it and can stand when he wakes up (which he always does when he wakes up and calls out for me). The light blue color and cute dog pattern is adorable also. I would recommend this sleep sack as a great alternative to blankets (which we never use because of SIDS and the fact that he moves around so much I don't think a blanket would stay put anyways!).
+1	I bought about 4 small size and 5 medium and my son wears them every night to bed.  I stuck with the cotton so he wouldn't get overheated.  LIFE SAVER!  When I first brought my son home, I couldn't bear to put him down in his bed to sleep because I was so worried about SIDS and that he would fling his blanket over his head.  From day one he didn't like to be swaddled and would punch out of his blanket (he was a big baby...9 lb 5 oz).  I remember literally staying awake all night in the beginning just holding him as he slept/nursed.  Finally started using these and I could sleep without peeking over the edge of the bed all night!!
+1	My daughter transitioned from swaddling into sleeping in a sleep sack. The ones we had were fleece from Carters and had sleeves. I wanted to get the same thing in a larger size, but no other sleep sacks had sleeves (and were reasonably priced). I bought the Halo SleepSack based on the good reviews, and I like them a lot. I was worried about them not having sleeves, but it hasn't been a problem. Since these are 100% cotton, they did shrink a little, but I bought a size larger in case of shrinkage and so it would last longer.The only complaint I have is that the zippers are upside down. They are designed that way, and I can see the appeal for night time diaper changes, but it makes it difficult to zip when my daughter moves around a lot.
+1	These are so awesome. I plan on buying a lot more! This version is more light weight. Which I like because I don't keep my house too cold and until summer comes I am putting him in a light weight sleeper. my 4 month old didn't care too much for it the first couple days but then got used to it and sleeps in one most nights. I do not care for the heavier weight ones, not sure if its micorfleece or just fleece either way I'm not planning on buying any of those.
+1	Love their products.  Our son's been in halo sleepsacks since he was 1 month old.  Back then he used the swaddlers, then transitioned over at about 4 months to a newborn sleep sack, then to a small.  And now we're onto the medium sizes.  Crazy how they grow.This is a really cute print.  I love the light turqoise-ish color with cute little owls on it.  This sleep sack has served us well.  Durable, breathable and best of all, safe.  I think my son's so used to having a sleep sack on, I don't know what he'll do when we eventually switch to a blanket!We however, live in CA and get 100+ degree weather here during the summers and I just wish that halo also makes a thinner muslin version of this sleep sack for the really hot weather places.  Make a muslin version to compete with aden and anis please!
+1	This is perfect as an extra blanket ...easy to get on and to change a diaper in the middle of the night...he has plenty of room to wiggle around in it...recommend this for babies to have a safe blanket to use...plus its made of soft fabric
+1	Sleep sacks are perfect if your child is prone to getting their legs stuck in between the slats of the crib. With a sleepsack wearable blanket, their legs can't get stuck, and you don't need to use bumper pads, which are full of contriversy with SIDS. Also, you don't need to put your child in the crib with a loose blanket, which also contributes to SIDS.
+1	Our newborn is a very active kid, and no matter how tightly we cover him with blankets he manages to quickly "free" himself from those. In that regard this wearable blanket is a godsend. It has helped keep our boy warm and secure, and it has no chance of getting crumpled up and becoming potentially dangerous. It adds and extra step to our diaper changing routine, though, but that's a small price to pay for the peace of mind we have when getting him to wear this blanket. The cotton material feels soft, and it was easy to wash. Overall, we are very happy with this product and would recommend it to other parents of the newborns.
+1	This sleep sack is thin. It's great when it's warm out but not so much when it's freezing. If you live in colder climates, I highly recommend the Gro sleep sack. They're thick and made of comforter-like materials. They're so soft and warm, plus they come in adorable patterns.
+1	My daughter has a rotation of these Sleep Sacks. I wish these were a little tighter around the neck and arms, but it seems pretty comfortable for her. I especially like the pattern of this one. The animals are cute and work for a boy or a girl. She's on the tall side for eight months, so she is about to max out the length of the medium. I've tried theaden + anais 4 Pack Muslin Swaddle Wrap, Jungle Jamand the Merino Kids Baby Sleep Bag, 0-2 years, Oatmeal. Both are more generously sized and seemed a little too heavy for summer, but I'll probably use them again for fall and winter. The Merino Kids bag has some interesting features like adjustable snaps under the arms to make it tighter and a slot so you can run a car seat harness through it if need be. But, for the price, it should be special. The Halo Innovations Sleepsack is a much more affordable option and a great weight for summer.
+1	I love the Halo sleep sacks because they're safe, they allow my son to move around, and they keep him warm. We used the sleep sack swaddle from day 1, and now that he's rolling over we don't swaddle him with arms in. I bought this one so we could have one without the velcro straps for the swaddle, and I like that it's cotton so we will be able to use it in the summer without him getting overheated.
-1	I love halo sleep sacks, our twin boys still wear them every night at 16 months. Unfortunately one of he sleep sacks we received has a small defect at the top of the zipper making it a huge pain to zip up every night while wrestling a squirmy baby. We needed them ASAP so we just kept it, but still annoying every night trying to zip it up. Normally these sleep sacks are wonderful, we just got a dud. I recommend Theseus anyone, just make sure your zipper works!
+1	The SleepSack does what I need it to do:  keep my daughter warm as she sleeps.  She tends to move a lot while sleeping at night throwing off blankets in the process, and we bought this to make sure she stayed covered.  It was thinner than I anticipated, but it still does the job.The zipper is well-designed too, zipping from top down (or unzipping from bottom up).  This allows you to change diapers quickly while the SleepSack stays on the baby.This does what I need it to do; I'm glad to have bought it.
+1	The size chart on Halo's website seems to be accurate to this product.  We got the large even though she is just now 6 months old.  She is nearly 30" in length and probably a little more than 20 lbs.  It's a bit big even with a wash a dry, but I don't feel there is a danger of her head or arms coming out of the holes.  And she's getting bigger at such a fast rate she'll probably outgrow it in another few months.  Not sure how warm it'll be in winter, but I can always put her in thicker pyjamas.  She loves cotton and hates fleece which is why we went with this sack.  We haven't swaddled her since she was 1 week old, it's actually better not to swaddle, so we went for the arms free sack.  Love the color, good for a boy as well.I definitely sleep better knowing she's not going to smother herself especially since she's now a pro at rolling over to her tummy.
+1	Our baby was swaddled for sleep up until she was 6-months-old and started rolling over onto her stomach while swaddled.  We tried putting her in footie pajamas for sleep, but she seemed a bit restless during the night.  It was too drastic of a change from the swaddle she'd become comfortable with.  We tried this Halo SleepSack (on top of the pajamas), and she settled right down to sleep.  The SleepSack gives her the cosy comfort of a swaddle with the freedom to roll over without any safety issues.  Now we use a SleepSack every night.  We prefer the standard fabric (rather than the fleece variety).  Living in Houston, the Halo fleece fabric is too heavy and warm, even in winter.This particular design of dots is not our favorite Halo design, but it works just the same as the cuter designs.
+1	We love this wearable blanket so much that we bought every kind. They are wonderful. First I must say that they, obviously, do not confine the arms, so if your baby still gets startled by her jerky arm movements when trying to fall asleep he/she may not be ready for this yet. I am slowly making the transition from the Miracle Blanket over to this. My baby still needs the extra swaddling at night and when she is fussy, but she likes the freedom during her naps that this provides and likes to get at her fingers too.I did not find that my cotton sleep sack shrank. The zipper doesn't lay exactly flat on her, but I haven't found this a problem at all.I do feel the sizes run a bit small. My baby is wearing the small size and at 23" has just about outgrown it. I'd recommend getting them one size above what you think you need.I don't like that there are no arm sleeves at all. I really would have liked the choice of putting her in one with or without sleeves.This cotton is so nice and light (I wonder if the other reviewer was reviewing a fleece, flannel or quilted one instead) that I can't imagine it being any lighter without being to fragle to hold together.I very much like that the zipper is "upside down". It undoes from the bottom which means you don't have to completely unzip your baby for diaper changes and the zipper tab doesn't poke into the baby's chin.
+1	This is a great thing to have.  My baby twists and turns all over the place and would normally get all caught up in the blanket or kick it off while she sleeps.  Not only is this SIDS approved, but it solves kicking the blanket off (getting cold) and solves getting caught up in a tangled blanket.  I would very much recommend this.
+1	Its great, works just as expected, I do think Halo could make sure with sleeves, or removable sleeves. Otherwise, I have piece of mind knowing that baby's head won't get covered up by a blanket.
+1	I love the Halo sleepsacks. I own a few brands, and I find myself reaching around the other brands in the drawer to pull out a halo sleepsack. The material is soft and there's plenty of room for my son to move around in the sleepsack without feeling restricted which is good because he loves to move around the crib in his sleep!
+1	Very wonderful blanket! Works like a charm at letting baby know that it's time to go sleepies (whether it's naptime or bedtime). I've used this for a while now, since we stopped swaddling. It may soon be time to go up a size too.
+1	Child refuses to keep a blanket on. They are great on my now 16 month old who has figured how to take her pants (and occasionally diaper) off, but has not figure out the upside down zipper!
+1	My 10 months old baby has now been using this one every night for the past 2 months, and probably still will for a while :)Very practical, it still allows her to roll over and sit easily in her crib. We live in Florida so even though we have the A/C we just needed a light blanket and we loved the HALO swaddle bags but needed something bigger.We bought a cute one at IKEA that did not last long (the zipper broke), very disappointing, so got back with HALO. Do not regret it at all. Cotton is very soft of great quality even after weekly wash/dry. Zipper is still fully functioning. Like new after 2+ months!
+1	it's larger than i expected but i will keep it until my son can fit into it. my son is 25 lbs and around 28 inches, which is why i bought the Large based on the weight recommendation, but even the Medium is quite large on him right now. would suggest using the height recommendation as a closer indicator of what size to buy rather than weight.
+1	These are great, we actually have them in a couple different sizes so my son can grow into them.  (NOTE: We got him the blue one, but they make you review them separately)Here's what I love:1. Our house gets chilly at night, and even with a little space heater in his room, I worried about him being cold with no blankets! The sleep sack is snuggly and warm.2. Our son moves constantly, awake or asleep. Any blanket you did use (even if it were safe) would never stay on him. The sleep sacks have never tangled or bunched up under him.3. This is silly, but it just looks so darling. I love to see him all ready for bed, in his PJs and sleep sack.Our son HATED the sleepers that were sacks at the bottom, I think they felt restrictive because he would kick and kick at them and cry. He has never minded the sleep sack, maybe having his PJs on under it helps him feel more comfy.I recommend this, and recommend getting a couple in each size so that you can throw one in the wash and have another ready.
+1	These are great for little ones, Once my daughter got a little older she became attached to her blanket and had to sleep with it, by that time she could roll over, etc. so we weren't as worried about her sleeping with it.  When she got older she didn't want her feet confined, but when she was little, these were great for cold winters.
+1	I love these! These are the safest way to keep your baby warm, without having the risk of loose blankets in the crib.  These work great, are well made, hold up to many washes, and even open at the bottom for easier diaper changes.  I own several of these in different sizes for my little one and definitely recommend them.  I also like how the material is breathable cotton so that they keep my baby warm without the risk of overheating.  I also like how they come in neutral colors so that they will be able to be used by any future kids as well.  I would definitely recommend buying several of these.
+1	We have been using HALO SleepSacks for the last 7 1/2 months.  I love that I can give my baby a &#34;blanket&#34; without worrying that he will put it over his head and suffocate - I AM A WORRIER.  We started with the Newborn size with the optional swaddle.  My baby hated to be swaddled so we never used that function and rather just wrapped it around his belly (see directions).  We then went to the Small size and that also had the swaddle flaps.  So now that we are in the Medium size it is a little different to get used to it being free to move around (as opposed to having almost a thick belt that held the bulk down).  My baby is much more wiggly now so this gets wrapped around him in awkward ways (around a foot, or somehow twisted one way at the top and another at the bottom).  I do however love this product because I know my baby will be warm and not in danger from a blanket.  Additionally, the cotton material is light weight and has become useful when it is chilly but not cold.  I have also found that the sizing is fairly accurate.I would recommend this product to any new parent!
+1	This item is light-weight but still washes well.  I can't imagine using it outside of the summer months, because it is really just T shirt material but it is perfect for a little extra warmth in the middle of the night.
+1	I am so happy with this purchase! This sleepy bag is so good! I use it everyday now that the summer started!my baby is 8months I bought this bag size 24 months and it's perfect! Enough room to grow! I highly recommend it!
+1	I've been using sleepsacks on my daughter since she was born. She's now two years old and still sleeps with one! I love it because I can rest easy knowing she's always covered. It's also awesome because when your kid is wearing one of these, they can't reach their pants/diaper and take them off! I have so many friends who complain that their kid is constantly taking off their diapers during the naps and I don't have that problem! The zipper is at the bottom of the sack, so she doesn't know how to unzip it (she's two and STILL hasn't figured it out!) I love these and I will use them with all my kids!
+1	Love the halo sleep sacks. This fits my almost 6 monther. I like the cotton ones because my apt is always warm
+1	These are really great if your kid kicks off the blankets, then wakes up because he's cold. They are roomy enough for them to move around in, and sized generously. My son outgrew the small size by 6 months (29&#34;), and I skipped the medium size entirely and went right to a large, which he will be in for several more months.
+1	Snuggly soft, gives me peace of mind that she stays covered all night.  We've used this brand of sack since she got out of the arm-wrap swaddle type, and it was now time for the next size up.  It's as awesome as I expected.
+1	My son is 4-months old and the sleepsacks I had were all way too thick and warm for the summer. This cotton sleepsack is think, breathable and soft for him to wear in the summer to bed and for naps.
+1	This is the best sleepsack out there. It's reasonably priced and it works great for us. So far we own 6 Halo sleepsacks in different sizes, and if I were to buy more, they'd definitely be the same brand.
+1	Sleepsacks are great. My newborn goes through phases of not wanting to be swaddled. This fit her well at 3 weeks 9 lbs & still does at 5 weeks 12 lbs with some room to grow.
+1	My daughter has been in sleep sacks since birth and Halo is by far the best brand.  This is a great summer weight sleep sack that is very very soft.  They hold up very well to weekly washings.I had a long debate whether or not to get the early walker one for my 15 mo who has been walking for 5 months.  I'm glad I didnt - I don't have to worry about her wearing socks and most of the time she isn't walking in it ( and even the few times she had she is fine).  My daughter is a bigger than the average 15 mo but the 12-18 mo fits great and she should be able to wear it for another 4-6 months.  I would say they run a tad large.
+1	We are on our third size of Halo sleep sacks and love them!  My daughter can't wait to get into hers at night.  This particular one is very light weight so has been great for the warm summer.
+1	A bit warm for summer but it is a great spring and fall blanket! Love the cream too. Simple and neutral.
+1	This HALO sleep sack is the perfect weight. Keeps baby warm, but not too warm. The size chart is about right. I have a very long baby, but he was in the small until almost 6mo.
+1	Our baby likes to wiggle and kick - a lot!  With the sleepsack, we don't have to worry about baby wiggling and getting caught  underneath a blanket.  The 100% cotton one keeps him just warm enough in the summer/airconditioned room, without being too hot.  And it still gives baby enough room to kick-kick-kick!
+1	This is exactly what I was looking for.  Nice soft cotton is warm without being too hot.  I like the reverse zipper for changing baby's diaper without having to completely uncover him.
+1	Love this sleepsack for my daughter. She always kicks her blankets off and this is perfect to keep her covered. I put her in a long sleeve onesie with the Halo sack. I will order a fleece one for the winter!
+1	We use one of these everyday for naptime. My big boy is 17 months and this fits him perfectly and probably will for a few more months.
+1	My husband found our newborn's face covered in his blanket one morning and gave us quite a scare. I purchased two Halo sleepsacks, one in cotton and one in fleece after that incident. I bought it a size bigger so that my baby can have extra leg room. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made for my baby. Highly recommended!
+1	just a side note, the small fit my son up until he was about 7 months 1 week old. we bought the medium hoping it would be good and it wasnt... it is GREAT! there is plenty of room for him to grow in it and its long. if you live in a colder climate i would suggest at least a long sleeve onsie on under it like we use. our baby is a heat machine so he gets too warm in these with pjs on under it but too cold with just a onsie or pjs. great alternative to a blanket and much safer
+1	Love this Sleepsack! It keeps my baby warm all night long without the hassle of having his blanket being kicked off and getting tangled. My son is a wiggle worm and does somersaults in his sleep, and this is the perfect blanket for him! Love it! Highly recommended.
+1	Because it's cotton, material breathes better than the fleece counterpart. We bought this for our infant to wear in the winter since we keep our house very warm. And our lil one is one sweaty baby. One star deducted since after washing and drying, the zipper wrinkles up and does not lay flat.
+1	This is an absolutely amazing product and a must have for infants.  i say may be toddler too escpially the ones like my son who move a lot during sleep.
+1	Once my daughter was able to roll over, we couldn't use the swaddles anymore because of SIDS risk, so I switched to these sleeveless Halo sleep sacks for her naps. I really loved the pink cupcake design and the cotton fabric is super soft and breathable at the same time. After many washings, the designs never faded and the fabric remained in tact. I loved using these because I was never afraid of SIDS, yet I knew she was nice and warm in these, even in the winter. I loved that because the zipper ends at the bottom instead of the top, you can just unzip the bottom half of it for diaper changes instead of having to take the whole thing off. It's thin enough for summer time so that she's not overheating in it.My only complaint is that the fabric isn't very stain resistant and even if you wash it immediately after a spit up and use Shout spray on the stain, it doesn't always come all the way out. But overall, this is a great product and an absolute necessity for the nursery. In fact, we used these until my daughter was almost 2 and able to use a real blanket.
+1	We got an X-Large for our 10-month, and he is kind of swimming it, but that's not a problem, for it's like a blanket.  Our little guy likes to pull his socks off, and he likes to kick his covers off.  This remedies both, yet he can still move all around in his crib.  These are perfect.  So glad we got them!
+1	My son is almost 14 months and went from swaddling to this sleep sack.  He wears the XL now.  I like the fact that he has extra coverage at night but that it's safe too (blankets may be kicked off or cover his face).  These wash well, stains come out easily, and keep my son warm.  LOVE.
+1	Overalll I love this sleepsack as it helps my 10 month old recognize nap & bedtimes and she is able to sleep in every position imaginable without getting tangled. It helped her to sleep in positions other than her back, which is great for her flat head! She can also stand up in her crib (most of the time) without it interfering.  I would have given it 5 stars except that I have trouble with the zipper after having used if for a few months... I have now figured out a trick to help zip it closed (holding the zipper tines just so), but it was a very frustrating few weeks with baby sleeping in a open sack! The upside down zipper is key for night time diaper changes.
+1	My daughter is 18 months old and we've been using these since she was about 5 months old (prior to that we used the Halo swadlers).  She is still moving around a lot in her crib at night so a traditional blanket would just come off of her and get bunched up.  She likes to be warm when she sleeps so this is great for keeping her toasty as she does her overnight gymnastics.
+1	Purchased for my granddaughter to keep her warm at night in her crib. It does a nice job and takes the place of a blanket which people these days say is unsafe. I don't know about that but my daughter trusts it so oh well.
+1	Our daughter has been using sleep sacks since she was an infant.  Now at 15 months, we still put it on her to cue her that it's bed time and make sure her feet stay warm.  I don't think she has the dexterity to put a blanket on her quite right, though we have introduced one in her crib and she's starting to snuggle with it.  Until I am sure, these things are great for keeping her snug.
-1	I loved the fleece version of this and bought the cotton one for summer.  Big mistake.  Don't waste your money.  The cotton is not pre-shrunk, so when you wash it the first time and it shrinks, the zipper ends up being too long, which causes the fabric to gather/bunch up.  Very disappointed.
+1	I have this sleep sack in small and medium and I plan on buying it in the large, if my little one isn't standing up by then.  Our daughter liked to kick her blanket off in the night and then would wake up because she was cold.  We got the small sleep sack and she would sleep soundly through the night.  She's 6 months old now, and 18 lbs. and the medium sleepsack has been equally wonderful.  I don't have to worry that she's getting cold now, and she actually likes to be zipped up in it!  I also don't have to worry about blankets coming untucked and being pulled over her face.To wash, I just throw it in the washer and then the dryer and it comes out beautifully.  I highly recommend this item!
+1	With SIDS to worry about, I really do sleep more soundly at night knowing that my baby is warm but not at risk of being smothered by a loose blanket.  The bottom-to-top zipper really is convenient for diaper changes, and while the sleepsack did shrink somewhat in the wash, that really hasn't affected its fit on our baby.  We went from a fleece sleepsack (infant size) to a cotton one (medium) when the weather started getting warm.  Our baby is big (11 lbs 22 1/2 inches at 6 weeks), so we got a medium (one size larger than recommended) hoping it would fit all summer.  We shouldn't have worried.  The sizes are very generous, but even a very big sleepsack works - there's enough room to grow into without being loose enough at the arm- or neckholes to cause tangling or a smothering hazard.  Overall, I wouldn't trade the sleepsack for a regular blanket, and I highly recommend it to all parents of infants.
+1	OK, so your baby is too old to be swaddled and now wont sleep through the night right? My husband and I had this same problem and I thought I would never get sleep again. We saw this and gave it a shot. Thank GOD for this. My daughter has been sleeping through the night since she was 6 weeks old and this helps!!! Your baby stays warm in this plus stays safe. Having the feet in the pouch lets her play with her feet, but they get bored really fast and go to sleep. The baby can still move around so you dont have to worry. I tell every mom I run into about this if they dont know about it. Really worth the money
+1	This is great if your kiddo moves while sleeping! On a cool night you toss this on, zip it up, and they're good to go, no matter where they go! Mine is all over the place as she sleeps so keeping a blanket on would be a nightmare. It's also nice- the cooler fabric ones- for a warm night with just a diaper so your kid doesn't take their diaper off. I would highly recommend this to anyone! We started using one at about 3 months and still do! (She's 1 year now)
+1	We've used the newborn winged sleep sack, the small sleep sack, and have now jumped up to the large sleep sack. My baby's just about to outgrow the small (length-wise) and would probably fit the medium perfectly, but as it is winter I am layering the large over the small. It's definitely roomy around the arms and neck, but layering the sleep sacks has been working well for us! I definitely recommend the HALO SleepSacks as they are functional, affordable, and hold up well in the wash.
+1	I use this instead of blankets for my son and its perfect! I have been buying the Halo sleep sacks since he was born and I always rest assured knowing he won't get tangled in his covers
+1	I love this product because it provides cover, but it's not terribly heavy.  I also like that I can use this so I do not have to put sheets or blankets in her bed.  This product works well with the Ultimate Crib Sheet (see:http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Comfort-Ultimate-Crib-Sheet/dp/B00003XAKPWith these two things, you can make your baby's crib safe!
+1	This product is fantastic!I live in Texas which has cool winters, but not frigid ones. I put the sleepsack on my newborn over a footed cotton sleeper, and she's very cozy and content. I would recommend it over the fleece sack for folks who live in warmer climates. That would be too much. I imagine the thickness of the cotton sleeper will work well during warmer months as well coupled with a lighter sleeper or onesie underneath.In addition to doing a great job keeping my baby warm, this product is wonderfully soft and well-designed. It's roomy and should fit my baby for a while (unlike most things you buy for baby!). And, best of all, it unzips from the bottom to the top. So, you don't have to completely undress baby for those late-night diaper changes.I highly recommend buying two or three to use every night. I only wish I had discovered the sleepsack with my first child.
+1	My 3 year old won't give these up.  She wears her XL sleep sacks every night.  She's got the walk perfected where she jams her toes into the corners and shuffles along.  She refuses to size up to the ones that have feet holes.  So is this a good thing? I don't really like it but she does.  You can get a lot of wear out of the cotton sacks even if your kid is far beyond just standing.
+1	I've used these sleep sacks with both of my kids, each born at complete opposite times of the year as the other, and I love them.  They do get a little bunched up sometimes but nothing that I've constituted as dangerous and they keep the kids warm without getting in the way.  The only thing I wish is that they made a long sleeved version so I didn't have to put on a long-sleeved onesie to keep my kids' arms warm.
+1	As an old school grandma I was not sure any baby would ever sleep comfortably on his back without a cuddly blanket and stuffed toys. Well, they do, and do so safely with this great design.  Out baby is quite happy in this wearable blanket, part of his bedtime routine and he is content. Stays covered all night, fabric is soft, zips away from face with zipper stop cover. Price is good, shipping is faster than direct order from Halo.Have compared to other brands (mostly European) and like these best.
+1	When I was pregnant I couldn't understand why these were so popular especially at the cost of $20 each.  I could get cheaper ones at target and Carter's Baby and to me that was good enough.  Anyhow the cheaper ones never really took off, the sleeves on the Carter's ones never fit him properly and were too warm, the bags were also not that big and constricted him so using them was always a battle.  I quickly gave them up.  Anyway my now nearly 6 month old loves grabbing things and after a night episode where he wrapped the blanket around his face twice the next day I was at babiesrus to check the Halo sleepsacks out.  I bought two in size medium and love them.  The zip is inverted which allows for quick diaper changes without unzipping the whole bag.  The bag is also large enough for him to kick, lift his legs and move freely.  The armholes also fit nicely without being too wide.  I am sold!!! I see you can get up to XL so I guess I will be using these for a while! I am going today to buy two more for him to use at daycare.
+1	I like this sleepsack.  It's soft, and not too thick and not too thin.  My son sleeps really well in it.
+1	I'm so grateful for this product. It keeps my mind at ease knowing my baby is safe and comfortable. Definitely will be buying more.
+1	So cozy! Gets thicker with each wash. My son is 37 pounds and almost 40 inches and he fits in the XL. We got him one with leg openings but that didn't work out.My son sleeps sooo good with these sleep sacks- everyone comments on his good sleeping and I really think it's due to him being so cozy in the sleep sack.
+1	The cotton Halo is perfect for warm summer nights. I've washed it (cold water) and dried it (very hot air) dozens of times, no problems whatsoever :)
+1	Keeps my son covered up during the night when he tosses and turners. Like that it opens from the bottom. The fabric is soft and strong. Washes great. Wish there were more vibrant colors.
-1	I have both the Halo fleece sleep sack and this cotton one. The cotton one is very flimsy and doesn't compare in quality to the fleece one - if you want a cotton sleep sack - why not just put the baby in a nightgown? The fleece one, however, is aweseom (even though I like the LullaBag slightly better than the Halo fleece sleep sack)
+1	Halo's cotton sleep sacks are perfect for that transition from winter coolness to springtime temps. I have tried other brands of sleep sacks but keep coming back to Halo. The fit is excellent- the arms holes are snug but not tight and the zipper starts at the top/closes at the bottom so little fingers can't reach the zipper to take it off. There is still some give so that restless sleepers don't twist it. Get two! When one is in the wash, you'll have the other.
+1	This sleep sack is awesome. It's quality fabric and it's very soft. I wanted something for my LO to wear over her jammies that would be a little extra something that would keep her warm without her overheating and this is perfect.
+1	This is by far the best item I have ever purchased for my baby.  Its made of a light cotton material.  Its thicker than plain sheets.  My son has almost outgrown it but the next stage is not made of the same material.  It is big and will last a while.
+1	Whoever invented sleepsacks is obviously a parent.  It's a genius way to give babies an extra level of warmth without the danger of a blanket in the crib.  Our girls know that putting the sack on at night signals that it's time for sleep which is even better.Bonus, when they get a little older and are starting to climb, it's much harder for them to climb out of the crib with the sack on.  :)
+1	It's soft and easy to wear. My daughter like it. If there's newborn size, that's will be much better. But small size is suitable, too.
+1	Big fans of halo sleepsacks because of the quality and upside down zipper.  So much easier to just change their diaper and zip them back up. OR, in our case, to unzip slightly to check if their socks are still on without making a big fuss over the zipper and waking them up too much. The cotton ones seem to shrink a little bit after the dryer (gentle cycle wash, low heat dry).Follow the length and weight guidelines for size... not age.Preemie: 14 to 19 in, Birth to 5 lbsNewborn: 19 to 23 in, 6 to 12 lbsSmall: 23 to 26 in, 10 to 18 lbsMedium: 26 to 30 in, 16 to 24 lbsLarge: 30 to 35 in, 22 to 28 lbsX Large: 35 to 40 in, 26 to 36 lbs
+1	I feel my baby is safer wearing this convenient sleepsack than wearing a blanket. And it stays on when my baby started rolling over in her sleep.
+1	We love the halo brand sleep sacks. We have used both the cotton and micro fleece ones. The cotton one is much thinner than the fleece one. Like the thickness of a tshirt. Comes on and off easily and lasts.
+1	Okay when I had my first set of b/g twins 3 years ago, I was certain that I didnt need alot of the ridiculous baby products on the market. Well I will tell you that my twins SCREAMED every time we changed them, and we could not figure it out, I think the nieghbors even thought that someone was being murdered, SERIOUSLY! We honestly didnt know what was wrong until they were 2 and we heard someone else had the same problem, but our twins were almost potty trained, so we didnt get a wipes warmer. But with our second set of twins b/b, we registered for ALL of the "ridiculous" baby products, AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST! We wet the sponge very frequently, and we have never had a brown or dried out wipe. We replace the sponge about every 2-3 weeks or so. Unlike some other wipes warmers, this keeps the wipes warm long enought to actually wipe a babies bottom. We love them, our boys love them and we even had to buy a portable wipes wrmer! I am telling you that this product WILL save you many headaches. (we keep ours in the den by the PNP's(thats the most frequent changing station) and keep the travel one in the babies nursery) and in the diaper bag)***** UPDATEWell I just found the perfect wipe, as one of the next reviewers said, PAMPERS. They pop up nicely, and they never get dry. But if you are more interested in very moist, comfortable wipes, I think huggies are better. Or if you just want to save some money and dont care if the wipes dont pop up and get a little drier, get LUVS. But I think I would recomend Pampers, they are nice, just not as "fluffy" as Huggies. But when my boys have diaper rash I tend to use Huggies!
+1	This is a GREAT item to have for new babies! I've read a lot of complaints about it dryin the wipes out, but any wipe warmer will do that if not properly maintained (read the instructions). I've tested several different brands/types of baby wipes with this, and THE WIPES THAT WORK BEST WITH THIS WARMER ARE: *HUGGIES SUPREME* (the plain, unscented, non-aloe/shea butter/whatever else, in the red package that says "Huggies Supreme") and you can get them in big refill packages. They rarely ever dry out in the warmer, even when the insert is dryed out; all other wipes I've ever tried with this have dried out, even when the "stay-moist" pad was kept watered.Basically, when your wipes run out, touch the "stay-moist" pad, the special insert to keep the wipes moist DOES dry out itself from time to time, but if you soak it in distilled water for about 10 minutes you can put it back in and it works just fine. Also, what I did was unplug this (you can disconnect the cord @ the back of the unit, without have to unplug from the wall, which is a nice feature) during the day when we were gone and plugged it back in when we arrived back home, which also helped to keep the wipes moist.This is such a nice thing to have especiially for the first 6-mo. to 1-year, for those middle-of-the-night feedings and changes. The warm wipes really help to keep the baby calm, because cold wipes can sometimes shock them when they've just woken up and are hungry and crabby anyway. Just imagine, if YOU wake-up @ 3 am, you stomach is howling for food, it's dim and dark, you have a squishy sack of something strapped around your waist, and then someone takes a cold, moist washrag and puts it on your neck. You'd probably yell and curse. Well, babies do, too, when wipes are cold. It was wonderful to NOT have a howling newborn at 2-o'clock in the morning, when mommy (and/or daddy) is drowsy and sleep-deprived. It lessend the stress on everyone.I used this up until my son was about 1-1/2, then I realized that he was probably old enough to go without. He had to get used to the cold wipes, but after a while he didn't miss much.I recommend this to all expecting mothers and have given it as a baby shower/new baby gift on several ocassions, just because it's a nice "luxury" item to have that not many people think of getting (with all the other planning going on). Makes a great gift, and is on my "MUST HAVE" list for for new babies!
+1	The wipe warmer has been working great for a few weeks. Our baby really enjoys the nice warm wipes. A must for cold weather.
-1	This warmer broke after only 2 months of use. It as extremely hot on the bottom and every time you grab a wipe,it opens so you end up having to use two hand to operate. The whole warmer is quite heavy and when moved it's cumbersome, not for easy diaper changes in another room. Only wipes that worked in it were Pampers, all other we have to pull out by opening it. What a waste of money! I have since purchased a Munchkin Warmer and was VERY pleased with that one thus far. That model has a lock on the door, as to not fly open every time you grab a wipe!
+1	I bought this when my son was born 27 months ago and have never had one problem with it.  Replacing the moist pad is easy and affordable.  They last for a few months if you soak them in water to clean them between wipes refills.  I could not have lived with out this wipes warmer the past two years of changing diapers.  I highly recommend it!
+1	We have the older model without the rubber pop-up helper and better latch, and this new version as well. It is MUCH improved.
+1	This is a great wipes warmer. I only used it though until my son was a few weeks old. Then I stopped using it because the cold wipes didn't bother him anymore. It is worth the money though and regardless of what other people say the wipes do not dry out or turn brown. My wipes were always very moist. I got my use out of it and I will more than likely use it again for my next baby.
+1	Love this! No more screaming during diaper changes. If you keep the inside moist, you will not have problems with browning.
+1	I liked the idea of warm wipes from the moment I'd heard of it. I just couldn't imagine putting a cold wet cloth on my baby's tushy in the dead of winter.  Second to an electric bottle warmer, this is much needed and I know she appreciates me using it :-).  One downside to this is if you don't keep the sponge fairly moistened with water, it will brown and harden.  But overall, this is a really great invention.
-1	I bought this baby wipe warmer in hopes that it was compatible with german housing. Well it wasnt. I should have read more into it. It basically just serves as a very expensive wipes holder. I dont really know how well it warmes up as I haven't been able to use it.
+1	I'm very happy with this product and have had no issues. I use Huggies wipes and have and no issue with using them with this warmer. This is the first one I've owned, but def the most affordable one I've found and it works great.  It has a little spongy pad you soak with water and place in the bottom. The wipes go on top. Yes, the pad will dry out if you don't soak it again.  I actually wet it twice a week, whenever my wipes run out (I use at least 3 every change). Just put it in the sink and run some water over it, if you forget it will get hard and start to turn brown but just wet it again. The little nite light on the front is cute too. No issues with dry wipes or browning wipes. The ones closer to the pad do seem to be warmer than the ones at the very top of the stack, but that would make sense.
-1	Invest in better quality wipes rather than this wipe warmer.  Wipes cool off before you can get them out and put into use. Sponge drys out too quickly and can pose a hazard. We ended up having to rewet ours almost every day. Not worth the hassle. Baby will adjust to wipes from the box in no time.
-1	I returned this wipe warmer to the store when I realized that it uses a wall wart rather than a standard electrical plug.  I will probably buy the Especially for Baby warmer, which does not use a wall wart.  Do you ever wonder why manufacturers use wall warts?  Because it's cheaper to get UL certification for a wall wart than to get certification for the whole device.
+1	I didn't think that I needed this item so I didn't bother putting it on my registry but I ended up getting one for my shower.  I am glad that I did.  My son does not get "startled" anymore by cold wipes.  It does a good job of keeping the wipes moist.  It doesn't brown the wipes unless you are like me and forget to soak the white pad at the bottom of the warmer.  The manufacturer recommends checking on the pad frequently in order to avoid browning.  I like that fact that you can throw the pad into the wash and it comes out white and clean again.  The manufacturer also recommends doing this about every 2 weeks.  I also like that you can use two different types of wipes:  1) pop-up 2) standard wipes.  I recommend this product especially if you have a baby who hates cold wipes.
-1	I found that in order to keep the wipes warm you had to severly saturate the sponge on the bottom.  Which in turn would leave your wipes so wet you might as well use a wet towel.  The concept works but the design is worthless.
+1	We use Pampers Sensitive Wipes with this wipe warmer, and it does a great job of keeping them warm.  My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to warm them all up. Like 4 hours. But it does not dry them out,and my baby boy appreciates the warm wipes in the middle of the night.
+1	I think this is the best invention ever! The wipes are warm regardless of the weather or tem in the room. My son doesn't even know we're changing him at night sometimes. I love that it fits into the &quot;Diaper Depot&quot;. I have the most organized changing station. It's true that you ruin a few of the very last wipes on the bottom due to drying up & browning, but who cares, it's pennies! Plus my baby's comfort is the most important thing!!P.S. if you wet the pad on the bottom thoroughly enough & often enough, it doesn't dry up anything!I love it!
+1	My daughter doesn't care if her wipes are warm or cold.  However, I am a big fan of the warmer.  It keeps the wipes really wet, thus they work better!  I also like that I can keep the wipes out on her changing table without the ugly plastic package.  As for the drying out problem that other reviewers have mentioned I just keep a bottle of water in her changing table cupboard and pour some in every couple of days.  There is no rule about how much water one can pour in at one time so when I refill the warmer I put quite a bit of water in and make sure the pad is soaked on each side.  I think it's well worth it; wetter wipes work better so I can use two warm wipes when I otherwise would've used three or four cold, sort of dry wipes.
+1	Unlike some reviewers I've been using this for over three months with no issues. As long as you use the included moist pack and keep it moist per directions the wipes stay warm, moist and white. No yellowing or browning and no drying out!
+1	Love the warmer and my son loves it too!  Changing him at night with a breezy draft and wet cold wipes always wakes him up until I got this warmer.  The warmth of the wipes does make a difference to me and it's well worth every penny.  Highly recommended.  The only concern I had was, the sponge on the bottom does discolor (but it's normal according to the instructions) and I recommend cleaning it at least once every week or two weeks too keep it from drying out.  I replaced the sponged over couple of months.
+1	I love this wipes warmer! The 1st one I broke (because I never wiped it dry after refilling water, so it was rusted at the back of the unit where the connector was), so I went ahead and bought my 2nd one!
-1	OK, I got this at my shower, and I thought it was pretty neat. But I am basically using it as just a glorified wipe box, because it's too much of a pain to do the warming part.  There is this cloth that you put in the bottom that you have to make sure is always moist, and you have to keep it moist with bottled or distilled water.  So I just throw a package of refills in it and use it just like that, with no warming.  It looks really nice in my nursery, nicer than just a refillable box of Pampers wipes or something, but not worth the money to use just like this.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, so it was nice to receive it as a shower gift.Plus, I like having my baby used to room temp wipes, because when I go out with her and do diaper changes with room temp wipes, she is used to it and doesn't throw a fit.  She didn't like room temp wipes at first, but now she expects them at room temp and doesn't mind diaper changes at all!
+1	I have nothing but great things to say about this wipe warmer. If my baby needs a midnight change he doesn't even notice that I am changing him because he doesn't feel a cold wipe on his bottom! I highly recommend!
+1	I'm not sure how much there is to say about a wipes warmer, except that it works really well. We use it for cloth wipes, we replace the little pad thingy every six months, it keeps wipes at just the right temperature, and works great. Obviously, you cannot use the pop-up feature for cloth wipes, but that isn't a problem for us. We tried not getting one and I ordered one about a week into the baby being born because he already didn't like diaper changes and then a cold wipe on his tush just made it all the worse. This did help. Thus, especially suggested if your little one is already not a fan of diaper changes.Great shower present - not something people think they will need, but very nice to have.A+
-1	Do NOT buy this! This is a fire hazard. Look at the other reviews for the same warmer. My, along with far to many others, ac adapters are burning, some say melting, yet still running. Thank God we all found them. A very scary reality!
-1	The wipes dry out quickly or are too soggy, there was no in between. Furthermore, this thing is really a gimmick "you must have this for your child to be a good mother!" piece of junk. YOur baby won't die of hypothermia if you don't have a wipe warmer. If the thing is that cold, hold it in your hand for a few minutes. Sold mine on ebay. Don't waste your time or money. Put the twenty bucks in your kid's college fund instead. It's a much better investment
+1	We've had this wipe warmer since our son was born (he is now 6 months). I wasn't sure what I thought about it at first because of a few things:1) It took a a whole day and sometimes longer for the wipes to warm up once you put them in.2) It always seemed to dry the wipes out after a few days of being in there.3) It was always really hard pulling them through the opening at the top to get them out. For the longest time we were just opening it up where you put the wipes in to get them. It gets the job done, but it's not what I would have expected.A few weeks ago I decided to try a different brand of wipes. We were previously using Huggies brand wipes. I purchased Member's Mark wipes from Amazon and this really has made all this difference. I don't have any problems now whatsoever. The wipes heat up a lot faster because they are a little thinner than Huggies. They haven't dried out yet, and we've had the same pack in there for a week. We can also pull them through the top perfectly now. Even though the wipes are thin, they are very soft and durable so they still get the job done, even with the messiest diaper changes.All in all, I have really grown to love this product. It might be inconvenient for some people to have to buy a specific brand of wipes to get the best use out of it, but I don't mind doing it.
+1	Its a pretty good wipe warmer. Keeps wipes pretty moist. Also fits on the Prince Lionheart diaper depot. The only real drawbacks are that it doesn't have any way to secure it to the changing table without the diaper depot... and it is a bit bulky.
+1	My 5th baby hates cold wipes so I got this.  Wow does it work well.  Such toasty warm wipes for sure.  I would buy again.
+1	If you want a warmer, this is a good one.  True, the wipes never brown, but the pad does if you forget to freshen it with water.  Fortunately, the company does sell replacement pads.  I agree with another reviewer - don't put in the entire wipes pack.  If you do, the lid will pop open until the wipes go down in use.  It will also take a long time for them to warm as this is a 'bottom up' warmer.  Water does accumulate on the inside of the lid and sides, but if you use the pop-up type of wipes, this isn't a huge problem as you won't have to lift the lid.  As with any wipes warmer, you must use the wipe as soon as you remove it from the warmer or it will become cold within seconds.  This product isn't really necessary for me and my baby (I probably wouldn't register for it if I had it to do over), but I have friends who just love theirs.  It just all depends on your diapering style and your baby.
+1	I bought this to go on top of my Prince Lionheart diaper caddy/organizer and use it strictly as a wipes dispenser (i.e., I don't plug it in). I like it because it stays stationary and the pop-up lid is easy to use - both features make a 2am diaper change easier. I give it 4 stars only because I can't comment in its effectiveness as a warmer.
+1	This is a life saver for new born bottoms.  It makes changing time much more pleasant.  There is a pad to hold in moisture in the bottom but honestly I found myself pouring in a bit of water from time to time to keep the wipes moist.  Otherwise a perfect device.
-1	I bought this when I was pregnant thinking I really needed this.  It turned out to be a bigger pain to have it.  Don't bother.  Buy more wipes or diapers with the money you save from buying this.
+1	This isn't a "necessary" baby item, and we did without it for 14 months. At about 14 months my son started hating diaper changes, so I thought maybe he'd enjoy it better if he had a warm wipe instead of a cold one, well, it didn't matter, he still throws a fit (for anyone thinking that it'll solve the same problem) as it comes with the age. But it is nice to have a warm wipe. I usually wet the pillow (or I rinse it out before adding new wipes) and put 2 drops tea tree oil onto the pillow directly to hopefully keep mold out (no mold yet, and I'm not sure if that's the reason or something else). We also use cloth wipes (he's allergic to something in every disposable wipes we've tried) and I put tea tree oil into the solution I make up so that should help with mold too. It works great for cloth wipes, they stay moist, and if folded in there right they pop up out of the top too, which makes it nice. Is it worth buying if you're on the fence? Not really, you can warm a wipe up by holding it in your hand a few seconds. It won't be WARM, but it won't be freezing either that way. But if you want to use warm wipes, this is definitely a good product.
-1	Returned it right back after couple days. It never warmed any wipes, barely fit any wipes--What is the point of even having it?
+1	I gave it a 4 star because I bought the one up from this one about 4 months ago and all of a sudden it stopped working.  I bought it in Babies R us in Canada and declined the warranty. (at an additional cost)  Low and behold it stopped working.  go figure.  I came on Amazon and bought the cheaper one and here we have it.  Actually it is working much better than the first.
+1	Love love love this thing!! As far as some people saying the pillow turns brown. It's very light and if you resoak the pillow properly it goes away no problems. The refills are cheap. Doesn't dry out wipes like some people complain. Bought a second one to keep at grandmas house so my baby's fanny can stay warm everywhere we go!! Way cheaper here then in store!
-1	Warmer keeps wipes warm but the top pops open repeatedly no matter what we try making the top wipe cold and ultimately drying out the wipes.  I wouldn't buy this again
+1	I really like this product.  I put in the Huggies pop up wipes and don't really have any problems.  When the wipes are getting down to the bottom, they sometimes fall through the top so I have to pull them back through.  I re-wet the fresher pad everytime I add more wipes and I've never had dried or browned wipes.  Besides, what baby doesn't like a warm wipe versus a cold one?
+1	We use it.  We love it.  The only drawback is that if you use the pop up opening, the wipes are no longer warm.  I recommend that you avoid wipes designed for pop up dispensers (e.g. Pampers) and keep the wipes in the main compartment.
+1	sure, this is kind of a luxury item but i figure my baby deserves all the pampering in the world! those wet wipes get pretty cold in the winter (and the summer with the ac on) and i think it's just a nice thing to do for the munchkin (i think i'd prefer my wipes warm!). if you do get this, just remember to wet down the spongey insert thing once a week like they instruct you to. i forgot a couple of times and dried it out a bit.
-1	This thing worked for about a month, then it stopped working completely! Shame, I thought I'd finally found a wipes warmer that worked! I've tried the munchkin and had to send that one back to! I recommend just staying away from wipe warmers at all, and warm your babies wipes with warm sink water, none of the wipes warmers I've given a chance have delivered! Buy at own risk!
+1	Would have loved this for my kids way back when.  Nothing worse than changing a baby in the middle of the night only to have them scream in shock over cold wipes on their butt.  This solves the problem.  I thought this was a stupid luxury item when my daughter told me about it...but after she kept raving about it, I picked one up for my grandson who spends one night a week with me and I just love it.  I will say that if it sits unused for any long amount of time the upper wipes discolor.  I unplug it during the week when not in use and haven't had any issues.  I've had family members request that I put one in the bathroom for personal use and I will say that if you like moist wipes in the bathroom, this is SO much nicer.
+1	This is a good product.  My daughter is very laid back, knock on wood, but I thought this would be especially nice for those midnight diaper changes when she was young because it wouldn't wake her up as much as a cold wipe would, and it didn't.  I also haven't had a single wipe turn brown, and the wipes have never dried out on me either even when I wasn't home to use them for over a week!  My daughter definately seems to like the warm wipes better as she doesn't ever flinch or cry like she will with the cold ones.
+1	perfect size and color. keeps my baby wipes warm, so no more late nights changing diapers with cold wipes. Now my son have soft, moist and warm wipes.
+1	Was a gift and they love it.  Easy to use. All wipe brands fit nicely inside.  Temperature remains constant. Good value and makes a welcome gift.
+1	Great product.  I love this and haven't had a problem changing my son yet.  The wipes are always nice and warm.  The only problem I have is the sponge thing on the bottem.  You are suppose to get it from drying out but I had a hard time keep it moist.  So I threw mine out and it still works for me.
+1	Let me preface this by saying I didn't put this on my shower gifts as I thought that this was a waste of money.  With that attitude and frame of mind ...I got this as a shower present 2 years ago and have used it happily since then with no problems whatsoever.  I would highly recommend it.  It does it's purpose of keeping the wipes warm, esp in the winter.  I'm realistic about my expectations.  For the price, I think it would have been worth it to purchase on my own.--To note, I don't always change the pillow as your supposed to (I think only 4 times in the past 2 years) but there is usually always water in it.--If you run the pillow under water and work the "hardness" out it seems to lengthen the use.  I have not had any problems with the lid.--After a few weeks, I actually purchased a rack to put this on as the bottom does get warm and I didn't want it to hurt his dresser top (which doubles as a changing table).--Are the last few wipes brown?  Yes, but there are trade offs.  It's also because the pillow hasn't been changed so partially my fault.--No problems with the lids.--I use mostly pampers wipes as I didn't not like huggies (too dry).  But I did use huggies since I had purchased some.  I didn't try any other brands so I didn't have any problems with "pop-ups" like others.  I did my research on wipes before purchasing any and understand the product I was purchasing and if it was compatable with a wipes warmer.  So again, its about realistic expectations for a product.I haven't used any other wipe warming product so I have nothing to compare it to but I'm expecting baby #2 and will probably use this until it breaks and then will purchase a new one.  Also, this has been in continuous use for the past 2 years.
-1	When we first got this wipes warmer we were mostly pleased with it. Our only complaint was that you had to add water to the bottom pad every time that you changed to a new packet of wipes.Fast forward 8 months later and it became a pain to close the lid completely as it would pop back open. That meant that the one wipe that would be at the top would be hard and dry by the time of the next diaper change. Multiply that to about 6 changes a day, that meant I was loosing 6 wipes a day or 180 a month. Not acceptable!Then by the time our baby was 16 months old the wipes warmer stopped working completely. We tried several outlets, and the light would still be on as if it was working but it would not warm the wipes anymore! This while we were in the middle of this crazy Polar Vortex winter with so many days of record low temperatures and many snow storms that I lost count.I was hoping this warmer would last us for a longer time than 16 months. So We DO NOT recommend it to anyone and would try our luck with a different brand next time around.
+1	I bought this to use with cloth wipes and I couldn't be more satisfied.  I just soak my wipes in warm water with a tablespoon of coconut oil and two drops of tea tree oil, then I roll them up and pack them in.  Holds enough for two days.
+1	Any baby would hate a cold wipe. When my daughter was only 1 week old, I was going crazy and went to the store and bought this. She screamed every time we took her diaper off, and it was b/c she knew that cold wipe was coming!!! After we got this, she dosent mind at all. I haven't had a problem with it at all. Once in a while, a drop or two of water will spill out when you open it (I still havent tried the pop up wipes) but, usually it is b/c I have a little too much water in the bottom. Do keep the wet 'cusion' wet though... if you forget to wet it (usually 1-2 times a week) it becomes hard, and you will have to soak it to get it back to normal. I have bought the refill pad/ cusion for it as well. They come 2 to a pack and I think it cost me about $6 - $7 by mail including shipping. However, I just put the first replacement in - I used the original for almost 6 months.
+1	You can't live without one of these with a newbie! It saves from the "shock" of something cold on your babies tush! Think about it do you use something cold on your tush...so why should your baby!Make sure you stock up on replacement pillows...you will need them about every month or two! Highly recommend for all new parents to be!
-1	I like the idea of warm wipes for baby...but I was very disappointed with this product.  First of all, the dispenser is useless.  We got so frustrated trying to get the wipes to dispense properly out of the top that we just gave up and opened the whole unit to get to them during changes.  Second, the wipes are cold again about a second after you remove them from the container.  I think this is defintely one of those products that you can do without.We have now just unplugged the thing and use it as an attractive wipes holder!
+1	No baby wants a cold wipe to their bottom!  This warmer has been plugged in and used for over a year now and it is still awesome.  Just make sure you check the sponge filter on the bottom and get wet when necessary and this will be you and your baby's best friend!  I buy these for all new moms!
+1	I make my own wipes using hot water and medical non-sterile gauze sponge so I have to open the lid to access the wipes. My wipes are kept warm but do get dried out and brown sometimes if I don't use them fast enough. Only thing I don't like is the sponge on the bottom that needs to be replaced every few months. It will get kinda reddish in color but I wash it and reuse it anyway. Not a bad product to have as long as you have the counter space.
+1	my baby was sensitive to the cold wipes for the first 2 months.but now it is of no use anymore. The wipes are not too warm, just not cold to the touch,thats all. I liked it the first 2 months a lot though.It served the purpose well.
-1	I always thought wipe warmers were kind of silly and frivolous. But my husband wanted to get this item because our newborn boy screams whenever a cold wipe touches his bottom. It had good reviews so thought we would give it a try. When we got it we were excited to see if it would help and got it all plugged in and set up. Based on what another reviewer said we only put a few wipes in instead of a whole package. Well we've only had this warmer a few days and we hate it!!! We change baby on the floor and the warmer is on a stand right next to where we change him. By the time you get a couple wipes out and go to use them, they are cold. Literally 2 seconds later. I suppose if you have this warmer sitting like 6 inches from where you change the baby and can grab them instantly before you wipe their bottom, it MIGHT work. But we also noticed even when you take the wipes out, they aren't all that warm to begin with. I expected a lot more, and pretty much this item is useless. :( Really disappointing.
+1	I love our wipe warmer!  I've also seen some of the negative feedback, and I don't have of those problems at all!  If you follow the directions with the package, your wipe warmer will be fine!  The Ever-Fresh pad at the bottom does dry out, but we just re-wet it each time we replace the wipes.  I've never had any wipes get brown or dried out.  The wipes stay warm long enough for me to use them - I just make sure to pull out a wipe as I need it.  And yes, some wipes are not made for the top part that allows another wipe to pull out after.  But all you need to do is buy the wipes that are folded that way.  I buy the Especially for Baby wipes in the big box.  You can get them at any Babies R Us or Toys R Us.  It costs about $10, and lasts us for over a month.  Plus, they're nice and soft and have no scent.The ONLY complaint I might have about the wipe warmer is that when I pull out a wipe, another wipe usually comes out with it unless I use 2 hands to pull.  But this is a minor issue.  I'd much prefer to have the wipe warmer.  This isn't a necessary item, but it's definitely something worthwhile to have!
+1	Very nice. Just don't forget to wet the stay fresh pad every week. It will turn brown and dry up
+1	My sister warned me BUT I was a clueless first-time mom and didn't listen.  She told me *get a wipe warmer*!  She said nothing makes a sleepy newborn more indignant than being awakened in the middle of the night by an ice-cold wipe on their delicate heiny.  (Okay the iciness of it is only relative to a nice pee-warmed diaper, but babies don't seem to care).Buh.  I just didn't get it until I my darling little sweetheart shrieked in alarm at 2am and then refused to be cuddled back to sleep.So, yes, add this to your shower list or your to-buy list.  Or if you are a friend, buy this for the first-timer and they will thank you.Pam T~
+1	I used this for both of my kids (16 months apart) and the wipes never dried out. This is great during the newborn phase when it is the middle of the night, they are drowsy and almost asleep but soiled their diaper during feeding and need a diaper change. Nothing wakes up a newborn like a cold wipe and the shriek screams that are amplified in a quiet home once they have awoken. I used this until they started to sleep through the night.
+1	So far, so good.  My daughters room is chilly so she use to fuss A Lot when I'd change her.  Not anymore!  The wipes are nice and warm now and this warmer seems to be keeping up.  I've had it going for a couple months now and I've had a couple annoyances with it.  #1 annoyance is having to keep moisture in it (absorbent sponge in the bottom).  It's not major but I tend to forget about it.  Generally when you need to refill the warmer, you need to remoisten then pad in the bottom (as a busy parent, that's not always convenient and easy to forget about).  Oh, which leads me to annoyance #2, which is that it doesn't hold a standard stack of wipes. It takes about 75% of the Huggies pre separated stacks of wipes. Overall, I like it and my daughter appreciates it.
+1	A year and a half later, this item is still one of my favorite baby items.  I read the reviews before buying and as a new mom i questioned if this was a silly product to have.  We live in san diego and it isn't cold often but I really enjoy this product and I think my daughter does too.  When i'm out and about and use the cold ones on hand, there is always a little flinch of being startled by the temperature of the wipe.I also love that it is in a protective case that the wipes pull so easily out of.  If it didn't warm, I would still buy this product just so I don't have to look at a pampers wipes case.I have never changed the pad underneath. Sometimes it dries out and I just run it under water until it is full (like a sponge) and put it back.  If you keep it wet, it doesn't turn brown...
+1	All I do is fold two dozen baby washcloths in half and pour in water. That's it!! You can use it for disposable wipes, too. Just use the spongy thing and make sure they stay damp.
+1	A friend of mine recommended this warmer to me and so I bought it and it did us good. It maintains the warmth and moisture for long. The moisture pad would dry out but you should soak it each time you refill the wipes, if not before.
+1	I think this seems like a very frivolous item to a lot of people, but put yourself in your baby's shoes.  Would you want a cold, wet wipe on your bottom in the middle of the night?  Trust me, warm wipes make for an easier (read: less crying/fussing) diaper change any time of day.We have used this warmer for both disposable and cloth wipes (now exclusively cloth wipes).  You really need to have the pillows for the bottom if you're using disposable wipes, and just be aware, they didn't ever last as long for us as they're supposed to.I was nervous using this for cloth wipes the first time (I would encourage anyone to use them as they're vastly superior to disposables!).  I wasn't sure it would heat through the stack of fabric wipes as well as it does with disposables.  I was also wary of using it without the pillow in the bottom.  However, I'm happy to say that this works really well with cloth wipes.  We go through them quickly with two kids in diapers, so I think you might have more issues if you're not refilling this every couple of days as we have to.  I pour a thin layer of water in the bottom before adding wipes, and that's worked just fine.  I love not having to buy those stupid pillows anymore!  I have scorched a wipe or two on the rare occasions when we're not going through wipes as quickly, but it's not a big deal and washes right out of the wipe.  If you're like me and are interested in this for cloth wipes, go for it!  Your baby's tush will thank you.
-1	I love this diaper wipe warmer and it has helped me a lot as a new mom, but one month after I bought it the top quit latching most of the time and pops back up.  It drives me crazy!  I love everything else about the wipe warmer and how much it has helped me, but the latch just doesn't keep.
+1	I wanted a wipe warmer for the simple fact of making diaper changes more comfortable for my son. This works so great as long as you frequently check the sponge at the bottom. It's very easy to do so don't let the other reviews fool you. All you have to do is press down on it and see if any moisture comes up. If you let it dry out, it's useless because it gets brick hard-trust me. I'd say you have to re-wet it twice a week and I would buy a new one every 3 months like it says. I don't put the whole holder filled with wipes and that makes it easier. I'd also rather not use any pop up wipes with it because using that mechanism doesn't keep them as warm. I like to open up the whole top part and pull out a nice warm wipe instead of a half way warmed wipe thru the top hole. And I've never had a problem with the top not staying latched-yes, I have used the top part plenty to know this.I made the mistake of letting my sponge get dry and it turned brown and hard so I already need to buy a new one before I can use it again. I also didn't buy distilled water, just used water out of our Brita pitcher and that works fine.The reason I gave it 4 stars is how often you have to maintain the water level of the sponge. It would be nice if you didn't have to check it so often and worry about it drying out so quick and turning into a brick.But it works great for its intended use and keeps baby happy as well.
+1	If you are doing CLOTH diapers and wipes, this is the wipes warmer for you!!  It's great for disposables to pop-up in case you ever stop using cloth ones, so why wouldn't you want to cover both if you can?! I have used this for 9 months now and wouldn't use anything else.The best thing about it is that you can have a pool of water in it if you want to dip cloth wipes into a solution.  It won't leak water out like the munchkin one will once filled more than 1/4 inch. It's also easier to clean than the munchkin; it has a flat bottom as opposed to a groved bottom. I used to put a cloth wipe solution in and dip the wipes and ring them out. Now, I prefer folding two kinds of wipes, placing them separate piles in the warmer, then pouring solution over them.
+1	We purchased this about 9 months ago and it has worked great. The wipes stay warm and they haven't dried out. It's VERY important to rinse out the pad inside every week or else it gets crusty and dirty. I've replaced the pad every few months. I would have given 5 stars but after about 8 months the lid stopped shutting and we were putting a tissue box on top to keep the lid down. I returned it to Amazon, free return shipping and they replaced the product- the lid seems to work much better on this one. It's one of those not necessary products but we found it really useful to have warm wipes with an infant who was born in the winter. Also we keep something in front of the green indicator light because it does glow quite a bit- might be good to find your way in a dark room but I didn't like it lighting up our nursery.
+1	My husband insisted on this for the boy, because he cried when we changed his diaper for the first month and a half of his life.We still use it. It is attractive to look at and does a great job warming the wipes. We have never delt with stinky or dry wipes and here is why.We are analy clean. We pour approximately 1 whole cup of bottled water into the container either before or after putting the wipes in. They absorb the water and stay warm and wet.We also buy the special anti-germ pads for the bottom. We change the bottom anti-germ pad every 3 months and there is no smell or dry wipes. So if you use the pads and more clean water than it calls for you should be very happy.
+1	Like many other users, I also have problems with the lid, it just never closes.  I have to use a paper weight just to close the lid.Other than that, I've had no problems with it.  I use Huggies wipes and it dispenses well from the Prince Lionheart Wipe Warmer.  I have to add a couple ounces of water into the unit once a week to keep the wipes moist.I like the little light that comes on to let me know that the warm function is on.My baby doesn't really care whether her wipes are warm or cold.  But it did make difference when she was a newborn and we had to do diaper changes throughout the night.  We noticed the regular cold wipes jittered her.  The last thing we wanted was for her to be more alert from her half-asleep state.  So I plugged in the wipes warmer and it helped!  By the time we were done changing her she was almost alseep again.  Once she got her milk, she was definitely out.So I would say I got this wipe warmer more for us than for the baby.It's been 8 months since we owned ours and we're still using it ... with the paper weight on top of the lid, of course.
-1	This is a horrible product!!!!  The pad burned to the bottom, and the wipes didn't stay warm long after leaving the warmer.  What's the point?  Terrible.
+1	Each time i open and have a warm wipe in between my hands, i feel better and glad or this purchase. Before having it, my daugther was shaking when i cleaned her with a cold one. Now, we r enjoying to change diapers
+1	Seemed like something silly but I am happy I have it. The warmth of the cloths feels good on the baby's butt and I sometimes use it to wipe other parts of his body too and he loves it, specially because it's the winter.
+1	This warmer is so awsome we bought a second one for our basement because that's were we spend most of our time.  It's true that our son loves warm wipes, when we use the cold ones he usually is very startled and throws his arms out, he also is more likely to pee during a change, which isn't fun either.  We use huggies wipes and don't mind opening the whole lid (it's not difficult) and water doesn't go out like some other parents comented, but the water does go back down to the bottom, which is nice.  Otherwise you have to add additional water.  We just resoak the pad once a week to keep from having brown wipes, and we haven't had one at all.  We will be purchasing the travel warmer because we travel to the inlaws frequently.
+1	I always hated the way a newborn shudders when you use a cold wipe on their little bottom.  Wipe warmer to the rescue.  I purchased this three years ago for my daughter and are now using it with my newborn.  Although it is not a necessity, it certainly is a luxury.  My 3 month old definitely knows the difference when I use a cold wipe away from home.  It is important to check the pad frequently and keep it moist to avoid drying out the wipes.  Other than that, it is a great product.  You don't know what you are missing until you use it and then you won't want to do without it.
+1	We got this wipe warmer from my aunt for a shower gift. We had a different warmer on our registry. I read all the reviews for this warmer and returned the one we wanted originally. I couldn't be happier with this warmer. Yes, water does gather on the lid, but runs down the inside of the warmer, thus rewetting the pad in the bottom of the warmer that keeps the wipes from drying out. Zac doesn't get a surprise with a cold wipe and we don't get a surprise from, well, those surprises boys &quot;spring&quot;  on you! This is a must have and I recommeded it to many expectant mothers I know!
+1	Have been using 20 months now and still loving it. Keeps wipes moist and soft. The sponge will turn brownish is u don't keep water In there as I believe it burns slightly but it can be cleaned. We are very pleased.
+1	I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old... She really love it !!...It's was very difficult make her to sleep... but the first day that we bought this I turn on the toy on her crib, and when the toy turn off I came to the crib and she was REALLY sleeping....I recommend to use this just one time a day, and when your daughter (son) is sleepy...but if you use it more than 1 time a day, BELIEVE ME, she or he will get tired of it quickly.  The only reason that I didn't put the 5 stars is because the images have poor quality, and now that my daughter is 7 1/2 months, she doesnt like it that much!!
+1	The songs and stories are so sweet, especially the "What Does the World Look Like" story. As soon as I heard that I knew I had made a good purchase. My daughter no longer sleeps in a crib, but I keep this on a shelf in her room and she turns it on whenever she passes it. I would recommend it to anyone.
+1	I was having a huge problem getting my son to sleep in his own room.  However, when I put the Dreamscape Soother in his crib he would fall right to sleep.  Now he sleeps in there all night every night.  This product also has a night light and a volume control button which are two excellent items to have at night.  Great product!!!
+1	We had been letting my son fall asleep with us in a family bed, but after a year of this... my husband and I decided it was time to at least let him go to bed earlier than we did so that we could have some alone time.  Putting him down in his crib (in our room) didn't work... he'd cry and cry.  Enter the Leap Frog Dreamscapes Soother.  After about two nights, he stopped crying when being put in his crib... because he was looking forward to the "Goodnight Toes" story.  I only wish we had bought this sooner.  Thanks Leap Frog!
-1	I was given this toy at my baby shower by a relative with young children.  I assumed her kids liked this toy and that's why she'd given us one (I hadn't requested it on our registry).  Unfortunately, our baby has never been interested in this toy.  I'm rather surprised because her Leap Frog Learning Seat is one of her absolute favorite things.  However, I can understand why she's not interested in the Dreamscapes Soother.  Personally, I don't find that there's much to look at - the flat lighted pictures that spin around are nothing compared to the three-dimensional, moving fish and real bubbles in the Ocean Wonders Aquarium (my daughter's very favorite crib toy).  Moreover, the sound of the pictures moving is VERY loud.  When we first used this toy (at night), my husband and I wondered if it was broken - that's how loud and grating the sound was.  We figured out, however, that it's simply the noise of the pictures turning.  Unfortunately, to cover up that horrible noise, we found we had to turn the volume up way too loud for sleeping purposes.  Overall, I wish I'd kept the box because I am so dissatisfied with this toy that I would return it if I could.
+1	This item is absolutely wonderful!!!  My daughter is now 8 weeks old and we have been using this in her crib since birth.  I can lay her down in her crib when she is on the verge of falling asleep and I turn on the "what does the world look like" story and she falls asleep before it is finished.  She loves the Twinkle Twinkle little star song and we often play it while I am changing her.  I highly recommend this to every parent! It does use up a lot of batteries so keep extra on hand, but it is worth it!!!

+1	Wonderful, lightweight solution to the bulky travel system. Lets sleeping babies STAY asleep! So easy to snap in and out, and folds for storage. Huge basket, and the cup holder is a nice touch. Very durable and easy to manuever. Great price, highly recommend. Perfect for the first 6 months.
+1	I made the mistake of thinking I didn't need this when my son was born.  After lugging my stroller around twice after my c-section, (great Graco stroller but heavier with infant car seat), I learned I needed to start out slowly.  This Snap 'N Go allowed me to take little strolls without straining myself after my surgery.  My son is 3.5 moz now and I am still using it.  I will continue to use it until he grows out of his Infant Car Seat.  The basket underneath is fantastic.  I have done a moderate grocery shopping with it and some of the bars which hold the infant car seat can accomodate a few more light items by hooking the shopping bags on, though I'm sure it is not recommended that you load up the front for fear it may tip over.
+1	When we found out we were having triplets, we like all other multiple parents bought a stroller to accommodate all the babies. The stroller is so large that we can not even fit it into a mini van. We have to purchase a large SUV or Full size van to go anywhere.We bought the Latch Lock carriers from baby trend and we just love them. When we saw the stroller that went along with them. We decided to order the Double Snap N Go.The stroller comes all put together, you just need to snap on the wheels. Then comes the fun part. The stroller is made for many different brands of carriers. You find the carrier you are using in the instruction manual and then you remove bars or rearrange them to fit your carrier. It is very simple and all the parts are well labeled.The carriers just snap on to the top, just like when you snap them into the base that is in the car. There is a strap that goes over the lower half of the carrier to prevent it from rocking or coming off the stroller. It is great because you do not have to unsnap your baby from the car seat and them snap them into the stroller. No need to transfer toys and blankets from car seat to stroller. What a time saver.It is very light weight and easy to set up. I pull it out of the trunk and just snap and lock it into place. I then just snap the carriers in place and we are off. It takes up the same amount of room that a normal single travel system would take up.For all you shoppers out there. I took the stroller into a women's clothing store and was able to easily navigate the store. The stroller handles very well. The front wheels are adjustable. You can set them for straight ahead or let them rotate.Because we have 3 babies, we easily become a tourist attraction. The stroller handles so well that I was able to move swiftly and accurately through spectators and display racks.We love the Double Snap N Go so much that we have asked for the Single Snap N Go for our Baby Shower.
+1	I went to Babies R Us convinced I would purchase the Graco stroller frame to go along with the Graco car seat I had.  Same manufacturer...should work, right?  Wrong.  Two other shoppers at the store had the same problem...the Graco frame just doesn't open easily.  BabyTrend's frame is lightweight, easy to put together, and a breeze to open and close.  And best of all, it is cheaper, which is a bargain considering you'll only use the frame until the baby can sit up (~6 mo.).  After that your baby will want to sit up and look out at the world.
+1	This stroller frame is easy to use, light, folds nicely, has a big storage basket and navigates well.  I highly recommend getting this to use with your infant carrier vs. a travel system.
+1	One of my favorite gifts I got at my showers! Its light, handles extremely well, inexpensive and can be reused again and again with different car seats. Highly recommend it!
+1	It is so helpful that I can just take the infant carrier out of the car and snap it on without exposing my daughter to the cold. Folds easily and takes up very little space in my trunk.
+1	I actually *am* one of those moms who bought a fancy travel system, but I ended up sticking it in the closet and using this stroller most of the time!  It is SO much more convenient.  Initially, I bought the Snap 'n Go just for travel (to accomodate the car seat provided by the rental car company), but I loved it so much I kept using it at home.  I can grab it out of my trunk and it literally falls open ready to go (don't worry, there is a clip to keep it closed for when you need it!).  So incredibly easy.  Don't underestimate how much you will appreciate having:  a) cup holders that actually accomodate different sized containers, b) a tray area for your keys, cell phone, etc., c) a huge basket so you don't have to cram everything under the stroller, d) wide-set wheels so you won't constantly be kicking the stroller when walking, e) great turning / smooth rolling, f) a stroller you don't have to fiddle with for 10 minutes to get your carseat attached.  It really is a great product.  (Only downside....hard to find a solution for shading the sun.)  (Note...obviously this stroller has no "educational" value!  :)  But I'm being forced to provide a rating for all categories, so I'll just give it a 5 for everything.)
+1	I really hated to spend the money for a travel system!  It just did not make good sense to me.  I was not sure exactly what type of stroller I wanted and decided to wait until after I had baby and then decide!  Besides, there were irrestible sales on infant car seats too sweet to pass up!  I purchased my infant car seat and got the one I wanted.  Then found this little contraption!  LOVE IT!I was able to keep this in the back of my mini-van.  It folds flatter than a full stroller and is very light!  There is one latch on the side that keeps it locked together and this is an easy release.  1-2-3 it is out of the car, open, and ready for baby in the car seat.It has a strap that you can thread through the underside of the car seat for protection.  It is kind of a pain but once you get the strap adjusted to your seat it is not that bad and definately worth the extra effort in terms of safety.The basket is huge and accommodated my extra super jumbo backpack/diaper bag.  It will serve you very well for trips to the mall when you have many shopping bags.The wheels turn easily and swivel.  You can take this anywhere!The brake mechanism is easy and effective.If you already own an infant car seat in blue this will give you the look of a travel system!...without the price!When Luca outgrew his infant car seat I was able to purchase the perfect strollers for him!This is the perfect solution if you do not want to be committed to an entire system and are looking for the flexibility of being able to choose a different stroller down the road.
+1	This is a great stroller!  It is so light weight and makes turning in narrow store isles so easy.  One fold system makes it so nice to take out of trunk and out into trunk.  I am going to miss the stroller when she reaches the 20lb weight limit and I can't use it anymore.  I just love it!!!
+1	My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own.  However, we switched to Dr. Brown's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion, since I am nursing. We can't express how much we LOVE the Dr. Brown's bottles.  Our son's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion.  The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby.  Dr. Brown's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET!  We'll use them with our next baby and will recommend to them to ANYONE that will listen.
+1	We used Dr. Brown's bottles with our first daughter, and now will do so with our second as well.  Both kids are gassy babies, so these are especially great for us.  The wide-necks are great because there is much less spillage when you are putting formula/breast milk in them.  They are simple to put together, and it only takes a few extra seconds vs. a "regular" bottle.  The only downside I really know of is that there are more parts to clean, but that's not really a big deal, especially if you use the dishwasher.
+1	These bottles worked wonders for my son!  They are great for gassy and colicy babies!  And no matter what anyone says I have been using them for 16 months now and have never had a leak unless you don't pull the nipple in all the way, which any bottle will leak if you don't put the nipple in all the way.  Out of all the bottles I tried these are the best!  THEY ARE DEFINITELEY WORTH THE FEW EXTRA DOLLARS!
+1	We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old. He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time, which bought me time to do housework around him, etc.  You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there's always variety.  I'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl. I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $35 I spent. I wouldn't spend much more than that.
+1	My daughter began playing with this toy at about 6 weeks. I play with my daughter often and most of her toys provide her with entertainment for a good period of time, and for a little while this one did too. However she seemed to grow bored of it sooner than I thought she would. I would wind up changing the toys around in an effort to hold her attention and if that didn't work, she'd roll over and peruse the mat for a bit but that wouldn't last long because she would get frustrated. I'm not sure why there is a picture of a rabbit by the way..it almost seems like an after-thought. I gave it four stars because there were plenty of times where she genuinely enjoyed this playmat, but it is unfortunate that she grew bored fairly quickly and frankly, the rabbit is useless.
+1	Baby Einstein rocks!  This activity mat was the best baby gift I received.  From a few weeks old through about 6 months old, this was my baby's favorite toy.  In the beginning she's stare lovingly at the ladybug.  Then she discovered the star and she fell in love!  Once she discovered how to kick the mat to make the star play music, she was in heaven.  As soon as the music stopped, she would kick the mat again.  She would do this over and over again.  For months, the only way I could escape to take a shower was to put her on this mat.  When she got older, she loved playing with all of the hanging toys.  I got this as a gift, but if I had bought it, it would have been well worth the money!  I highly recommend this product.
+1	We received this and a gymini as shower gifts for our newborn.  After much deliberation, we returned the gymini and kept this one and were never disappointed.  It had a relatively short life in our household because our baby started rolling over at just 3 months, so he rapidly was able to get off the mat and into other things.  But, for the time he used it, he loved it.  He particularly loved staring at the blinking lights and listening to the music on top.  Some of the toys (like the picture) never got much use, but he loved to play with the birds.  Extra rings really come in handy to add other toys to the gym, and to make the ones that come with the gym hang low enough for baby to reach.
+1	I have a hard to entertain baby and this toy is great.  In the beginning the musical star startled him and we left it off.  He loved the mirror the best.  Now, at 4 months, the star is his all time favorite.  We have added pictures of smiling babies and cute animals to the picture holder and I change the picture everyday.  It helps to rearrange everything often.  He loves the teather ring.  We've also added some chimes (from another gym) that he thinks are great.  I don't know how long he'll be entertained by this now that he is crawling around some, but so far it's his favorite toy and allows me a good 20 minutes of free time - which for him is amazing!
+1	My daughter enjoyed this gym for several months, and it is now being enjoyed by a neighbor.  It comes with a pillow somewhat similar to a small Boppy.  It is great for tummy time.  I did not purchase this gym, it was a gift.  It is quite pricey for what it is.  Most babies I would think would be as happy with a less expensive alternative.
+1	Our son loves this play mat, and plays with it almost every day.  The toys that it comes with are fine, though I was glad I had extra rings to dangle them down further as they really were up to high. the picture of a rabbit is kind of a dumb "toy" he doesn't show any interest in it at all. The musical blinking star is fun and once he learned that he could start it by pulling a toy hard enough, he played it all the time.  One note, because the supports don't cross the way some others do, he has been able to hook his legs around a support and fold himself up inside the mat - it didn't hurt or even scare him, but it would be a risk if he'd been unsupervised.  Once he started sitting up, he still likes laying down and playing in it, as well as sitting on the mat and playing with the toys. We never used the prop pillow.
+1	My son loves this gym. He is eight weeks old and just starting to reach for the hanging toys. It is nice that you can add extra rings to the hanging toys to make them lower. I have laid him on the mat since he was about three weeks old and it is great for tummy time. We have hardwood floors and the padding is sufficient. He loves to watch the sun toy that plays music/flashes lights and especially loves the mirror. I like that the toys are detachable. When he was younger we would place the sun and the mirror on the mat next to him. We have also hung the toys from his bouncer chair toy bar. The mat is easy to fold up and fits nicely in his closet. A previous reviewer complained about the rabbit picture. I like that the "frame" of that picture is a pocket and I have replace the rabbit with a picture of daddy.The only bummer about this toy is that our cats love it and think it is their toy. I have to kick them out of it all of the time and have caught them batting at the toys more than a few times. The mat is big enough for the baby and one of the cats, but not all three at the same time!
+1	My 4 month old absolutely loves this play gym. She has been under it for about 2 months now and has a great time. It is her favorite activity. She also enjoys tummy time on the mat, where she loves to look at the large pictures. The only problem is that we use it so much that we go through batteries like there's no tomorrow.
+1	My daughter loves this gym!! She is always smiling and kicking her legs in excitement when I put her under the star. We call it "The Happy Star". She loves the star and the toys. She is always reaching up to grab them. It's machine washable and easy to fold in half. This is a great buy!
+1	My son is 14 weeks and has been playing on this mat since he was about 4 weeks old.  Now he can bat at the toys and he kicks the arches which makes the music and lights go on.  He gets so excited when he sees the lights and hears the music.  I hestitated about registering for this mat, but I'm so glad we got it.  It's his favorite toy!
+1	My daughter got this for her "shower" and she absolutely loved it.  She would lie mesmerized by the musical star and also loved playing with, reaching for, grabbing, and eventually even taking off all the things that hang from the various loops.  It's got great colors and shapes and overall is just terrific.  This is a great great item - one of the best we've found.At about 7-8 months, the thrill wore off.  Now she crawls over/through it and moves on.: )
+1	My son really enjoys spending time on his activity mat. The star on top with the lights and music were a big hit when he was only a few weeks old. His grandparents actually "stole" it and put it on his pack and play. Now that he's 5 months he can reach out and play with the hanging toys. The only negative was as a newborn I thought the the material was rough and scratchy. So, I always put a blanket down, to make it more comfortable . . . and warm. (he was a fall/winter baby)I wish I could find out if you can buy individual pieces for it. (more hanging toys and another star!) After reading one of the other reviews I realize that I really have nothing to compare it to, since this is the ONE we got. But, overall we are happy with it.
+1	My son was 4 month old when he received this as a Christmas gift.  He loved it. He loved the star best of all.  He would lay there and stare at it..when it stopped he would kick it again.  It was great to keep him occupied. I put the play mat away when he became more mobile.  At 11 months he plays with the star and the book.  The only negative thing is that my son used to chew on the book, and constantly has be cleaned.  I've actually had to hide teh book from him for a while
+1	I have to admit that when I turn on the star, my baby smiles and coos at it, but other than that, it's nothing special.  i was a little disappointed that only one of the hanging toys is a rattle... the other two are squeakers (it's not easy to make something spueak when the baby is just batting at it).  It was a gift... otherwise I would never have bought it.  I think you can probably find something just as nice for cheaper.
+1	We registered for this and received it as a shower gift.  My daughter loved the musical star from the moment I laid her on the mat.  Unfortunately, the motion sensor did not work.  I called the manufacturer, and they sent me a new one.  The customer service rep was very helpful.  The new star works great, and now that my daughter is almost 6 months old, she still loves it.  She does roll into the gym bars now that she is more mobile, but she still loves swatting at the toys.  She has discovered how to pull hard enough so extra links will come off into her hands, and seems to smile as if she's proud of herself. I can't compare this to other gyms, but so far this has served its purpose.  Once they start rolling all over, the size of the mat will not be significant.
+1	My now 8-week old loves to look at the star's flashing lights and she kicks her legs, smiling and and cooing like crazy while she watches it.  The downside is that there are only three melodies that the star plays (but they're definitely tolerable and not too loud), and when it is set on the continuous setting, it still stops after 2 1/2 cycles of the music.  That means that if baby is still interested, you have to keep resetting it manually every time it stops.She's not really interested in the other toys yet, but the mat itself provides a great place to practice tummy time.  I do agree that the mat isn't very large - her feet already hang past the edge when I lay her with her head under the star so I'm sure she'll outgrow this quickly.  However, for now, this is one of her favorite toys and a safe place to let her play while I do chores in the room.PS - The rabbit "picture" that a lot of reviewers commented was a waste is actually meant to be taken out and replaced with your own photo.  A great idea in my opinion, as babies love to look at pictures of faces and loved ones.
+1	My baby boy has never been into toys that dangle and rattle, so it has been tricky finding him things that would keep him interested to encourage exploration and learning. So when I got the Baby Einstein Play Gym from a friend, I was skeptical. But my baby boy loved it the first time I laid him on it. He especially liked the little star that displays lights as it plays music. I think that's the biggest thing that kept him really focused on this toy for a while. As for the duck, the bird, the other stuff hanging on this play mat, he did use them as punching bags which is pretty cute. Now that my boy lays on his tummy more and more, he's beginning to explore the images on the mat with gusto. I like this product and highly recommend it!
+1	At first, I wasn't sure that he needed a play gym.  Then I couldn't decide which one to buy because there was a huge range in price and what if he didn't like it.  I happened to be in Toys R Us with a gift card when this was on sale, so I decided why not?  I went home, immediately assembled it for him, and put him on the mat while activating the star at the top.  He saw it and smiled!This gym has a star which has lights and plays music.  There are about 4-5 songs that it plays and they are classical pieces.  We have constantly used this gym and the songs are not annoying at all.  You can set this on continuous mode or on motion mode which will activate the music and lights when the gym is moved a bit.It has a mirror, plastic book, duck and cardinal which squeak, ladybug rattle, and circular rattle.  Also, you can use the rings to adjust the height of each toy and placement.  We have also added some other toys that he likes and he can pull on.He gets so excited when playing with this toy by smiling, babbling and wildly moving his arms and legs.  I was shocked the first time I heard him activate the music, but now he does it quite often.  At 6 weeks, we had to play with him and now at 12 weeks, we can place him down on the mat and listen from a distance.The little pillow that comes with this is ok.  Our son used it at first, but liked to maneuver off of it and roll over.  Now, we don't use it at all, but you could use it to prop a baby up for some of that "tummy time".All-in-all, I feel that this was a good purchase because we have definately used this everyday and he has grown with it.  Plus, he really seems to enjoy playing in it from that very first smile to this morning's conversation with his dear duck.
+1	I registered for this playmat not sure if our baby was going to like it, but when I received it, I thought it was bright and cheerful and the right size for our already cluttered living room!  When our son was 4 weeks old, he started showing signs of interest in bright objects so we put him on the mat and were really surprised with the results - he absolutely LOVES the mat!He especially loves the musical star (that can be moved around with the velcro straps) and watches as it lights up in different areas!  Now he is almost 6 weeks and it has become a calming and interesting place to be when he gets fussy- he will lay on his back and gaze at the mirror, lights on the star, and kick the birds and watch them move!  This mat is a must for baby registries and great for newborns to gain alertness.Another reviewer did not like the rabbit card, but it comes in a sleeve that will hold a 4x6 photo, so we printed out a photo (of my husband's college mascot, because it is bright colored) and put it in the sleeve.  You could also put a photo of mommy or daddy, grandparents or a pet, too.  Also, you can add other toys to the rings when the baby gets bored with the birds/bug/rattle.UPDATE: Our son is 6.5 months old and STILL plays with the mat!  Now he is sitting up on his own and will sit for half an hour or more grabing the toys or rolling around on the mat (and even grabbing the tags under the mat!)  We also just found out that a neighbor with a son the same age has the same mat and loves it too!
+1	My daughter loved this gym from about 6 weeks until 4 months. The toys are bright and colourful and the mat and toys all wash well. My only complaint is that the ladybug rattle is quite difficult to use for a small baby and that there are not enough rings included to make the toys low enough for a small baby. Overall a great way to give your baby some activity.
+1	This bottle system looks very intimidating at first but is anything but that.  We started using them after we recieved 2 free 4oz ones at the baby faire.  My daughter responds very very well to them and hardly spits up.  She still does but the reduction is amazing.  Once you work out a cleaning system they are a breeze to clean.  The disk that goes between the vent and the nipple makes it wonderful for travel and preventing formula clumps from clogging the nipple something I have noticed with Similac formula.  I am just ashamed I didn't listen to my fiancee's demands.  He used the regular ones for his son from a previous marriage and insisted by them.  If you are pregnant and going through the great bottle debate these are the ones to buy hands down.  You will kick yourself if you don't.  I know I did.
+1	This bottle is by far the best bottle I have ever used. I've bought the long skinny Dr Brown's bottles but much prefer the wide neck. One of the advantages for me, these are so much easier to clean than the others. I used the regular Gerber bottles with my first, Advent with my second and tried Advent & Soothie brand with my 3rd with no success. My 3rd has bad gas & reflux, she also wasn't digesting her food properly our doctor suggested Dr Brown's and I was hesitant at first simply because I did not want to wash all those extra parts. C'mon having 3 kids who has time for dishes. I decided to go ahead and quit being stingy on my part and get them for my daughter, what a lifesaver! These bottles were terrific, along with a hypo-allergenic formula and these bottles she could actually eat without screaming in pain & sleep like a peaceful baby. I would recommend Dr Brown's to anyone and after awhile washing the bottles/extra parts becomes second nature and really isn't so bad when your babies are happy & healthy.
+1	We stared my son on a bottle of breast milk at 15 days old.  He had no problem switching between the wide neck bottle and the breast.  Now my husband can feed him when he gets home from work.  So far, my son hasn't experienced any gas or spitup.  As for the extra effort to clean the parts, it only takes about a minute longer so it's really no big deal to me.  I'd recommend these to anyone who is breastfeeding and wants to introduce a bottle in addition to the breast.UPDATE:  Got sick of washing all those parts!  I felt it was worth it in the beginning to make sure my son didn't get collicky.  But once that passed, I quickly switched to the Playtex drop-ins.
+1	Our baby improve reduce the fussy since we switch to this bottles! Meanwhile, I am so surprise that this company price is much cheaper than in the shop! Good price, Good bottles!
+1	A lot of parts to clean each time, but I found that my baby does have less gas after using Dr. Brown's than after using other brands.  One question for the manufacturer--is any woman's nipple shaped like the way manufacturers shape bottle nipples???
+1	My son has had acid reflux since he was a few days old, and after dealing with 2 months of severe spitting up I finally saw an ad in a magazine and bought these bottles.  What a lifesaver they have been!  Within days, he was spitting up less and had less gas too.  It was such a noticeable difference that it had to be the bottles.  I could tell using Dr. Brown's that my son wasn't taking in as much air as he was with the Avent bottles we had been using.  I do suggest, however, that you read carefully and follow the directions included with these bottles.  For example, if you are going to put them in a bottle warmer, you MUST take the nipple off first or the liquid becomes piping hot and even explodes through the top.  Other than that, they are very easy to care for.  I thought cleaning them was no more difficult than any other bottles...the extra steps are worth it to me.
+1	I wrote a review the other day as i was ordering more of the 8oz standard dr browns bottles and advised how wonderful i thought those were. i did not know there were wide neck versions of dr browns until i saw them online that day. i decided not to order them at that time because there were some bad reviews about the nipple and leaking, etc.  well i really liked the design of the wide neck bottle and decided to try them anyway a few days later. i am glad i did, i am so happy with them that i exchanged the 8 oz standard bottles for 8 oz wide neck bottles. my baby has an easier time with this nipple and is finishing more formula faster than with the standard size. the wider nipple base keeps her from putting the whole thing in her mouth and she is spilling less out the sides of her mouth. the wide neck bottles fit in the diaper bag better and its easier to pour formula into them. i have not had any problems with leaks (read the directions that come with the bottles). i recommend both styles of dr browns bottles as they truly do eliminate the gas and colic, you just have to try both styles to see which nipple works best for your baby. i used the standard ones for 2 months and cannot complain, but i do like the wide ones better now having tried them.
+1	I love all the Dr. Brown's bottles. My son has never had any problems with colic, excessive spit up or gas. I attribute this to these bottles. He was even great on these when switching between bottle and breast - no problems. When I had to use other bottles in a pinch, he wasn't happy eating.Our microwave is too small to warm the standard 8 ounce in. The wide neck, 8 ounce bottles are perfect. They achieve exactly what I need them to in all areas.The only cons about Dr. Brown's bottles are that our son has a hard time feeding from any other bottle. This bottle is so effective that on the occasions he has used different bottles, he didn't know to let go to let air fill up the bottom of the bottle. It was frustrating, and we had to keep breaking the seal in his mouth for him. If you're going to use Dr. Brown's, stick to these bottles only. Also, the nipple on the wide neck is different from standard, and it takes baby a few feedings with the new nipple to get used to it. Additionally, if any of the Dr. Brown's bottles are not assembled correctly and the collar isn't on tight enough they will leak. There are additional parts that need to be cleaned, but its well worth it!I'd never buy another brand!
+1	I am on baby boy #2 and I wish I had these from day one with #1. No more balled up babies clinching anything due to tummie pain. Worth the money!!! Avent, Evenflo, Gerber, Playtex all have nothing going for them... Go ahead pay for something that actually does what it claims and throw the gas drops out the door!!! You will be amazed at the change in your little one... The word colic wouldn't exist if everyone used these!We are a one income family &amp; money is tight but this makes for a happier mommie and daddy when baby is not in pain and sleeps better! Just buy three like we did and clean and rotate them out. We keep a bowl by the sink and clean all the parts.. Bought a Avent microwave sterilizer off of ebay we sterilize the parts. It's so worth the extra time... Think about your worse gas pains... your poor baby is suffering cause you can't save a buck here and there and get the good bottles...ask grandma...:-)
+1	I bought this bottles for my newborn daugther, and at first we were amaze because she never had colic or gas (just minimun). But now, 3 months later, she still doesnt have any gas or colic, so its the same if she drinks from dr brown or avent. So now I change to avent, because they are easier to clean, bigger, the caps are better and all the avent products grow with your baby, so now I am an extrictly avent mom.
+1	I have three children, a 4.5 year old, a 2 year old, and a 5 month old.With my older children any bottle worked, so naturally we went with cheaper bottles. But my 3rd child was born prematurly, and wasnt getting enough formula. He was constantly sucking (not enough income) and would become tired. I wound up having to soley breastfeed, and he wouldnt take the breastmilk from a bottle! He also spit up, and was a very uncomfortable baby, and would cry constantly.I decided to switch to the "high maitanance", bottles... and of course they worked! The one thing I dont like is when people do not read directions, and they write a bad review for a product that doesnt deserve it. I know that every product will have bad reviews (maybe dud bottles?) but if you read the instructions, and use the bottle correctly, it will satisfy you. So right away if you dont want a "high maitancance" bottle, than do not buy these.They take about 30 seconds longer to make a bottle. First I mix formula, or breastmilk in another bottle (like a plain Gerber bottle that I plan to use later on when hes older). You CANNOT shake this bottle while liquid is inside, or it will leak. Then I simply pour it into the D.B (Dr. Brown) and attatch the parts... My baby is able to drink a bottle faster, easier, and afterwards is much more relaxed (although he still does burp, and get a bit gassy). I found cleaning them after each use was a must if possible. If I was out for the day, and my baby finishes the bottle I will wash it when I get home. I simply wash it like any other bottle, with hot water, and antibacterial soap. I use the brush provided for the vent, and I also put them in the dishwasher. And then occasionally they get thrown into my sterelizer.The bottles happen to be great in diaperbags, and they dont leak if they are put together correctly. I am now trying to wean my baby off D.B's and onto the Gerber Comfortholds, and the regular Gerbers, just because (1) he will be drinking more than just milk, and (2) because the Gerbers ARE easier.All in all if you have a baby with eating/nursing problems, purchase the Dr.Browns. If your baby is "fine", I would highly reccomend another, easier, brand.
-1	I spent around $50 on a set of these bottles only to find they made her gas worse.  The nipples is big and hard(she was breastfed for the first three months and only took the bottle sometimes at first, now she is on all bottles). I think air was getting in around her mouth b/c milk was always leaking out of her mouth too.  Next......they are a MAJOR pain to clean even with a dishwasher.  I started using playtex nursers during the hurricane because we had no power to run the dishwasher to wash those awful things and found that the nipple is soft, smaller,  more like the breast, they don't leak like Avents if you use a playtex drop in, easy to clean and most important, her gas problem was greatly reduced.  The downside is the cost of the liners. I would buy these bottles as a last resort if all others have failed to help your child's colic problem
+1	Boy, is this stuff great!  I can't use the oatmeal wash on my child because it broke his skin out in a rash and burned.  But the rest of their products are wonderful.  I particularly like the berry wash but they're all just great.  I bought some of the Baby Magic and spilled some on our dark blue carpet.  Believe it or not, it bleached the rug!  Now, just how gentle is THAT!  That's why I'm sticking to Gerber.
+1	I really liked this because you have a variety of baby washes to choose from. I personally like the lavender, since my daughter takes her baths in the evening. The washclothes could be bigger, so i just stick to a mitt or sponge. The CD is fun to play and sing along to,just make sure you dont play the same ones everytime, itll stick in your head!
+1	I think Gerber has the best skin care line.  My son had excema when he was an infant and the Gerber is the most moisturizing for his skin.  This is a great gift set which includes all their great scents.  I would highly recommend this over Baby Magic and Playtex anyday.
+1	I love the Gerber line of baby washes, shampoos, and lotions.  They smell so much better than the Johnson & Johnson or Baby Magic products.  The Gerber lotion works so well that I use it on my hands as well as on my baby's entire body.  The scents are soft and sweet, not too fragrant or overpowering.  The products are also gentle, and the baby wash and shampoo do not irritate my baby's eyes.  Of all of the baby bathing products that I have tried during the last year, these are definitely my favorite.
+1	If you need a shower gift this is it! I got one and I love it...the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing! Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.I keep all of the "out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~!The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff...also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be!!
+1	We love this whole kit. It has everything. When my son takes night time baths we use the lavender soap and boy is he ready for bed when we get him out. The carry case is also a great. We take it on trips with us and we carry his basic shampoo that came with the kit, toys, towels, washcloths and such and there is still room for more!!! The lotion is great and very thick which helps keep babies skin ever so soft after bath time, and the moisturizing stick is fantastic for getting a dry patch here and there. We keep it in the diaper bag. Great set for any parent, a must have for first time parents.update: my son is now 9.5 mths old and we have yet to even finish  our second bottle of wash. Everything except the lotion and 1.5 bottles of baby wash we still have plenty of. This gift set is fantastic, talk about the gift that keeps giving. At this rate we will not need to buy shampoo/body wash until after his first birthday!!
+1	What's great about this product is that you can adjust it to anyone's needs. My husband is 6'4 and big and he can make this work for him to take "piggy" out for a walk. With just a simple adustment to the strap I can change it to wrap her around me. The best is that as a new born (before one can master the art of concealing breast feeding), you can use this to hold and feed your little one.
-1	I NEVER REALLY COULD GET COMFORTABLE WITH THIS THIS SLING.  I THINK MY DAUGHTER IS TOO SMALL.  WITH ALL THE FABRIC IT JUST SEEMS AWKWARD.  MUCH PREFER THE FRONT CARRIER.
+1	We got this when my daughter was an infant, to supplement the baby bjorn active. Both are absolutely fantastic.  This sling is easy to find (here online and also in the stores) it's inexpensive, and most importantly - safe.When my daughter was a "newborn" I used this all the time and we loved it!  As she grew, we used the Baby Bjorn lots more b/c it gave me my hands free and kept her well balanced and supported.  Now, she is 9 1/2 months old now and we are using this again.  I cannot say that this is better or worse than other slings b/c it's the only one I've used, but I really do love it.  It's not the fanciest, prettiest, or hippest - but it works!Also, since it's Dr. Sear's endorsed product, I trusted the name.  It came with a video and an instructional pamphlet, both of which were really helpful to us in learning how to use the sling and giving us security to know we were "doing it right."Two thumbs way up!
-1	I bought this sling because my son would not sleep unless I was holding him. I work from home on the computer and I needed both hands to work, so i thought this would help. It did, as long as I was sitting down. It was very difficult to walk around with especially since my son was heavier than most babies his age. This sling is okay, but i really didn't use it much because it hurt my back. I ended up using my front carrier more, it supported my back better and still served the purpose of making my son feel secure. I would not recommend this product unless your baby is not heavy and you have a strong back.
+1	This sling was absolutely terrific, especially when my son was a newborn to about 5 months.  I also have a Baby Bjorn, but that was better for later on.  At first, the Nojo is excellent because the baby doesn't have to be upright and you don't have to worry about the head floppiness.We had actually purchased another, more expensive sling but it had more of a "bucket" for the baby to go into and my son hated it! With the Nojo, you really can adjust everything - where you put them, how you put it on, how high or low you wear it, etc.There are two excellent uses that I found for the sling, but DIDN'T like the Baby Bjorn for:1) At night when the baby is very young (up to about 4 months), you can "wear the baby down" in the sling by walking around till the baby falls asleep.  It's a great way to calm/ quiet and get the baby to sleep.  It used to work when even rocking wouldn't work.2) You can literally do the dishes, laundry, even have a snack while wearing the sling.  This was somehow a lot harder for me with the Bjorn because I kept bumping the baby.Don't get me wrong, I love the Bjorn too and find it much better for walks.  But around the home, the sling was always the carrier I would turn to.  It's just so easy to throw on, throw the baby into - not a lot of straps and so on to deal with.Outstanding purchase for yourself or a shower gift!!!
+1	Although this does take a little getting use to, this is a great sling.  I have used it with 2 babies from birth up to toddlerhood.  I love how it holds your newborn closer than regular front carriers.  Both of my daughters would instantly fall asleep.  I also like that it can be used to nurse discreetly. Some have complained about too much material and it being too long, but with a little adjusting and patience, it should fit any caregiver.  I used it on my toddler right up until my new daughter was born.  A great and affordable sling.  And Dr Sears is the expert!!!
+1	These are great in the bath.  They float, stick and are great for my 8 mo old to suck on (his favorite hobby these days).  My only complaint is that there is only 1 of each letter (I should have paid closer attention to the number of pieces when ordering).  Not a huge deal, but we can't spell my son's name out, (we need 2 R's).  Oh well, they do their job otherwise.
+1	My 13 month old son LOVES his bath letter and numbers. He loves them so much that he wants to carry them around the house chewing on them.  And the best part is they are VERY durable!  He has 16 teeth already and doesn't rip them to shreds like other things he chews on.  We had to order a second set of these because we had some plumbing issues and these got ruined.  He's getting his second set for Christmas! :o)
+1	The first time we used these we tried to spell out our sons name only to realize there is only 1 of each letter.  Makes spelling things tough.  They stick to the tub well and the bright colors are great for our son.
-1	I bought these because they were only cup that my toddler would drink out of but after washing them one time they leak like crazy. Unfortunately I had already bought 8 of them. They are supposed to have an arrow on the top that lines up with the bottom to prevent leaking but it doesn't work. These are horrible.
+1	Very good, I hope my daughter loves, my daughter is too young, still use it not very good, I was prepared for her
-1	This is a piece of clear plexiglass that is the length of you dvd player and is angled at 90 degrees, so that you attach velcro (included) to the top of the dvd player and then to the plexiglass and the other part of the clear guard actually protects the buttons. It says that if your dvd player is too short to use the longer side, reverse it and use the longer side of the guard on the player and the shorter side to cover the buttons. I understand, but it was still too big. I have a Sony DVD player that is 1.5 inches high and the short side of the guard is 2.25 inches high. So since the guard would not lay flat, there is no way this would keep my son from getting into the dvd player. I thought about putting a book under the player, but I think he would just lift it and get into it.If your dvd player is less than 2.25 inches high, this will not work for you.
-1	I'm not sure why I thought this would be any different than it turned out to be, but it's just a piece of plastic. And it covers the place where the DVD slides in and out of the player. Baby wasn't more than 1.5 (probably less) and quickly figured out how to move the DVD player so that she could still push all the buttons. This product was not the solution. The solution was to put that DVD player out of reach. Why didn't I think of that first??
+1	I am very pleased with this product. It doesn't change the integrity of the electronic equipment. Little fingers are no longer able to touch the buttons on the cable box. I highly recommend this to those families with "happy pointer fingers".
+1	I got these since I'm making my own baby food for my son. They're great storage containers, dishwasher safe, plus attractive in color. They also make for nice bowls for mixing food and feeding (for baby portions that is).
+1	I really like these bowls for home-made baby food. I've bought them several times, and they last an acceptable amount of time, even going through the microwave and dishwasher. In fact, the reason we have to keep buying more is that with our two kids, we get ditzy and forget them places!!!I also use these for toddler snack food in the diaper bag or car, holding pre-measured formula for bottles, and for playing with playdough.As you can see, there are many kid-friendly uses for them...But wait, there's more:This is a great size container for multiple uses in the kitchen as well. I can make a small batch of cinnamon sugar and store it covered in my cupboard. Leftover vegetables or fruit salad fit perfectly in here and the lids are airtight to keep them fresh! I use it to mix cornstarch and water to thicken. And so much more. These are great containers!!
+1	i love them. they are small enough to pack in a  diaper bag without taking a ridiculous amount of space.
+1	I love these, they're easy, light, and I don't feel guilty throwing them away if they get yucky. Totally worth it.
+1	I bought these when I started my son on solid food so that I could store and feed out of the same bowl and it does just that.  Works perfectly for what I need them for.
+1	It's light and seals tight. My wife puts in a few scoopfuls of rice cereal when we have to go out with the baby and everything stays inside. And being light is important too because that diaper bag gets heavy very quickly. And because it's pretty cheap, we don't mind if it gets squished or we have to throw one away (we haven't yet. Just shows how good the bowls are). We love that it goes in the dishwasher & the freezer.
+1	I love these bowls. I use them to freeze baby puree food, to store and transfer food to daycare, when we are out and about etc. I use them every day. They work great!
+1	We got these to hold our daughter's treats when we decided we were going through too many plastic ziploc bags.  They were much better than a plastic sandwich bag in terms of durability and life cycle.  However, we still found that we ran into the same problem of the snacks being knocked out (or dumped out) when out and about.  For taking snacks on the go, we found that theMunchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Varyworked better for our needs, especially when it comes to preventing spills.  The downside to those is that they aren't air-tight so the food can go stale.So, you really have to determine what you are buying this for.  If you are getting it to prevent spills, there are a lot better options out there.  If you are simply looking to replace ziploc bags with something more durable and eco-friendly that will still keep the snacks from going stale, then this is a great product.
+1	We use these bowls all the time! They stack great in a refrigerator or cooler. They don't have the worlds best seal (so don't put anything liquid) but they are perfect for baby food or finger foods.
+1	Decent product for the price. I do notice the lids seem to lose their shape after they go through the diswasher a few times-they still work, it just takes a little extra effort to secure them to the bowl. Overall I'm pleased with the product.
+1	Great set of bowls at a good price point. They are the perfect size for my 9-month-old and I think they will last a while. I do kind of wish they were slightly thicker/heavier, but they are still very sturdy and convenient.
+1	Good price. Works in dishwasher, no spills with lid. I don't know why you can't pick the colors, but we lucked out with our colors.
-1	I loved the bright colors . The container is of a decent size perfect for kids but the lids don't fit well.
+1	I have used First years take and toss sippers and bowls since the birth of my nieces. Now I am using them for my son and they do not disappoint. I have absolutely no complains about it. Great product great price.
+1	I have been using these bowls for a few days and so far, they are perfect for baby's little portions. What I like most is that they stack very well on top of each other, both bowls and lids together, saving space. I recently re ordered some more.
+1	Great cups, last a while and last through many dishwasher runs.  However, it's so strange that the tops come in colors that are different from the cups.  When you have a picky toddler who simply MUST have the green cup with the green top, that makes life tough as you try to explain there simply is no green top.
+1	These cups are very cheap and work good. After my 20 mon son chew up so many soft spout sippy cups, I decide use this one. It works great, no leak and last longer, but spout also soft enough for him to bite down. Wish it come with more cap than just one.
+1	So I am a huge researcher in products for babies and toddlers that are organic or BPA, free.  My son is VERY picky and I had a very hard time convincing him to drink out of a sippy cup.  I literally tried about 4-5 different brands and shapes.  He was just not having it.  The day i tried this particular cup (sippy not straw version) he used it!Now, most kids are not this picky and would probably drink out of anything.  I like this product also because it is 1) BPA free, 2) LOW PRICE 3) You can sometimes find cute versions of this cup with Disney Cars on it or Toy story etc.  You can also lose or forget these sippy cups and not feel bad because of how incredibly cheap they are.  I have bought this product least 10 times over the last year and a half and that is only because I can't stand when my son starts to chew and leave teeth marks on the lid.
+1	These are great for traveling or just using around the house! They are pretty durable but don't have a stopper so they leak if left tipped over. But they are cheap and easy to throw away if needed!
+1	Our 1 year old loves these cups.  They are durable and love the price!  Only 4 stars, b/c the lids do pop of when kids throw them on the floor.  And after chewing and hitting the floor, they do leak.  These are NOT leak proof, just spill proof.  This is the only cup we buy, because we do not want those rubber top cups that our 1 year old can bite the top off...  We Recommend, but understand they will slowly drip when turned upside down after much use.
+1	After searching and buying many many sippy cups to find the perfect sippy cup i finally decided to buy these. They work perfect for my 12 month old son. I always skipped over this product because of the low price, automatically made me think and the cups are cheap and do not work good. I wished i bought this cup MONTHS ago, it would have saved me so much money and trouble. This is the perfect sippy cup, does not spill or leak unless it is turned upside down but not to much. Easy to take with me wherever i have to go. The only thing is that i wish i can find more of the to go spout covers. But these cups are so cheap I have no problem buying more.
+1	I know these are designed to be disposable but we reuse these all the time.  the lid is not the most secure lid in the world so curious minds may be able to get it off but for the price I love them.
+1	I like these cups.  Sometimes my youngest (18 months) had trouble getting the liquid out when he was impatient, but they keep the liquid fairly well contained.  I like that there is a spout cover that you can use to keep the spout clean if you need to carry it around for a while.
+1	Great product great price!!
+1	Don't leak, easy to use, only sippy cup my son will use. You do need to make sure to put on lids securely or they can pop off.
+1	Easy to clean, secure when the lid is on. Great for travel. Flow is also great - my son loves to drink his milk from this sippy cup. Only complaint - not super easy to clean the holes unless you have a special cleaner, but I dont think too much - just put it in the dishwasher :)
+1	These are really great even though they do not protect from spills as well as some other brands. The reason I prefer these is because there is nothing left in the cup, unlike the other spill-proof cups which have a bulky seal on the inside. The bulky seal tends to trap liquid inside and my son gets frustrated when he can't get the last little bit out of the cup.These are also great for mixing medicine with juice. Since there is no liquid left in the cup, you know that your little one was able to get all the medication along with their drink.
-1	These are fine for meal time, but I would never put them in a diaper bag.  They will leak if turned upside down and the lids come off pretty easily.  If you don't push down all the way around the lid your child will get a chin and chest full of beverage, which really doesn't amuse them :)  We use these as back-up cups only.
+1	First off, this is not a cup for a parent with a child that throws cups or pulls lids off or flips cups upside down and shakes them on a regular basis. If you want one of those then you need to get a cup with a valve that's closer to a bottle. However if you need a cup that won't make a huge mess when knocked over then these are the right cups for you.These are nice cups for kids transitioning to regular cups or for older kids that are in situations where a regular cup would be inconvenient. I used these for years after my daughter had transitioned to a regular cup when we were in situations where a spilled drink would have been a disaster, such as for her cup beside her bed at night, the cup I put her juice in when she was sick and for trips in the car. They're cheap and they stack in the back of your cabinet so you can just pull them out when you need them.The cups are dishwasher safe, they do crack when chewed on but besides that they're fairly strong for something that is disposable.
+1	I've tried four different kinds of pads and these have worked the best by far. They are ultra thin and very absorbant. I have a heavy flow and the Johnson & Johnson and Avent ones are too thick (which prevent them from absorbing as much) and are incredibly small. They also fill up really fast, causing them to overflow and milk to go EVERYWHERE. The Gerber ones cover the entire nipple area and most of the breast (other pads hardly cover just the nipple area). However, I'd recommend the heavy flow ones rather than the medium flow-- they just don't work as well. Also, I really don't see how they can slip out of place if you are using the right bra size. I'd recommend the Lansinoh brad as well for the same reasons I'm recommending the Gerber ones.
-1	As a new mom with a VERY heavy milk flow, I have tried several different breast pads over the last few months.  Here is my overview of each:Johnsons baby nursing pads - 60 Ea: These are my FAVORITE pads for daytime use.  They will not hold as much as Ameda, so they aren't as reliable overnight.  However, they are very soft and comfortable against tender breasts, They also have a nice shape that is more discrete than other brands.  I also love that they are not packed in pairs or singles, just all lumped in the box together.  Yes, this means they are not as "sterile" as the other brands, but they aren't a haste to unpack each time you need a fresh pad, and you don't risk waking up baby with crinkly wrappers. They do have an adhesive to keep them secure in your bra.  Also, they are the only pad I know of with a nipple indentation, meaning they are a little less abusive to already sore nipples.Ameda 50 Count Noshow Premium Disposable Nursing Pads: These are the most absorbent pads I have found.  In fact, they are the only ones that keep me dry overnight.  However, they have no shape to them at all, and are extremely obvious if you wear a thin bra.  They have no adhesive, so they will move around in your bra.  Also, they are packaged in an extremely crinkly wrapper, so if my baby is asleep I have to take them in another room to open, so as not to wake up the baby (and he is a heavy sleeper!)The First Years - Lanolin Disposable Breast Pads 30 ct.: These are the best pads for early stages of nursing, when the lanolin will help soothe sore and cracked nipples.  They are very cool and comfortable on your nipples.  However, they do not hold quite as much as the Ameda.  I did find that these needed to be changed pretty often to avoid feeling damp.  Also, the edges of the pad are scratchy and can be a bit uncomfortable throughout the day.Lansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-pack: These are a good all-around pad.  They will hold a good bit, but not as much as the Ameda or J&J.;  They do have an adhesive strip that will help them stay in place in your bra, and are a very good value to use long term.  Be sure you get the "soft" version, as the older style is much more scratchy and uncomfortable.Evenflo Comfort Select Nursing Pad, 48 Count: These pads are very absorbent, but not very comfortable.  They have an itchy material inside that tends to stick to cracked nipples when removed.  They also are very obvious through thin bras.Gerber Breast Pads - Variety Pack 100 Count: WORTHLESS.  These pads do not absorb even a single let-down if you have a heavy flow.  They would instantly soak through and my shirt would be wet.  Also, they have no shape so they will bunch up and show through your bra and shirt.  They also have no adhesive, so they will move around.  Overall, completely worthless for a heavy milk flow.
+1	I like this pads cause they first cheap ,second they do there job very well.i have a lot of milk and it is hold a heavy flow.
+1	This pump is the best available in the store (haven't tried hospital grade pumps.) I first had the AVEDA hand held and returned that, followed by the Harmony and then another Pump In Style (in the bag) and the face plate kept popping off and it had lousy suction.  I wish I had just gotten this one to begin with.  The backpack is great.  I leave the pump where I use it (it has it's own case) and use the backpack for my diaper bag.  I get asked all the time where I got the bag.  The double pump is fast and easy.  I keep it on mid suction and mid speed and that's all I've ever needed to fill two bottles in about 15 minutes without discomfort.  My baby always drank from the Medela bottles/nipples without problems.  Get this pump! Also, if you have any problems Babies R Us will let you return the pumps so I'd advise purchasing there.
+1	I got my Traveler Pump after months of comparison shopping. I was going to get the shoulder bag option and then saw a friend's and the bag looks (sorry to say this) tacky (this was before the new Pump In Style Advanced). It looks like it's made out of weird synthetic or really cheap leather and has these brass buckles on it. Even though they are the exact same pump, I was glad I got the traveler because it doesn't look like you're toting a breast pump around. The bag is made out of a neoprene-type material and looks like it will be very easy to clean in the event of spills or everyday dirt/wear & tear. My husband said he doesn't even mind carrying it because of the looks.*update*However, I wished I would have waited a couple months to get the new 2004 version they released (when I wrote this and bought the pump in early Feb '04, most places did not have it yet). The shoulder bag is supposed to look better and both the traveler and the classic are going to have a new suction actions, "Natural Expression," which is supposed to release more milk more quickly and act more like the natural sucking of a baby. I would suggest reading reviews for that product and comparing. Personally, I wished I would have waited. I get an adequate amount of milk from the pump, but both my OB/GYN and the lactation consultant we were seeing said that you get quite a bit less milk from pumping versus nursing, and I wonder if I would be getting more with the new Medela pump. Just something you might want to check into.... And shop around for the best prices - there are some better deals out there from reputable companies. Happy nursing!
+1	I actually borrowed this pump from a friend after debating whether or not I needed one.  I was going to buy an inexpensive manual.  I would not have survived!  I woke up very very engorged on the fourth day and the pump saved me.  I was able to pump 8 ounces within 15 minutes.  If I have another baby, I would buy this pump.  It is worth every penny.A previous reviewer commented that you cannot buy replacement parts.  The Medela website sells all parts and the prices and shipping are reasonable.  Their customer service is excellent as well.  As a thank you for the person I borrowed from, I got all new pieces for her when I returned the pump (and she was again pregnant) for about $35.
-1	I don't like how sharp the edges on the plastic are. It makes for a less than pleasant experience while putting bottles in the device. I've had it for a few weeks and have only used it once. I prefer to just hand wash our bottles, pacifiers, accessories, and breast pump parts. It's a good idea but ehh, not a hit.
+1	Amazing!  Nice construction, perfect for Dr Brown caps, tops, and binkies too!  This is a simple dishwasher basket, not extras that just take up space. Plain and simple and best of all BIG!
+1	I bought these because they were one of the cheaper versions. However, these turned out to my favorite. I've had the ones in the purple box and another cheap box from the store. These are so soft and curve slightly to form a cup.
+1	These are the only ones I will use - absolutely.  I would pay twice the cost of these w/o a doubt!  They're the perfect size, thin, contoured, absorbant, and the lanolin is comfortable.  I would recommend these to every breastfeeding/pumping mom out there! I only wish they came in a larger quantity and were a part of the subscribe and save program.
+1	I have tried many pads before settling on these. I just ordered 2 packs. They are soft, the lanolin treatment does make a difference and they hold leaking quite well!
+1	The lanolin really does come off onto your nips and helps with soreness. They are worth more $$ than the regular ones.
+1	These nipples worked great for my preemie. He was struggling with the Level 1 nipples - milk would come out the sides of his mouth and he was choking a lot. The preemie nipples let the perfect amount of milk out so that he wasn't overwhelmed.
+1	I love Dr. Brown's. Dr. B's bottles really help my baby from getting gas or spitting up. My newborn was still having a little trouble with bottles using the level 1 nipples due to the milk coming out too quickly. I switched to the preemie nipples and haven't had a single problem since.
