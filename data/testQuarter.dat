Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!
Helps me know exactly how my babies day has gone with my mother in law watching him while I go to work.  It also has a section for her to write notes and let me know anything she may need.  I couldn't be happier with this book.
I wanted an alternative to printing out daily log sheets for the nanny to fill out, and this has worked out great! I'm no longer searching my daughter's bag for a crumpled piece of paper each day. It's also nice to be able to look back on previous days and weeks for eating and sleeping patterns. I would have preferred a plastic-type cover, but it's held up well so far.
My 3 month old son spend half of his days with my mother and half with a neighbor while I worked.  I had them track his activity (loosely) in this which allowed me to get an idea of how his schedule was developing and how much milk he was eating.  It was the best way to have some cohesion in his life while I was at work.
The Baby Tracker brand books are the absolute best of the trackers that are available. You can track naps, feedings, diaper changes, activities, and notes. They're easy to use and have a nice clean layout.I started using the Newborn Baby Tracker, which tracks nights and days. It gave me a nice way to track feedings and note important milestones. Once I used up the entire book, I bought this Baby Tracker, which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now. Her caregiver notes her activities and sleeping times during the day. It's a great way for me to know what happened. Plus, it's nice to be able to look back and see patterns or trends.
I use this so that our babysitter (grandma) can keep track of what goes on during the day.  We've recorded so many milestones since we received this.  It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.  I'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book.
Has columns for all the info I need at a glance when I get home from work. Nanny is able to fill it out easily....love it
We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!
I've been using the baby tracker since the day my daughter came home from the hospital.  We're on the third one now.  It's useful for when the doctor asks how often she's feeding and urinating, but even better for looking at and realizing, &#34;Oh, she hasn't slept in x number of hours.  She's probably crying because she's tired.&#34;  But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule.  I flipped through a couple weeks and looked at when she seemed to be sleeping during the day and looked for a pattern, then started putting her down for naps around those same times each day.  It helps a lot.
I've been using this since the day my baby was born (1 month ago) and it is a life saver!  It is a great way to track when I breastfeed, what breast he ate from, how long, etc.  Plus when pee diapers are changed and poopy diapers.  Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day...so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all.  I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate, slept, or pottied.  I plan on ordering 3 more so I have enough to track this entire first year of his life!
I have used this book since my son was born.  It's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper.  Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor.  This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I'm gone.  They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I'm at work.  Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age.  I'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old.
I have used this tracker for all 3 of my children and swear by it! It is super easy to leave by the baby's changing table or crib and jot down things throughout the day (feedings, dirty diapers, nap times, etc). I also used it to jot down other important &#34;mile stone&#34; things that I would have quickly forgotten&#8230;like outings, temperature readings, visits from friends to meet him, calls to make, when we stopped swaddling him, etc. I was able to use it as a resource when (many months later!) I went back to formally fill out his baby album since I would have forgotten so many of those valuable little tidbits of information & memories.
GREAT journal. We use this everyday to communicate feeding, medicine and other needs when I don't have time to give my nanny the full rundown. LOVE it! I've bought two!
Great way to keep track of important daily activities/tasks when you are trying to get used to your new baby's routine.I include this as a gift to all of my friends now when they are having a baby.
THis has been helpful in tracking the feedings, diaper changes, naps and other developmental things for our little one but I REALLY wish they had laid it out so that you could leave it open and have the left side be AM and the right PM.  The way the pages are set up you have to flip a page to see a full day (starts with PM on the left and A.M. on the right).  It's a nitpick but if they had just let the user fill in AM or PM then the pages would be identical and you could look at a full day at a glance (with your hands full, holding a baby).  Sort of a pain to have to lean forward to pick it up and flip a page over just to see what happend prior.
if I didn't suck at documenting. Not sure exactly what made me think that I could keep up with recording every feeding, diapering, and sleep session. I was able to keep up with it for about 3 weeks...and then it fell by the wayside. I can really see how this would help with finding a schedule but I decided to let baby lead since we have a very flexible lifestyle.
My husband gave this to me as a Christmas gift as our baby was due in February. This is a great book to have during your first month of having a baby. With the restless nights and the nights blending together, it&#8217;s so easy to forget the last poopy diaper or what side and time you started feeding your little one. I used this book religiously for a month. After that, I just stored it into my newborn box. I will defiantly use it again for my next baby!
This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It's also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it's a great gift!
I find this tracker very useful. I've been using it for my now 3mo son. I keep it by my chair where I nurse him, so I can stay on top of jotting things down. It has helped figure out his sleeping and eating patterns - great!
Inside is nice and clean. Columns for diaper changes, amount feed, comments, etc. The time intervals are :30 minutes seems adequate, though sometimes I wish it was a bit more detailed. Also would have liked a ribbon or movable tab/page to keep track of what page in the log book we are at.  All in all, it does what is advertised and keeps us sane on what was done/changed when.
I used this for my little on and it was really nice for me as a new mom to have everything so well organized.  There was sufficient space for notes I didn't think, but all in all it was nice to have everything laid out.  If you're organized you could easily make one of these yourself and not spend the money, but when we had our baby I just needed one thing done for me and not have to do it myself and for that it was very helpful.
This is probably one of the greatest inventions. Before my baby was born, I purchased this and figured it's a nice-to-have item.I didn't realize until the first day home from the hospital how I would be RELYING on this simple, but easily organized log book. When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This book is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for the first 6 months. (I bought a second one after the 3 months one was done.)I used it to keep track of diaper changes and what kind (pee/poop), naps, and how long my baby nursed on each side. I also wrote notes for each day so I could see a history of reactions/milestones. It made it easier to figure out what gave my baby gas or why she slept better on certain days.Coupled with the Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Timer (which is also a necessity), I never really lost track (or my mind). It's also great for care-takers too, especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you! One of the most useful items yet.
Perfect way to keep track of the day for a little one-- this journal allows for detailed tracking of milk intake, diapers, sleep, and activity. Highly recommended as a perfect way to keep track and organize information in one easy to travel with place!
I did a lot of researching on what baby journal to buy and settled on this one and I did not regret it even for a second. This book is perfect! You can keep track of anything your baby does, from eating and sleeping and diapering to all the other things they do like first smile and first laugh. I only wish that instead of being 3 months it would be longer, like 6 months or even 1 year. I would definitely recommend for the first months of your baby's life.
My son's therapist brings this toy over and he just loves it.  He loves to move the ladder on the fire truck up and down.  This is one of his favorite toys and he doesn't play with a lot of baby and toddler toys (gets bored easy).
Both of my boys (1 and 2.5) love stacking and building.  They also love cars.  So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them.  They both love these cars!  All of the cars have a little &quot;surprise&quot; (the ladder on the firetruck &quot;clicks&quot; as it raises up and down, the siren on the police car spins, etc.) &amp; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older.  They're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest, bigger, biggest.
My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab.  The bright colourful colours really held her attention.  When she was sitting we played the &quot;Mummy stack them, Baby knock them down&quot; game and &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; with the smaller colours under the bigger cars.  They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on (especially the small green one) when she was teething.  At 2, she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over.  She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game!  Great for learning big and small, colours and numbers.  Good value!
I bought this last month for my 6 month old son, and it continues to fascinate him.  It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting. When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one!  He'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof. It will be a stacking toy later too! Great value for money...
This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.
For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.
I had a homemade quiet book when I was a kid and saw some on pinterest.  Since I don't know how to sew, I visited Etsy to see if I could buy one from that site.  I couldn't believe the prices!  I found this and ordered it for my three kids (9 mos, 2 years, and 3 years), and they all love it.  It's pricey, but it's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others.  Great book, and I love that all the pieces are attached!
I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it's an item that he can grow into and it's super cute!
I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future.
I got this quiet book for my 11 month old - for his 1st birthday coming up. He hasn't been able to play with it yet, but I was very happy going through it. I think he will have years of fun with this book. It provides several activities, which will help him practice skills he will be learning. It's also got bright colors and fun shapes that he is sure to enjoy. Can't wait to give it to him! Thanks.
This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.
My son loves this.  It took him a few tries to get the hang of it but its real simple for him to use.  When he bites it and it vibrates, he starts laughing and the tears disappear.
This was a favorite as soon as my son figured out that when he would bite it, it would vibrate. It either is really soothing or he just likes how it feels or something because hes 10mo old now and he still loves it...! Handle is great to put links around also to attach it to stroller or carseat!
my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.
It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.
My son loved this toy form the time he was teething until well after the time he got his teeth in. I plan on buying this for my daughter who is now 3 months even though she is not teething yet, she loves putting things in her mouth.
Great toy for teething! My daughter finds this very interesting especially when it gently vibrates and massages her gums. It didn't take her long to press down with her front teeth to activate the massaging action. She's enjoyed this just about everyday since we got it about 3 months ago. No issues with it! I sent one to a friend who just had her baby for when she starts teething.
thought would be a great idea for my almost 1 y/o...however, she really doesn't like it.  perhaps if i knew about it/introduced it to her when she was smaller she would be more apt to use it...she does like the rattle aspect of it and i vibrate her tummy, lol.  so it's not a complete waste
This is a great teether.  It is very easy for the little one to stimulate the vibrating action, making it a huge hit!
I like this product a lot, but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process... the product vibrates great, the colors are attractive to her, and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab. However, its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment. Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better. But overall I really like it.
Our son's occupational therapist recommended this for our aggressive teether. She thought he was using teething as a way to stimulate and calm himself. He liked playing with it more than he liked teething on it.
My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don't know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)
This toy was our go-to when my daughter was teething.  It really soothed her and calmed her down.  When her two year molars started coming in we got it back out for her and she still loved it.  We will definitely be buying another one for our next baby!
This works well to keep a baby busy. It's just too bad you can't change the battery. The battery hasn't run out yet though. I did buy this previously for another baby and I don't recall the battery running out for a long time.
My baby liked the massaging action but it took time for him to realize how to do it. When he finally did, the battery gave out nearly the same day. The battery would work in short spurts after a rest but I wouldn't waste my money on it again.
Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn't have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her.
My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.
I've bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.
If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.
We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.
I have two and the batteries haven't died which I find impressive. These are well made. A year later, my son still likes these and likes the green spinner on the end a lot.
The product is great. I would push down the edges to make it vibrate and hold it against my baby's gums and he seemed to like it. However, the reason I gave it four stars and not five is because he doesn't bite down hard enough to make it vibrate on his own, and so he lost interest in it fairly quickly.
Everyone should buy this!  Such a soothing gift.  My granddaughter liked to just explore with it as well,  Not necessarily just to sooth gums.
Our 6 month old can't bite on this thing hard enough to make it vibrate on his own, so we have to squeeze it and help him hold it in his mouth (it's also heavy).  He seems to enjoy the way it feels, but it's actually so hard to squeeze that even our hands get tired after a minute or so.  Maybe better for older teethers?
My daughter loves to chew on both ends of this teething aid.  She also likes it because it has some weight to it and she can really throw it pretty far! I would recommend this teething aid if you're looking for a vibrating teether.
Don't waste your money, my son would rather suck on his fingers than to use this messaging corn teether.  The massager really has to be squeezed in order to work. :(
I bought this for my 2.5 year old with special needs, on the recommendation of her occupational therapist. It sooths her like nothing else. We put it in her mouth and she immediately relaxes and even falls asleep with it. Unfortunately, from all that use, they don't even last a week in our house. I'm still buying more.
This is a great toy for teething babies!  The colors catch their attention while the different shapes keep their hands and mouths amused.  The size is just right for them to actually hold on to it too.  I'd recommend it to any parent of a very young child- especially for the price!
my daughter likes this a lot.  its more like a teething ring than a necklace, though.  i read some complaints about the star-- the edges of the star are rounded but if choped at a bad angle, I think it could still be an issue, but i watch my daughter with it.
I got this carrier before my son was born. I was a nanny and have tried many carriers with babies of various sizes. This is the most comfortable and versatile carrier I've tried yet.The downsides are that it is a little challenging to use. I have had to learn quite a few different ways to carry my son, who is just 3 months old. If you don't adjust the carries you use as your baby grows, it can be very uncomfortable for both you. It is also very bulky. It doesn't even fit in an empty diaper bag. My next carrier will be unpadded.
I love these sheets because they are a thick and durable material. They fit on a standard pack-n-play too which is nice. Definitely worth the price.
I ordered this as a spare for my original Co-Sleeper. There really aren't a ton of places you can buy these, so I wasn't too concerned about the price. All told, Baby Bungalow did offer it for the best price, including shipping.While the sheet is a perfect fit, I was perplexed by the 'button' holes on the under side of each corner. Can't imagine what those are for. That or my Co-Sleeper is on the older side and there have been design changes since.Overall, quality product.
My daughter loves this but like others have said it doesn't fit on the Graco Quattro Travel System.  I have gotten it to work but sometimes it gets in the way of latching the snack tray on the front.  I still love it and so does my daughter.
I was a little nervous because so many people wrote that this adorable product did not fit Graco strollers well.  I am thrilled to report, however, that it fits the Graco Metrolite stroller perfectly and looks adorable!  Wonderful product!
I just bought this toy because it was the only one I could find in the store for a stroller.. And of course it won't fit on our Graco stroller.
We have/had a Graco Quattro and a MetroLite stroller and This doesn't fit on either one!!  It was a complete waste of money! Try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying!
you couldn't ask for a better diaper pail. one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers. great product!
I originally had another pail and it broke after about 9 months of use, so I got this one. I love it! It is very easy to use and keeps the diapers away from little hands. It has a large capacity and cuts back on frequent trips to the trash can. I keep a stick on air freshner in the bottom and it helps with lingering smells. Also no expensive refills to buy! Great pail.
Before my first child was born, I was all set to buy the Diaper Genie but then a friend told me about the Diaper Champ. She said that it did a good job and I didn't have to buy any special bags. So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags. My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great. It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all. I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors. So far this has been a great product. The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much. Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly! But so far so good!!
I love this product...  My sister in law has a baby 4 months older than my daughter, and she has a diaper genie.  She is stuck having to buy the special cartridges.  So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.  Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper. With the Diaper Genie, you have to twist the darn thing and it's hard to operate.  My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house... she ends up cutting the bags.  When she's at my house, she can't go wrong, just flip the handle! The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner!!!!
I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It's very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!
This product isn't that bad... however it is not smell proof.  I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag, but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby's room and it does not smell pleasant.
I like the Diaper Champ.  My little boy's room doesn't stink from dirty diapers.  I empty it once a week, when it is time for trash pick-up.  I like the fact of using regular trash bags instead of having to buy special bags.  I do wipe it down a couple of times a month.  I have also put in a box of baking soda to help absorb the odors inside.  I highly recommend this product.  It is very easy to drop in your dirty diapers.
In registering and purchasing products for my baby, I did a lot of research.  This included reading reviews, asking friends (lots) about products that did and didn't work for them, and actually trying to use some of the products.  I decided to go w/ the Diaper Champ after learning that the overwhelming majority of my friends absolutely hated that leading diaper pail the Diaper Genie and actually trying to use that awful contraption.  In fact in one circle of friends the Diaper Genie was re-gifted about four times b/c they were simply trying to get rid of it. I also did not like the idea of having to buy the special bags that the Diaper Genie requires.  The diaper champ uses regular kitchen bags. I have NEVER experienced an odor problem.  If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!  I usually change mine twice a week on garbage day.-You still have to clean the thing!! I usually spray the inside w/ Lysol when I change the bag and/ or wipe it w/ antibacterial wipes.  On occasion I wipe it w/ cleaner just as I would clean by bathroom.-For those complaining about toddler diaper odors.  Toddlers eat solids, their poop smell very adult like!  We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.
So far we love our Diaper Champ.  We have been using it for 3 months and have had no problem with smells.  We liked the fact that you could use regular trash bags instead of special refills.
i refused to buy the genie for the simple reason of i didnt want to be bothered with refills and i read that it clogged.  so i decided on this one and glad i did.  it is most excellent at keeping the foulest of stenches out.  and i love that i dont have to buy those EXPENSIVE refills.  just use the bags you have in your kitchen!  easy to replace when full and it just works!!!
I bought this pail before my son was born. First we bought the Safety 1st Odor-less pail, but it was broken, and the store was out of stock when we returned it. I read the reviews and found this one sounded the best.I love that it is so easy to use. My husband didn't even want a diaper pail because he didn't expect them to hold in any odors at all. Now that we have this one, he loves it. It's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper. No twisting till your wrist breaks. At first we were using scented trashbags, but I've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well. I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags. My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers. The only problem we've had is that if you don't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail. All in all it's been a great buy.
I love the Diaper Champ...you don't have the need for expensive refills and there is very little odor.  The main odor is revealed when it is time to change the bag.  You almost want to change the bag outside!  I find that if I keep a small air freshener in the bottom, it does help...(like one for a car).  So easy to use, definitely recommend!!!
We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we don't have to buy special bags. I love that you can use trash bags. I haven't had a problem with the bag not being full enough. For one, when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full, but is also very heavy so you wouldn't want anymore diapers in there anyway. The only problem I've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit. Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though. So overall I love the Diaper Champ!
My husband and I decided to get this one over the Diaper Genie because like most people, we didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.  We went to Costco and bought a big thing of garbage bags to use that seems to be lasting us FOREVER. Our daugher is now 4 months old, and we never had a problem with this. No odor or anything.  Extremely easy to use, no assembly required.
We've been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!  The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!  We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we've have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn't even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.  Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase.
We didn't want to spend a fortune on a diaper pail and refills, so we opted for the Diaper Champ. We absolutely love it. We have used it for three months now and have had no problems with smells of any kind. Best of all, you can use any kind of bag, including reused plastic grocery bags!
This is one of the things I can't live without. There are no bad smells until you open it. Using regular garbage bags is a huge money saver and there is plenty of room for tons of diapers! Plus it can also be used as a trash can!
I absolutely love this diaper champ. I was first drawn to it because no special bags were needed. It is so easy to use - one handed diaper disposable with the quick flip handle and so easy to empty. This item is a MUST HAVE!!!
I have used this for 11 months and I love it. What we did was after the baby started having odor in his #2s we bought some of those diaper bags from dollar tree (100 for $1) and put the dirty diapers in those little bags. So easy! Never an odor problem. And I use regular kitchen garbage bags in it, so no special bags to buy.I did research when I was registering before the baby and looked at all of the other diaper pails and this one was the one that came out ahead. I am glad I researched it because I am very happy with it!
the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink. of course you have to clean the whole thing out from time to time (which should be expected considering the toxic waste it stores!), but i never had any issues with smell, unless it was so full it had to be emptied anyway. what sold me on this diaper pail vs. the others, is that this one takes ANY plastic bag you want to put in it, meaning grocery bags, trash bags... nothing fancy. as a new mom (or new parent) you have enough things to worry about and spend your money on; last thing you need is to head to the store for diaper pail bags. no complaints from me on this diaper pail.
ALL DIAPERS SMELL, no matter what you put them in, especially once your kid starts solid foods. Get over it. This pail is fantastic.  We use it for our dogs' poop bags, and line it with Ruffies scented trash bags (we use vanilla, they also have lavender, and they are cheap). There is no smell, except in the summer when it is hot (and that's only because the pail is outside on the back porch, the one we buy for the nursery will be inside in the air conditioning).
love it because it uses the bags from the grocery store.  way cheaper than others.  have to change regulary (2 times per week) when the baby gets on solids though.
The Champ is the ultimate in Diaper disposal.  We tried the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and more expense than we wanted (2 sets of refills every month).  The Diaper Champ uses regular trash bags (we like the scented 13 gallon bags by Ruffies) and is absolutely a no-brainer to operate!  Simply drop the diaper in the cubby on top and flip the handle!  The diaper falls into the belly of the champ and that's it!  Drop and flip!  No twisting, shoving or cutting like the Genie.  And this is perfect for babies that grow into inquisitive toddlers - the Champ is much bigger than the Genie so it can't be easily hauled around by an adventurous baby and it's easy to keep her out of the messy contents as well (unlike regular diaper pails or trash cans)!Another reason I prefer the Champ is the fact that there are no "blades" involved.  I just didn't like the idea of a diaper disposal with blades in my nursery.  The thought that someday she might get into the pail and possibly be cut on the sharp blades used for separating the bags - was frightening!  This is not a worry when it comes to the champ.  Just simple, clean, odor resistant, in-expensive to maintain/operate and safe!I'd recommend the Champ to anyone - buy it, you won't be sorry!
This is a wonderful product.  One suggestion to the manufacturer--the blue piece that holds the bag in place--perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out.  Right now, it's only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it.
This is a great pail.  It originally appealed to me because of the cost benefit of using any old plastic bag.  We buy the generic tall kitchen bags.  We soon found that another benefit is that you only have to change the bag every 6 or 7 days!  Additionally, it really has a one-handed operation.
We like that this product uses regular trash bags while still containing a lot of diapers.  It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.  Highly recommend this.
Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!) - won't topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.
I purchased this diaper pail after struggling for several months with the Diaper Genie.  The Diaper Champ was hands down the best diaper pail I used while my child was in diapers (I used three: Diaper Genie, Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and the Diaper Champ).  I didn't have to spend loads of money on the special Diaper Genie bags anymore, it had far superior odor control as compared to the Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and it's really easy to use - drop a diaper in, flip the handle over, done!  I actually developed pain in my elbow from all the twisting the Diaper Genie required as it wrapped each diaper into its little sausage-like casing.  I passed this diaper pail on to a friend once I was finished with it, and will happily purchase it for other friends in the future.
I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don't change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it's a diaper, bad when it's,,, your keys.
Let's face it.  This is a specially designed garbage can to hold human feces.  One cannot expect that it will be odor free.  Mine certainly isn't.  It is my fault, though.  If I emptied the bag more often, there would not be a stench.  But alas, I am lazy.  So when I do change the bag, I also spray some lysol.  Works for me.  I like it that you just have to flip the handle for the diaper to go bye bye.When I first got the product, I really hurt my finger trying to open the thing.  But that was my own fault.  I did not have it on the floor.  When opening the lid, step on the stabilizer ring at the bottom of the unit and it opens with ease.I too love that you do not have to buy special bags for this.  What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags.  Thanks, but no.All in all, I really like my Diaper Champ.  It's also taller than the genie which is good for me, I don't have to bend over so much to flip the lid.
Stay away from the other brands that require special refill bags.  What a waste of money!  Even the "new and improved" Diaper Genie can't compare to the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills. I can't imagine why anyone would want to constantly buy expensive refills for a diaper pail, when a simple trash bag is all you need.As for the "smell" issue. Let's face it - diapers stink. And regardless of brand, ANY DIAPER PAIL WILL NEED TO BE EMPTIED ON A REGULAR BASIS. I really think some people don't realize this.  When I first had my son, I bought a diaper champ to keep at my mom's house.  When my mom used to change him, she'd dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ, but didn't change the pail.  After about a week she complained because it started to stink.  I had to explain to her that it wasn't a "magic pail", it was still just a covered trash bin.  (honestly, how did she raise 2 kids?...)  Now, mom's back on track and loving her Diaper Champ.As far as the odor issue goes, I have seen no difference in odor control between the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel, but neither are odor proof.
I was recommended this by a fellow mom before we had our daughter and purchased it from Baby's R Us.  It's fabulous!  We've been using it for almost 15 months now and still love it!  We save $$ on those expensive diaper genie refills AND it works great.  We put wet diapers in a seperate trash can (because they don't smell) and so we only put dirty diapers in the Diaper Champ so we only have to change the bag once a week and IT DOES NOT SMELL!!  A few times I'd forget to change it (I change it, my husband takes it out to the trash) and if a FULL bag of stinky diapers is left for more than a few days, it does begin to smell, but ANY diaper pail would stink if it was full for more than a few days.  So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!  :-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!
To put it simply, this is a necessary item for every home with a baby..-no refill bags (tip--can store extra empty bags inside in the bottom)-easy to empty & clean-no odors-not big & bulky
This diaper pail is excellent. No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months.  I am very pleased with it.  I do have one word of caution: Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder.  They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside.  Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out. I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why).  Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.  Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly.
My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones. Probably any diaper pail will do until your child is about six months old, and then none will work that great. Yes, you do have to air them out once in a while, and clean them frequently (yay for Lysol), but the plastic does absorb odors no matter what. Our Diaper Champ has reached its limit, and we are going to buy another one.Why another Champ, when it still lets out smells? All diaper pails smell!! Every mother of a two-year-old that I know is going to drastic lengths to air out their pail, no matter what brand they bought. No one will be reusing theirs for a second child.So I'm getting another Champ because I like these things:- I can use it with one hand and can keep the other hand on my baby- I don't have to buy special refils (I do use odor-fighting garbage bags that really help)- I don't have to explain how to use it to babysitters.That's it. Hope that helps.
This is another great baby purchase.  When I brought it home, my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a "gadgety" baby thing that we didn't need.  He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked!First, it really keeps the odor in.  I'm pretty sensitive to smells, but this one does a good job of containing odors.  Just to play it safe though, I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so (you could probaby go longer), and I spray it with Lysol as well.  Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.  Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain---I definitely recommend this product!
We are 1st time parents &amp; I read all the reviews on diaper-disposal products.  Now our baby is 1 month old &amp; I've never smelled a poopy diaper (and we formula feed) in our nursery which is in our master bedroom.  We are both clean-addicts &amp; love this product. (NO EXPENSIVE REFILLS NEEDED!!!) We empty it twice per week &amp; have NO ODOR problems!Update at 7mos(July04): We managed to get BabiesRUs to let us exchange the DiaperChamp for a DiaperGenie and we were equally dissapointed with it too.  DiaperChamp was great until about 3 mos. &amp; then just smelled all the time.  Diaper Genie was no better - even with toddler-strength refills.  I have found it so much easier to use cheap ziplocks and throw diapers in regular trash that goes out each night anyway (both Diaper keepers required emptying every day &amp; would still smell).  I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.  Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.  Dissapointing - wish it worked!
Someone told me not to get the Diaper Genie, but invest my money in the Champ.  What sold me on it is that the Champ uses ordinary garbage bags, nothing proprietary.  As my baby gets older and the poops get stinkier, we do have some odor problems, but we tend to cram the diaper bags as full as possible.  If we changed it every couple of days, there would probably not be an issue.  When we smell something, we change the bag; problem solved.  My only *real* problem with it is that, now that my son is walking, he likes to put things into the hole and turn the handle to watch them disappear.  I keep waiting for the day when he throws away something important and I don't catch it!
ABSOLUTELY NO ODORS!!  I have a beagle who completely ignores the diaper champ, will eat out of every other garbage can in the house, but ignores the champ.  a bit of a struggle as diapers get bigger, but totally worth the money!!! also, a bit of a pain to clean...either outside with the hose or in the tub.  No refills and odor free..can't beat that!!
My girlfriend recommended the diaper champ over the diaper genie so I put it on my registry.  It certainly seems to contain the odors.  It's great that it uses regular garbage bags - no expensive refill bags to purchase.  The only small problem I've noticed is that it stops working before the pail is full because it stacks the diapers through a narrow hole.  Also, when it's time to change the bag, wear a nose plug.
Love this product - no smell - easy to change the bags - I don't have any complaints.
We like it that this diaper pail uses regular garbage bags instead of specialty diaper pail inserts/liners.  The mechanism works well to dispose of the diapers and attempt to keep the smell isolated, but at a certain level of the room (usually nose-height when you're sitting on the floor) you can still smell poo.  It works well to bundle the diapers into compact little bundles and use the velcro to seal the bundles before you put it in the diaper hole.  Overall, we are very satisfied.
I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out.
If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.  When it came down to it, I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills. Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let's face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!  I think it is great!
Works well as diaper pail, but it's awesome as a bathroom garbage can.  No mess, no smell. Very easy to replace garbage bags, you do not have to touch anything.Got it as a gift, and was very skeptical about it at first. (It's only 100ft to the garbage  shoot outside the apartment).  That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up.  Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day.
I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills. Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of? I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula. I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"The Champ works great. We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags. We've never experienced odor from the pail. It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion. I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...Highly recommended!!! Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
The Diaper Champ has been wonderful in our home!! It locks away the smell so wonderfully that we purchased a second one for downstairs. I originally chose this one, because it doesn't use costly refills. The lid is quite heavy, so you do have to be careful of your fingers when changing the bags, but that's the only concern I've had with it. When you do open it to change the bags, you may want to do so outside. You'll quickly see just how well it locks the odors in.
I admit when I was an expecting father one of my concerns was diaper changing, mostly because of the odors (anyone with me on this one?) As much as the odors won't go away during changing time, they do -as a matter of fact- dissapear once you throw the dirty diaper in the Diaper Champ. Put it in the top hole, roll the top with the handle, in the diaper goes and bye-bye to all odor!As if this were not already great, there's a big plus to this product, when you compare it to its biggest competitor, the Diaper Genie by Playtex. Although this one costs $5 the first time around, it won't require special bags as the Genie does, which cost $15 per set... this one takes your standard Glad bags you can get in Costco, BJs, Sam's or your local supermarket, so rejoice! (for diaper odors are over when the diaper goes in); and don't spend too much money to accomplish such a mundane task: make sure you get your Diaper Champ!
My son is four months and this product is perfect.  No smells at all!  Holds a decent amount of diapers, my husband empties it once a week.  No down side, all pluses here!  Especially no special bags to buy.  And when your child is out of diapers, you can use it as a regular trash can to put food or pet waste in.
You cannot imagine how much money you'll save and it doesn't smell AT ALL!!! You can use any kitchen size garbage bags without a problem and use it for A WEEK without having to change the bag. IT'S WONDERFULL!!!
I LOVE this product. My sister (mother of 2) recommended this to me and I am so grateful. It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better! This is a must have for any new parent!
This is one of the items that I absolutely love, something I'd rather not live without. The only time I've ever noticed a smell is when you leave the poopy diapers in the pail too long.Love it!
We registered for the diaper champ mostly based on the reviews and the fact that no special bags were needed. I am very impressed with how easy it is to change the bag and I have not had any problems with smells. We use the odor guard trash bags but I doubt it has much effect (it doesn't in the kitchen anyway). The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective. Would definitely recommend
The Diaper Champ is a life saver.  We have had no problems with odor at all as some other reviewers have complained of.  We empty it out about 2 times per week and only when we open the lid to take the trash bag out do we smell anything.  Once it's sealed shut, no stench whatsoever.  No complaints about the Diaper Champ, especially since it is so easy on the pocket-book compared to the rest of the diaper pails out there.
I love this product. You can use any regular trash bag. So far we have noticed NO odors. It is easy to use. It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ. The price is very affordable as well.
I've tried the two other most popular diaper pails and am happiest with this one.  It is easy to change the bag, uses any trash bag, and does a decent job of containing odor.  I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.  I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.  Let's face it....no diaper pail is perfect, but this one is the best that I've used.
This is a great diaper pail.  There is no odor and it is very easy to use.  (You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.)  Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).  And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
At first me and my husband didnt know if we really wanted to get diaper pails for our twins. We thought since the babies were going to be at his parents house while we were at work. A garbage can would do just as well. We did reg for the diaper champ to keep at the grandparents house. We ended up getting 1 for their home and 2 for our home. We are SO HAPPY we did. They are so easy to use. You dont have to push the dirty diaper down with your hand you just lay it in the champ and turn the handle over. At 6 months old yes the diapers are starting to get bigger but you just fold them with the velco of the diapers and its so easy. Ive had no problems of getting them stuck. With the diaper champ you can use any kind of bags which is great!!! There really is no oder with the diaper champ. We take the dirty diaper out every 4-5 days depends on how many we go through in a weeks time :), but even when their is a "dirty" diaper there is no smell in the room. Sometimes if we have a very "messy diaper" we just take it directly to the garage. All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama. We wash it out once a month or sooner with bleach and water just help get rid of some germs. We also spray it with cleaner weekly to help with those nasty germs! All around its a great product. It really is hands free, which means less mess, and their is no costly replacement bags that you have to mess around with!
We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!
This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!! I strongly recommend it.
We just couldn't bring ourselves to buy a pail that required us to purchase extra refills.  This pail is great.  I do put really dirty diapers into a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail, to reduce the chance of nasty seepage and rub-off onto the chamber as the diaper is moved into the bottom.  It is not difficult to open, and the fact that it has a good clasp offers a sense of security for when our little girl starts pulling herself up on things, which will be soon (she's 8 months old).  We change the bag a couple of times a week, and the nursery smells fine.
I would definitely recommend choosing the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie, since you can use regular kitchen trash bags instead of expensive Genie refills. Definitely reduces the odor (just be prepared for the awful smell when you open the top to change the bag!!!) and is easy to clean. Love it!!!
My husband and I love this product. Several friends of ours recommended it, and I'm so happy that we purchased it. It's large enough to hold many diapers, and it really does keep our nursery odor-free.  I really like that we don't need to purchase expensive bags to use with it. We just use regular kitchen garbage bags. My sister had the Diaper Genie, which is tough to use and too small.  This product is much better.
We also wanted the diaper champ instead of the Genie because...who wants to buy special bags??  It is a life saver to just throw in a kitchen garbage bag.  We ended up receiving ours as a hand-me-down, and I was worried that it would smell.  Surprisingly enough - it only starts to smell when it's time to change the bag. And sure enough, the lid would start "sticking" right about that time, which told me that the bag was full and it was time to change it (instead of struggling to stuff another couple diapers in).  Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.  Just keep some Lysol wipes by the changing table, and wipe it down if you get anything anywhere. Piece of cake.
The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper.  (Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink.
This product is wonderful!  It is very easy to use, refill, and move around.  My only complaint is that it could be a little bigger to hold a bit more.  It keeps the smell OUT completely!  The fact that I can use a regular trash bag is a definite plus to a mommy with a small budget!I highly recommend this product!
......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star..... Please don't buy this one!
I registered for this diaper pail as opposed to a Diaper Genie because I didn't want to have to purchase refills.  So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.  It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.  I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.  I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
I have never bought any other diaper pail, so I am not sure how it stacks up, but the Diaper Champ has proven to be a good product! I use odor-reducing trash bags & the smell is very minimal. One little downfall is that it seems to fill up fast (by 3 days!)which makes it hard to turn the cover. It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table. Overall, I am happy with this product & do recommend it.
We've used this Diaper Champ for the past 8 months and it's worked great. No problems or odors at all. The best part is you use regular kitchen trash bags, no expensive specialty bags to buy.
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED! You use any type of bag you want, and I love this idea. The refills for all the others are so spendy and they don't hold that many diapers. I'd rather buy cheap 13 gallon garbage bags from wal-mart or use one of the gazillion plastic grocery bags we already have in a cupboard at home. It also keeps the smell away perfectly fine-until you open it of course to take the bag out to the garbage can! It's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well. I think it's great and I highly recommend it to every family that loves to save money.
My husband and I hated this diaper pail from the day we first began using it.  The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.  It is no fun pulling apart a diaper pail at 2:00 in the morning because the handle won't go down due to a diaper that is stuck in it.  Plus, I think it is unsanitary.  The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail, and then they drop through to the bag.  Well, messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area, and it was not easy to clean.  Finally, after two months of dealing with this pail, one morning, I flipped the handle, and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail.  (It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it, either!)  I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it, so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now, and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week.  I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.  I do not recommend this product.
We have purchased this diaper pail four years ago [I was so disgusted with Diaper Genie we had at the time (not just wasting the money on the refills, but also the smell and having to push & twist was more than I wanted to deal with)].Diaper Champ was so much easier to operate! When my daughter turned one, she started disposing of her diapers herself and she never failed!We used regular grocery bags and changed them twice a week to avoid them getting too full and/or smelly. [We've discovered that regular shopping bags from Target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we're now using them with daughter #2, replacing them once a week]. We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001! It's virtually indestructible, easy to wash and operate, doesn't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it, and it DOES NOT SMELL!I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
We purchased the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie because we didn't want to buy special bags.  We have now used it for a year and it has been great!  We can use our regular garbage bags so the cost is very minimal and we don't have to worry about going out and buying those special bags like for the Diaper Genie.We use cloth diapers and it works really well for that.  We change the bag almost daily, as we have two in diapers and cloth diapers are bulkier.  When it gets hard to turn, it is time to change the bag!The Diaper champ really minimizes the odor and is very easy to clean up, we just wipe it with a soapy cloth and sometimes spray a little disinfectant to help with the smell.This is great and I would recommend it for everyone.
Love the Diaper Champ.  I had planned to get the Diaper Genie, but after I read the reviews, the Diaper Champ won out!  I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don't have to purchase specific bags.  That's way too much of a headache and expense that I don't need.  It's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven't had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn't want to do without.
PRO'S1. Doesn't take up too much space2. Very easy to use.3. Very easy to empty.4. Can use regular trash bags (saves money!)CON'S1. There is a slight smell when my son delivers a REALLY stinky muddy diaper. (other than that there is no smell. I just throw the "bombers" in the trash outside.FYI1. Don't let it get too full, otherwise it is hard to pull the trash bags out to empty. And once it is open (stinky!!!) you don't want to waste any time getting the full bag out of the house.UPDATE: Our son is now 9.5 months old and it just stinks. No matter if there is a diaper in there or not. We have cleaned it, sprayed it, bleached it, put dryer sheets in it, well you name it and we have tried it. THE THING STINKS!!! We have since tried other bags and such but if you walk in my sons room you smell the diaper champ. It is going out I am sad to say. But we did get several smell free months out of it. Also just a note. My son started eating solid food and went to formula when it started stinking real bad!
No special bags to buy... change at least twice per week (especially in the summer) and you are good to go. Remember this thing contains poop, so if it is not changed often, it will smell.
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail. I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags. Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.' In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!! I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week. For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!! Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two. SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful. Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
Here's what I like about this product: it's easy to change, and it provides a leak-proof barrier between the baby and the mattress. Here's what I don't like: the snaps are not a great fit for my crib and sometimes come undone; one snap stopped working altogether; and the sheet wrinkles and is difficult to smooth out.All in all, the good outweighs the bad. The sheet is particularly handy for newborns who might leak during the night, requiring sheet changes when you're half asleep. I only use it now when I know he is prone to leaking, such as when he is between diaper sizes. Otherwise, I use regular sheets. Put it on your registry.
It's a nice thick pad and seems comfortable enough to use in place of a sheet everyday, but it's too expensive for a sheet and because it has the rubber bottom, you can't really put it in the dryer without harming it. It takes a long time to hang dry. If it were less expensive, I'd get a few more. So I use it as a water proof pad and put a sheet over the top of it, but that takes away from the ease of putting it on the mattress, since It gets tucked in the fitted sheet.
Was really, really excited to get these, then read what it is made out of, the very bottom layer is PVC. Now why would I want my newborn daughter to sleep on this and breathe it in? Not in a lifetime. Plus, when I opened the package, it smelled of plastic. I will do the laundry when she messes up the bed and deal with it rather risk exposure to PVC fumes.
works great to keep the mattress and sheets under dry.  It also is good enough to be used without a cover, my daughter doesnt mind it.  Its practical and good for the money paid, recommended.
These should be in everyone's registry. It's something you don't think about, but will save you when you're totally exhausted and your baby spits up in bed. Just unsnap, throw in the washer and go back to bed!Soft, waterproof, love these.
These sheets have survived numerous washes without fail. We keep one on the crib (or folded over in the pack n play) at all times. They've saved us many nights of wrestling to change sheets, we just change these!
When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere.
I thoroughly enjoy this product. It covers the full top surface of the crib, give or take an inch. My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months. The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture. I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet, another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet (since the playpen pad can't be easily washed), and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently. I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it. The snaps work well on small crib rails. They may not fit around larger crib posts. I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib. At 3am, I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress.
UPDATE: After washing them only a few times, the snaps have been falling off so this sheet is not very sturdy. I now call it a "disposable sheet" and would rate it only 3 stars if I was allowed to change the rating.My previous review:This sheet is a fantastic idea. Imagine waking up to feed your baby only to have them spit up and/or poop/pee on the bed sheet. Instead of taken apart the bumper to remove the mattress to change the sheet, all that is required is to unsnap the corners that secure sheet in place. Then you put another one on...the whole process will take you less than 5 minutes. I have three, one for the hamper, one on the crib, and one waiting to be used in case of a bed wetting!
I registered for the Ultimate Crib Sheet after reading reviews in books and online.  All the praise is accurate!!!  It's better than the standard sheet savers because it covers the entire top of the matress - not just one part.  It snaps securely in place and can be changed in seconds!  I keep the regular crib sheet on the mattress for looks only (matches bumper and skirt) - baby never actually comes in contact with it.  Get two or three Ultimate Crib Sheets for easy changes - SO much easier to change than the regular sheets...removing and replacing the bumper for those sheet changes is a huge pain and time consuming.  This product makes cleaning up so easy!  The only drawback is that it only comes in white, but since it can only be seen looking INTO the crib, it not a big issue for me.
I thought this looked wonderful in the store so I registered for a couple.  Afterwards I attempted to put a cute sheet and mattress pad in the crib... such a chore!  I started using these and haven't had to change the cute sheet since.  It's so easy to just snap on and not fuss with anything else.  It's a soft sheet on top, an absorbent layer in the middle, and a waterproof vinyl back so nothing leaks through.  I've changed it in the middle of the night in a couple minutes tops... it washes up great with my baby's normal laundry too!  I highly recommend these sheets.
at the head and foot of the sheet there are snaps that can come completely off.one elastic strap end snaps to the sheet then wraps around the crib rail and snaps back onto the sheet. if you undo both snaps you are left with a loose elastic band. baby could choke on it if you ask me. i liked the product for its ease of use.. but once i noticed the straps could snap completely off.. i stopped using it.
When your little one spits up, vomits, or leaks in the middle of the night, this is a LIFESAVER!  Ok, I am exaggerating, but it sure beats getting the mattress out, taking off the fitted sheet, and then putting another on.  Just snap the buttons off, throw it in the washer, and put your little one back in the crib.  I have never had a problem with it shrinking but then I've never thrown it in the wash.
This is such a helpful product that helps keep the baby's sheets protected. I love how it has saved me from changing the entire crib sheets off of the mattress. It's saved me money since it protected the crib sheet so well that I haven't bought any new crib sheet. I'm still using the ones that I received during my baby shower. The elastic snaps definitely serve a purpose for safety so I use them but they are a little tiresome. If there were a better, yet safe, alternative for the snaps I would have given this product 5 stars. Overall, I'd highly recommend this product.
The first time I went to change the crib sheet on my baby's crib I understood the importance of the Ultimate Crib Sheet!  It was given as a gift & I put one more on my registry after realizing I had to take the whole crib ensemble apart to change the sheet!  Now I change the sheet only occasionally & it is more for asthetics.  The Ultimate Cribe sheet snaps off & I put a clean one on - so easy & practical!  Save money on sheets & just get one or two decorative sheets & get at least 2 of these!!!Update at 7 mos (July04): I have survived VERY WELL with 2 of the Ultimate Crib Sheets - and boy when they start slithering around the crib & wetting through diapers & spitting up solids - you will be SO thankful to have this little dandy item!  Don't go without!!!!
I bought three of these before my son was born and it was money well spent - we bought one cute sheet that goes with his bedding that we leave on and change the ultimate crib sheet as needed. Believe me, when your little one spits up in the middle of the night and you need to change the sheet, you will be so thankfull you just have to unsnap and put a fresh one on. Changing crib sheets with a bumber in place is a major pain! These are super soft, hold up to repeated washing, stay in place and absorb the mess away from your baby. Return all those cute sheets you bought and invest in a bunch of these - you won't regret it!
My sister recommended this product to me, and I wanted to like it.  It is very waterproof!  But the waterproof barrier makes this not breathable.  My baby would sweat profusely.  We always keep our house at 68-70 and dressed him in a cotton sleeper.  If he was laying on his back, his chest would be cool, but his back would be hot and sticky.  Or if laying on his stomach, his front would be sweaty, but his back cool.  Basically, whatever was touching the mattress pad could not breath and it was uncomfortable no matter what temperature adjustment we made.I will say the design configuration is very practical and a great idea.  Changing a fitted mattress sheet is a giant pain in the butt.  This pad makes it easy to clean up the crib after an accident and speed is critical in the middle of the night.I purchased a felted 100% wool mattress pad instead and couldn't be happier.  It was slightly more expensive, but it was worth it.  Wool is a truly fabulous product: very breathable, helps regulate body temp, naturally water resistant, anti bacterial and NATURAL!!!!  No man-made plastics or vinyl that you have to worry about weird off-gassing chemicals.  My baby stays dry and comfortable.
I had bought this sheet on the recommendation of others from Babies R Us.  The snaps make it a breeze to change, I'm so glad I don't have to take the mattress out of the crib all the time!  The waterproof backing is great not just for the diaper leaks but also for the spit-ups.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the snaps don't fit exactly around my crib rungs so it's a little wrinkled and off center, but my baby doesn't seem to mind.
Yes i have pretty sheets on the crib......but who wants to wash them every time there is a mess.  Well this is the answer!  So much easier (since they snap around the crib slats) to get on and off!  Waterproof!!  What else should i say!  Perfect gift!!!
I measured the crib before purchasing this, but it was not a hood fit for our standard Jenny Lind crib. Some of the elastic snaps could not stretch far enough to snap closed, so they just hung thee. It did not make me feel comfortable to have those straps dangling since they could have been a potential choking hazard.
I bought this, put it on the crib, took one look at it, took it off, and returned it.  I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it--it bunched and wouldn't lay flat.  Also the snaps didn't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure.  This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment.  My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I don't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway.
A must have with babies. Buy at least two of these. Easy to wash and can be used anywhere, not only crib. Remove the elastic tabs and put it on the livingroom floor for baby to play or sleep.
My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months, so this product was wonderful.  However, by the time that he was 6 months old, all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs.  The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones (maybe a different brand) for future children, but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these.
I love this item.  It is much easier for those middle of the night diaper mishaps, to just go in and unsnap the top sheet and put baby back to bed.  I have washed and dried the sheet and had no problems what-so-ever.
Yes, scratchy!  I was quite surprised by the rough texture of the top layer of the sheet.  It feels like very cheap, low thread count material, not nearly as soft as most bedsheets.  When my daugher used this sheet, she had a skin rash and started getting a bold spot on the back of her head.  It's possible, of course, that these were unrelated to the sheet.  However, both problems improved substantially when we removed it and put her on a softer, normal bed sheet.Also, I agree with another poster that this could be a dangerous product, especially if your baby is older and moves around her crib a lot.  There is no way to tuck the sides under, as with a regular sheet, so a baby could find her way under the sheet and suffocate.  Keep in mind, too, that undoing the snaps is very easy--so easy, a baby could do it!  The elastic bands connecting the sheet to the crib also make me nervous.  Could an older baby pinch or strangle herself in these?My daughter is now six months, and rolls around her crib.  I won't be regularly using this sheet anymore.  But, there is an upside.  This product is AMAZINGLY easy to use.  Snap, snap--that's it.  There is no lifting the mattress.  And it is waterproof underneath (unlike a certain zipper sheet, I could name), so in an emergency you don't have to worry about the mattress.  Recently, my daughter had a stomach virus, diarrhea everywhere.  To make matters worse, I caught it and was too light-headed to lift a 20lb crib mattress.  This sheet was perfect.
I played the game of frustration everytime I had to change a crib sheet......which became much more often after more blow outs and spitting up began!  I knew I wanted to keep the bumper and searched the internet to find a solution.  This was the first recommendation to pop up with rave reviews!  I tried one out and absolutely loved it! Changing sheets is a breeze!  They stay one very well too.  I liked it so much I ordered another to have as back up.  Highly recommended if you are done lifting that dang mattress up!
Our newborn baby boy has been having a ball spraying us every time we change him. Thank goodness we bought these crib sheets! I can't see the sheets underneath really well, since it covers the entire top of it, but it keeps it clean and dry. The top is soft, while the bottom is lined with plastic.
Try to change those sheets on a heavy crib mattress in the middle of the night after your kid has an accident and then try jus changing this pads. You will never go back!!  So easy to put, so easy to change, maybe not visually appealing but I go for practical not just looks. Best gift for a mom to be, well besides a prenatal massage :)
Lifesaver for this middle of the might diaper leaks! It's always a pain to change a crib sheet in the middle of the night, but this makes it so much easier. I just put it on top of his regular sheet (which is over a waterproof mattress pad). He occasionally has a diaper leak. When he does, I simply unsnap the ultimate crib sheet (there are roughly 10 snaps to keep it in place) and let him sleep the rest of the night on his regular sheet. The snaps can be a little tricky to remove with one hand (say when you're holding a baby), but I generally start unsnapping while he is still in the crib.
When my newborn was in her Co-Sleeper, changing wet bedding every morning was no big deal -- but a move to the crib meant a HUGE daily struggle to disassemble the bumper, manhandle the mattress and strip the sheet and mattress pad, then reverse the whole process after washing and drying. The Ultimate Crib Sheet is truly that: just undo a few snaps and toss it in the wash. It's soft and durable, and your expensive bedding and mattress pad stay fresh and dry. In hindsight, wish I'd had several of these on my registry.
This product was pitched to me as a "must have" by all my mommy friends. It has been good for us in terms of middle of the night accidents (so we don't have to put a whole new crib sheet on), but there is one major issue with it. The straps don't line up properly with our crib rails, so it can never be totally attached to the crib. There are always loose straps hanging off or awkward folds in it when we try to strap it down. We tried over and over again to get it right, but to no avail. We do not believe this is an issue with our crib as it is a brand new, high quality one. We finally gave up the idea of strapping the Ultimate Crib Sheet down and now just put it under the regular crib sheet. This is ok, but then when we do have a late night accident and have to pull off the top sheet we always worry about the Ultimate Sheet not being strapped down properly. It's a good idea, but needs to be redesigned to fit current crib railings. I wouldn't purchase this product again or recommend it to a friend.
I bought these because a good friend recommended them.  They are awesome especially when kids have runny noses etc.  It saves me from having to change the crib sheet.  The only downside is you can't see the pretty design on the crib sheet but for me that is really no big deal.
Started potty training and this has been our best purchase. Rarely my crazy sleeper will roll to a part of the bed thats not covered and pee but usually this pad protects the sheets and saves me from having to change all the sheets. Stays put. Washes well
The method that I used for potty training had me completely throw away the diapers and didn't allow for pull ups.  (It worked well!)  About a month after we started my daughter had a string of accidents at night out of the blue.  I was constantly changing sheets and was tired of it, that is when I found this.  Turns out my daughter was sick at the time, but once I got two of these it was so easy to just move her and take this pad off to wash it instead of stripping and remaking the bed.  I wish I had known about this when I first started potty training (for nap time and bedtime).  It is also relatively small to pack if you are traveling somewhere and you are afraid of your child wetting the bed this is great for that too.  I now have this off of her bed again, but I can't say enough good stuff about this product.
I use this along with a water proof mattress pad, to minimize the number of times I have to launder EVERYthing, and it is fantastic.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, without problems of any kind.  And my kids don't really even know it is there.
If your child moves around in the bed and you don't have this positioned exactly where they are they will miss.  And it doesn't secure to the bed that well.  I would look for something bigger and something that fits the entire bed, not just a small section.  I'll probably trash it and get a better one, I don't want to risk ruining my bed if my 3 year old misses the pad.!00% would not recommend it.
We are in the process of night-time training our 4 year old.  This has saved us a lot of sheet washing.  Considering the disposable pads run about $1 a piece, this quickly paid for itself.  I am considering getting another.
I got this because it used regular trash bags and you don't have to worry about a huge long twisted snaky thing unraveling when you take it to the trash.  I've been using it almost a year.  I do use those cheap Bowl Fresh toilet deodorizers instead of ordering the disks.  I clip the hanger off and break it in half (while it's still in the plastic) and add half or both, just depends.  The deodorizers last about 1-2 months and it's cheap! I empty it about every 3 days and spray it down w/ Lysol before adding another bag.  Not had any stinky problems and this is in my hallway right by the familyroom. I do take it outside every month and give it a good cleaning w/ bleach and a garden hose.
Excuse me,...but this product is so far from being odorless.  At first, it was (maybe a little less than a month), odorless then after that,...there was nothing to get rid of the scent.  I even bought some odor discs but they didn't work either.  The only convenient thing about this is that you can put whatever garbage bag you want in it and even then, the bag can hold many diapers.
Initially my husband and I decided not to purchase a diaper pail because we wondered what was the point, diapers stink and no matter how much money one spends on a diaper pail it's going to emit odors and smell bad. Then, when we were changing diapers ten times a day we decided it would probably be easier to have one, especially for the middle of the night diaper changes. Several of my friends disapproved of the Diaper Genie and recommended we purchase an inexpensive diaper pail that uses regular garbage bags. We took that advice and selected the Safety 1st diaper pail and we are pleased with the product. Odor-Less - No. We empty it as needed, usually once a week, and realize it's a diaper pail - just as our garbage pail in the Kitchen needs to be emptied daily someday so will the diaper pail. I place an aroma jell in the little basket which helps with the odor.
I really like this diaper pail.  It helps with odor control, but is certainly not odorless.  As if anything can disguise the odor of a poopy diaper.  I think that a diaper pail is a must in the nursery.  There are just too many diapers to not have one and an open garbage can or even a regular one is just too stinky.  This one has a lid that closes nicely to shut out odors.  It has a nice little compartment for odor disks to help manage odor.  It can be a bit of a hassle to empty and reload, but it only needs changing about every two days and since it fits regular kitchen bags, it is worth the money.  It isn't very expensive to begin with.
What a waste of money and more importantly my time!This thing does not work well at al!! I can't fit a larger cable through it.  PLUS if you have plugs that go sideways like our ROKU does. You can't use it. So i had to buy a power strip but the power strip is too thick and won't work. So this ended up in the garbage.
My little guy is very active and loves to get into trouble. We only have a couple items plugged into an outlet that isn't covered by furniture so I purchased these to make sure he couldn't pull the plug out of the wall and get shocked. They are wonderful and I feel much safer letting my little guy explore the house. Even though I am never too far away our let him out of sight he still manages to get into things. He is so fast and just a little distraction could be fatal. But I don't have to worry about the plugs anymore! One less worry and just the little bit of stress relief that makes this purchase very easy for me to recommend it to all parents.
These outlet covers do just what they are supposed to. I'm not at all concerned about my little ones being able to bust into them...they are hard enough for adults to disconnect! I wasn't sure about the quality of a Safety 1st product (seems to be hit or miss with this company), but I was pleasantly surprised by the integrity of these covers. And the price is great for a 2-pack.
Unfortunately you cannot tell from the picture, but this product is not well designed. It projects far out from the wall, and cannot accommodate any plugs larger than a two prong (meaning non grounded) table lamp cord. Anything like a power strip, laptop cord, etc, will not even be able to be plugged in because the casing blocks it. In addition, the slot to feed the cord through to exit the device is also very small and fits almost none of the electronics in my house. It also sits on top of the outlet cover, so there is no way to really secure it tightly and it can rotate a bit.
If you want to keep the plug in there forever, it is the best one. But the first time, you still need to open it to install. After you put it on the wall, it's really hard to remove. Another con is the cover is too small, that I cannot put anything other than a stand lamp in it.
These work great to keep kids out of the plugs and are easy enough to remove by an adult. We use them in our nursery.
I bought this thinking it was a great idea but you can't use it with any plugs that have a larger than standard plugs. I feel everything of my children's has an oversize plug that goes in the wall. Have yet found anything to use it for.
This thing works but it's very tricky getting off. If you work it a little you figure out how it will just pop off. Don't get discouraged like I did. Work it gently and It will come off easy with a little presure. Does not fit a bulky box plug in head only standard ones like a lamp.
My 2 year old hasn't been able to figure them out yet, so naturally, we're sold! He pretty much ignores them now. Yay!
I attempted to pop this thing open for about 20 minutes then gave up. It took both my husband and I 10 minutes to finally pry it open. Yes, it's childproof, but also adultproof too which is not convenient at all. It also doesn't fit all outlets. I ended up getting the Safety 1st covers because they don't have the sides that have to go into the wall, instead they protrude out.
I love this item. I got two for my apt. My kids are no longer turning the lights out or pulling cords. I absolutely love this item.

They are as shown, and work great so that kids can't pull out the many cords that we all use easily!  I would recommend it to anyone with young tots!
I tried to use this power strip cover for about 2 months when our twin daughters were 8-10 months old. It was frustrating for my husband & I -- hard to get the power strip inside, hard to keep things plugged in, and too big to hide out of the babies view (not to mention that it's bulky and a bit ugly). For the babies, it became yet another interesting thing around the house that we had to wrestle from their hands. They were able to unplug the cords easily and were starting to reach their fingers into the top hole when I finally gave up on using it. Yes, the cover did keep the babies from actually touching the outlets in the power strip, but I could have accomplished the same thing with a couple of normal outlet covers.In the end, I rearranged our cords making the power strip & this cover unnecessary. It was just too annoying to keep using the cover.
this helps from letting my daughter play with the actual outlet and plug in, but she can still pull the cord out of the plug in the inside.  so it does protect her from being electified, but she can still unplug the tv lol
I ordered this some time ago. I finally started using it last week. It was very difficult to figure out how to use. But, once I ready the instructions a few times I got it.  My 8 month old loves all electric cords. I needed something to protect her. For the past week this has been working.Only one side of it can I get a big 3 prong plug into it. I only need 2 openings to get in and out of so it hasn't presented itself as a major problem yet. I would purchase another one of these.
We have several surge protectors throughout the house and these covers fit them well and protect the plugs and open outlets.  They do their job well.I have not tried to wall mount.
What a great idea, to protect your power strip.  Wish i had one of these growing up and could have prevented a lot of nights being sent to my room without dinner.
I bought this power strip cover to protect my toddler from the power strip we have under a chest in our living room. The design is sturdy and fits our power strip perfectly, it is also easy to put  together. But it has two big minuses:1. Its height. The wires can bend but this is about 1 inch higher than the plugs, so if you want this to go under a piece of furniture you may want to consider whether it fits under or not. It barely fits under our chest.2. THE REAL ISSUE: The width of the slot through which the cables come out. MY TODDLER's HAND AND A PORTION OF HIS ARM fit through the slot perfectly, so he can reach the outlets AND the switch of the power cord. What is the point of this item? We just hope, at this point, that it will be a further discouragement--and since the piece is all but wedged under the chest, we will get to him before he can pull the thing close enough to stick his little hand in. Hopefully we'll find something better soon.You can presumably use it by covering every unused outlet in the cord with outlet covers. Although the toddler will be able to reach in, he will probably not have the strength or dexterity to pull out the outlet covers while his hand movements are limited by this shell. This, of course, would not stop him/her from turning the switch off--in our case, this means resetting the clock and being without a phone for however long it takes us to notice the deed, among other bothers.In summary: buy it only if you mean to attach it to the wall. And if you are planning to do the wall, keep in mind that this is pretty big--like attaching a 1L bottle of soda to your wall, only it is a solid, ugly off-white contraption with wires spewing off it.
Does the job! It's huge. But, it has to be to fit everything in there. I'm just grateful someone made something like this to keep our kids safe from electrocution. :)
My 2 year old never cared about the power cord under my computer (that powers the router), but once she discovered the entire family's reaction to pressing that red button, she sure loved sneaking down there.  This stopped that instantly.
This has been a life saver! It has kept my now 18 month old son out of the plugs and safe and I could not be happier with this product!
This fits a very specific style of power strip. Fully straight, single row.
We have a in floor outlet under our love seat that we have a power strip attached to.  We didn't want to get rid of the power stripe because it runs my husbands laptop and the table lamp.  This is was the perfect solution.  It was easy to install and so far my 7 month old can not get into it!
I got this for my son's room and it would be fine except that most kid stuff has larger plugs that do not fit inside (for example for the wipes warmer).  If you are plugging in standard sizes only, it should work great.  We ended up not using it.
I have two very busy almost two year old twins who were fascinated with the power strip in their playroom. This cover isn't the most attractive thing, but works. They cannot reach into it or access anything, (not sure what hole people are talking about), and have left it alone.  It's about the size of a one liter soda bottle, and slides together/apart to extend the length. It is tall enough, but not quite long enough to secure together firmly on our extra long power strip. It still works however, and is the best solution I've found. Would recommend.
I bought this "neutral" color (off-white) cover (UPC 5218110409, model 10409A - I don't know how that differs from model 10409) andMommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Coverto compare the two.  Unlike that item, this cover is expandable from 9" to 13.5" in length.  The roughly-cylindrical compartment is about 3.5" wide and 4" high. The slot where the cords for the equipment come out is 5/8"-1" wide and a maximum of 10-3/4" long.  When closed, the hole for the power strip cord is 1-3/8" by 1/2".  Holes are provided in the base for wall mounting, but no accessories are provided.To open the thing, you press two tabs on the inner lower cover, then slide off the outer cover, then lift the inner top cover.  Place the power strip into the inner lower cover, then replace the inner top cover, then slide the inner cover into the outer cover.The plastic is stiffer compared with the Mommy's Helper model, but it also seems more brittle.  I don't like the fact that there is no way to flick the power strip switch without half-disassembling the thing. It can hold a wider and higher strip and transformers than the Mommy's Helper model by about 3/4" in either direction, which is nice. Buy this from Amazon.com!
Fits all of my cords (even my Apple cords) perfectly.  Works exactly as advertised.
So far this has worked well for us. It's not pretty but it is effective. Will update this is my son figures out how to take it apart.
This cover works well for my power strips -- all the ones in my house fit. Also, I like that it doesn't matter how big the plugs are that you have in the power strip, it holds them (those large converter plugs that won't fit is so many child proof products fit fine in this one.My child is 10 months and hasn't messed with these yet, so I can't say how they will hold up with a larger toddler. However, I was concerned she'd try to put her hand in the slot that cords come out of and that hasn't happened yet. You still have to manage how the cords coming out of this cover are child-proofed. There is some space to roll up excess slack and stuff it into the cover.
To bulky, not what I expected or needed. Needless to say I gave it to a family member that could use it in a different area. Would not buy again.
This is a little bigger than I thought it was gonna be, but it does the trick. It's big enough to hold my my chargers for phone, bluetooth, ect. I did knock off one star due to the hole where the cords come out of is juts a little too big. My son who is 18 months can fit his hand in this gap and  can almost reach the outlet.
These are a great idea but didn't work for me.  Our cords are thick and long and wouldn't fit inside the box.
Functional and easy to use.  They do the job.  They aren't the prettiest thing, but they work to keep my son safe, which is the most important.
We have busy almost-two year old twins who are fascinated with the many window blinds in our house. I didn't want to spend a fortune, but needed a quick fix. These did the trick, easy to install, and keep the cords just out of their reach. They do pop off from time to time, but are easily replaced. I've purchased several different brands, and they are all about the same. I wouldn't spend extra money on ones that claim to do better than this type.
Although the design of these is to wind the cord shorter, when a window is open and blinds are drawn the cord does get longer. I left a room for 30 seconds and came back to see that my son had pulled the cord down and had it wrapped around his neck. Terrifying. Although these do pop open easily, they most definitely did not pop open from the pressure of a child's neck which I find to be a SERIOUS design flaw. From a company named Safety 1st - back to the drawing board on these!
I was kinda exceptional when I saw it and the the adhesive pad idea wasn't  that appealing to me for your oven door, but I gotta tell, it works and it works surprisingly good ..
This item won't attach to a regular stove because the adhesive won't stick to the sides.  Also, it comes unlocked too easily if you can manage to get it to stick to the oven.
We love this oven lock. It does what it is supposed to and the adhesive seems to be working extremely well. It was hard to attach at first because there are three pieces and with only two hands it's hard to hold all the pieces where they need to go. It doesn't get too hot to touch when the oven is on, which is great so that I can have it locked while I'm cooking and then unlock it without getting burned to take the food out.
My husband yanked hard enough on the oven door to pop this off. I don't think a baby or toddler could have managed it, though.
I do not reccomend this product at all! It did not stick well, and my 11 mo old daughter popped it off the first time she pulled on the oven door!
I LOVE these things! They work great and I love that you can't see them or my child can not get his fingers stuck in anything! They took about 30 minutes to install and they are amazing!
Love these. Not the easiest to install and they may take a little getting used to, but so worth it! They are really secure and do not interfere with the appearance of your cabinets. Would recommend in a heartbeat!
Even though the Tot Lok is a bit pricey, it's well worth the money.My daughter's room has a cabinet that has 2 doors with an open shelf space between them.  We didn't want her to have access to the cabinets, as we store her nicer books in the cabinets.  We tried several different methods of keeping her out of the cabinet doors.  I could spend several minutes rigging up what I thought would be a kid-proof barrier, only to have my daughter get into the cabinets within minutes.I found the Tot Loks one day when we were looking at child proof products, and boy, do I wish we had found them sooner.  These things are great.  After a lengthy install process - my hubby is a do-it-yourself handyman type and it still took awhile to install - our daughter can no longer get into the cabinets.I would highly recommend these to anyone who needs to keep kiddos (or even pets) out of cabinets.  Just don't lose the "key" or lock it inside the cabinet!
The locks are great. The only tricky part was installing them b/c if you don't drill far enough, the magents won't line up when you use the key on the other side and it won't work. I also could not flip the red bar to disengage it. I would recommend these b/c they work and with the key...they're almost even adult proof.
We used other types of latches, such as the ones that you push down and the ones that you squeeze and pull apart. Not toddler proof! We bought these magnet latches to put on our drawers in the kitchen and what a dream!! Another reviewer suggested two keys. Definitely. We only have one and are going to purchase another. Small price to pay for security. The thing I like about these is that if your little one is out of the house for the day, or they outgrow them, meaning they are old enough to be safe around knives and such, you can fix them where they don't require the key!  One drawback: If you have a double-wide or single-wide mobile home, you will have to do some modifications to your drawers to get them to work. My husband spent an entire evening working on three drawers due to the modifications needing to be made for them to work correctly for our drawers. After it was all done, it works perfectly. Also, a small price to pay for the security of my little angel. Do yourself a favor and invest a little money and get these latches!!!!
I feel bad that some people have had such a poor experience with this lock.  We on the other hand love these locks.  We bought our first set 7 years ago to use with our first child.  One set of Grandparents use them and an aunt too.  I am just about to get a second set because we have a new crawler and I want to put them on the bathroom cabinets.  They are a bit expensive but you will never need to buy locks again.  We prefer to leave our on at all times (even when our children don't need the cabinets locked anymore) because they are easy to turn off (just a flip of the red tab inside the cabinet) that way they are there whenever you have little ones visiting your home.  We have never split a cabinet and we don't think it takes that much longer to install then any other cabinet locks.  You will have to drill in you cupboard doors but your little one(s) will be protected.  It leaves no room for fingers to get pinched either.  If you do happen to lose your lock you can buy a strong magnet from your home improvement store and still get it open.  We like to keep our lock on the metal frame by the kitchen window above the sink.  Good luck whatever you decide.
This is simply a great product.  It is installed inside the cabinet so there is nothing to see from the front.  The newer models work even easier than the original ones we purchased years ago.  They open easily when the magnet is put near (don't even need to touch the cabinet door).  We use these in several places over the house and love the convenience, but piece of mind it gives.  They are also pretty strong - our 3 1/2 year old pulls and tries to open sometimes and has not broken or pulled open any drawer.NOTE - The old version needed a drill to make a small hole on the lock which sits inside the door, but the newer ones like this no longer require that hole to be made. These work better and are easier to install - just need a screwdriver and a few minutes.
We installed these to keep the kids out of the knife drawers.  They worked well at first but had a learning curve.  Visitors to the house found it impossible to work, because we had to have the magnet positioned just so.  That is actually a good safety feature, because the kids know the magnet opens the drawers and would attempt to open the drawers when they get their hands on the magnet.As far as keeping the kids out, it worked well.  I'd say it's been in our drawer for about six years.  We no longer use it and it hasn't worked well for about a year or so.  The magnet no longer unlatches the lock and we can't get into the drawer.This is a good lock, but require the willingness to drill into the woodwork of your cabinets.  It takes work for people to learn.  I think it should have lasted longer than five years, but maybe that's all most people need.  4 stars for the fact that it does what it's designed to do but not 5 stars, because it has issues.
This sounded good in theory, but didn't work at all.  They were correctly installed by my husband, but the magnet is just not strong enough to get it to open.  It was a waste of money for our cabinets.  It may work if you have the thinner particle board cabinets, but it definitely didn't work through our solid wood cabinets.
Love these, my son can not open anything now. Everything is totally safe in our home now because of these
I really love this set of clippers. After trying many different brands and styles - this is the one that we love. The blades are dull enough that they do not clip skin but sharp enough to cut sharp little nails. My baby's grow quickly so these clippers are used often. I like that the grip it small enough to fit in my hand easily but not too big to make me clumsy.I love the grip, that it moves with me and keeps me stable so that I only clip nails. It will not work for big people nails, which is nice - it means I can always find it when I need!I highly recommend these clippers to caregivers of infants and toddlers. Hands down my favorite clippers - perfect on the pocketbook too!
No brainer, makes it easy to cut my children's nails.Doesn't get lost easily. Easy to clean. Great grip .
Easy to hold and easy to use, we love it and it helps stop our son from scratching his face up at night.
The extra add-on is awesome for long-fingered parents! My whole family have ten mile long limbs, which includes incredibly long fingers so having that extra knobby thing attached to the nail clippers to hold onto makes it much less scary to bring a sharp object to your babies fingers.I suggest you ALWAYS cut their nails when they're sleeping, though. Haha
I received a different nail clipper as a baby shower gift. It had a plastic cover over the top of the cutting end of the clipper, similar to this one, but with a plain white handle instead of the cute bumble bee:Sassy: Bumble Bee Nail Clippers. It was terrible. I couldn't see my baby's finger nails at all and it wasn't sharp enough.Then I used this Safety 1st Nail Clipper at my mother's house. It was so much easier to use than the other one. The size is perfect for her little fingers. I could easily see my baby's nails and clip them without fear of cutting her. The handle fits nicely in my hand. And the blade is sharp enough to cut the nail off in one clip. I bought one for myself and it's the only one I'll use now.
I'm FTM and just used on my 5 days old baby-works perfectly. Not bulky, sharp and great quality. Highly recommended.
We had the Summer Infant clippers first.  They came in a two-pack, with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper.  Neither one worked well.  The larger of the two didn't work at all.  These Safety First clippers cut every time.  For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby's nails, you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut.  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!These work every time.
Clipping baby nails is one of the most stressful things. This nail clipper is small, but handles very well and the thicker handles make it an easier process. Well-made... we have been using ours for over 2 years without problems.
These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago.  I tried to trim my 3 month old son's nails, granted he is the fidgeting type.  Just as I was about to clip one of his nails, he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger.  His finger bled, my son cried and I panicked.  Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage.  But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company.  They are VERY safe.  I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents.  I shudder to think of using nail clippers again, especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails.
I know that every doctor says an oral temperature doesn't count, you have to take a rectal one.  But seriously, I hate taking my sons rectal temperature.  It is gross, he is squirming around.  Yuck.  This is so much easier. You pop it in their mouth, couple of seconds later, you have your temperature.  I have found it to be really accurate, unlike the ear one, which reads completely different on each ear.  Plus it is so small I bought a second one for our diaper bag.  Super convenient!
When I bought this item, I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby's temperature.  I use this thermometer only on occasion.  It's convenient, but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached.  It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long.  It's getting harder for my baby to accept this "pacifier", now that she is on the larger, 6-month-plus sized pacifiers.  Also, check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings: our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life.
The nipple on this thing is HUGE and pretty hard so I don't think it would work for most babies because it would gag them and they probably just wouldn't like it. I've tried this in my mouth, it isn't comfortable like regular pacifiers at all and it took so long to reach a temperature I took it out of my mouth before it was done, this was over 2 minutes so I don't even know if this thing is accurate at all.My girls were preemies and this was WAY too big for them. I've tried to use this thing many different times and my girls always spit it right out, even if I tried to hold it there they would push it out with their tongue, they HATE it. My girls are currently 14 months old and love their Binky pacifiers but I've tried to get them to use this to take their temps several times and they make a face & push it right out.My girls HATE & have always hated having their temperature taken under the arm pit but they do not mind it taken rectally, it IS very easy and the most accurate. I use an Exergen Temperal for when they are sleeping because it is accurate enough to let me know if they have a temp and if it is a high temp. If it shows they have a higher temp then I get them up and take their temp rectally to make sure I get the most accurate temperature. I recommend the Vicks Rectal Thermometer for that.I think companies make products like the pacifier thermometer because as new parents it sounds like a good idea but in reality, they just don't work and I'm sure your Dr will tell you the same thing.
I never wanted a tub because I was not impressed with anything I found but my sister got me this as a shower gift. I just don't think baby is comfortable in it. His leg was all scrunched up, his head fell to one side (unpadded, by the way), and it was hard to fit it over my bathroom sink because it's a small round thing. Anyway, before I had the baby, I bought my husband a bath head cushion (the kind you blow up) from Target which he never used (too girly I guess). Turns out it is the perfect cushion (it has suction cups) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths. It has grooves so baby's head doesn't flop everywhere. I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body. The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back. He just lies on the soft terry cloth. It's perfect.
This tub has proven very handy.  My son got his first bath in it at only 3 days old.  I admit, that was a little tricky.  However, in no time we had it down and I was able to bathe him easily anywhere.  Usually we take the bath on his bedroom floor.  I like the portability and the fact that it can fold up and fit under the bathroom counter, since his bathroom is also the guest bathroom.  I also like the little section in the front.  That's where I put the soapy water.  It's easy to rinse him off with a little watering can.  The tub has been great, but now that my son is 17 lbs. it's getting small.  I will be looking for another bath aid soon, but I'll miss this handy tub.
This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done.  However:-it does not hold a lot of water, so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is:-it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap, wash cloth, or toys
We first saw this fold-up infant tub in the NICU unit where our baby stayed for her first 4 weeks.  Its ability to be easily stored was a big plus in the hospital, as well as at home.  The NICU nurse recommended that we line any infant tub with one of those baby bath sponges (ours is yellow and in the shape of a bear).  We use our tub in the kitchen sink.  Leaks, pinches and mildew have never been a problem.  Oddly enough, we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards (once she could hold up her head).  This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair.  We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby's torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold.  Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months, but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months.  Our baby loves bath time!- Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds.  We have used this infant tub up until this point and are just now graduating to the big tub.  This fold-up tub was a great purchase for us!
I have been using this tub since my sons very first bath. At first he hated to take a bath and now he loves it. I love the fact that it folds up very easily and will fit into a closet when folded. I have never had a problem with it growing mold or smelling musty. After the bath I wipe it dry with a towel fold it up and put it in the closet. I also have a newborn to toddler tub, which is very large and I have nowhere to store it.I have never had a problem with it leaking. As long as you don't overfill it, it works just fine. I find this tub to be better than the more expensive ones. The only problem I have is that my six month old son is too big for this tub, but at $12.99, is that really such a big deal? I feel I got my moneys worth out of it. If you are looking for a tub that is safe and easy to store I recommend this one.
This tub is incredible for a newborn. It's non-skid surface really helps hold baby in place, and it's size makes it very easy to bathe your baby. It folds up nicely & we stored it under the bathroom sink. However, after a couple of months, we moved our daughter into a bigger tub so that she could kick her feet & move around more. I will definitely use this tub again for our next newborn!
If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you... except that you'll only use it for 3 months  because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space.  As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that.  And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at.  Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)
We have limited storage so this works great & fits in the sink perfectly.  Never have a problem with leaking either.
I used this tub with my son and boy do I miss it! We have the newborn-to-toddler tub with daughter and it's bulky, takes up tons of room and is no different than this one other than it doesn't fold up. I would much rather have the fold-up than the one we have now. They both work and get the job done but for space reasons being able to fold it and put out of the way is much nicer IMO...
I bought this tub without doing any research on it. I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby. Well, I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning. Also, I have yet to get it to shrink, so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time. The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller, but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick. However, that causes him to slide down the sling and it's quite hard where the sling ends, so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back. Also, it just doesn't seem to hold water. I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out. All in all, I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks, I am getting another one.
I'm shocked by all of the other reviews on this particular product.  Many complain that it's too small for their sink...hello!!!  It wasn't made for a SINK.  Anyway,...I love this tub.  I wouldn't want any other one.  It was the most convenient when my son needed to be on the sling =perfect=, and now that he's sitting up,... it's even more convenient.  Please ignore the negative reviews and I highly consider buying this product.  It may be the only tub you will buy in you child' early stages.
We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old. I have not had any problems with the tub leaking. But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times. I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies. The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body. It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help. It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub. I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies.
We love this tub.  We have been using it since our daughter's first bath.  It was tough to pop the tub into the expanded version, but that tight fit means it won't leak.  If you don't pop it together right it will leak.  We leave it set up in the tub when not in use so it's not really taking up any vital space.  Our daughter seems to like the sling.  She's four months old now and didn't cry even during her first bath.3/06 - We're now using this tub on child #2.  Still no problems.  This child likes it too.  Between the two girls we've been using this tub for 22 mo.  It has never leaked, not once.
Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open! I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want! Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child. And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly. Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day....got another brand....
This was terrible. It leaked all over the place. Finally my husband put silicone all around it which helped. Save your money & buy the cheap $10 one that's one piece.
It's been 5 months aleady and we've had no troubles at all.  It leaked the first time we used it because I didn't snap the locks into place all the way. My boys are quite big for their age, and they love to kick their legs and splash around. There is plenty of room for that.  In the beginning I put the tub on my bathroom counter, but when they started splashing water all over the place, I put this tub in our regular bath. I don't use the sling anymore, but it wasn't a problem when we did.
I've used this tub since my baby was born 6 months ago. There are far more things I dislike about it than like.I liked the sling. I used it alone in the kitchen sink.I disliked the sling in the tub. I felt it did not fasten securely to the tub and there wasn't enough cushioning for his head and bottom. My son now sits up on his own but I feel he can slip too easily in this tub.
I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks. This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week. I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water. So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks. Really, who wants a tub that leaks???? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub....so we are in an awkward transition phase. a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with. I wouldn't buy this tub.
It leaks every time I use it. It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.  I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.  I love the sling, but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.  If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside, it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.  I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using, I should have.  I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.  Buy at your own risk.
Enough said.
My mom bought this for us after she decided that the bath chair we already owned was not good enough.  This has been the best bathtub we could have ever wanted!  The newborn sling is nice, and lets baby have contact with the water without feeling overwhelmed.  Our baby didn't really like bath time until he could sit up by himself, and at that point this bath tub became a necessity.  Baby loves to explore the tub, and the secure bath ring helps keep him safely and securely in one place.  He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way, too!  I especially like it because I don't have to worry about him slipping under the water accidentally if I look away for a second to get his towel ready or something.  We had a problem with leaking at first, too, but once we read the instructions and pushed the bottom down securely, we haven't had a problem since.
I was never fond of this even with the first use.  The baby sling never stayed in place and i was constantly adjusting the sling and baby.  When i moved to the bath ring it's plastic edges are sharp and usually scratched him while he moved around.  It doesn't colapse or open easily leaving a large tub.  The only time i was happy with it was once he was old enough to sit in the full tub which is when this isn't needed.
Not sure why this got bad reviews.  There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position, if you don't snap it in right, it will leak.  But once we figured that out we had no problems.  We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem.  Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe.  Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub, great value!
I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower.  I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub.  Wrong!!  First of all, the tub leaks.  You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide.  My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy.  The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
This tub was the worst! Talk about making your job harder than it already is! It leaks, the sling hardly stays in place, it takes up so much space, and you have to use it in the tub anyways. It is more trouble than it is worth.
I bought this tub without reading any reviews (I research everything before I buy) and this has been the best tub by far! So far, in my 7 months of motherhood I have been through four tubs (this being the 5th). I had a little sponge bath when he was first born...I knew it would not work for any extend about of time but it did the trick when we were waiting for his belly buttons stump to fall off. When he out grew that I bought the Safer Bather by leachco based on reviews and I was not all that impressed... My little guy got to cold and it just was not that great. We received the four stage bath system and it was horrible the baby just did not fit in it right. Therefore, I upgraded to the leachco bath ring...once again nothing but disappointment. I was resolved to washing the baby in the sink, but at 7 months that was just too hard for me to do alone; he was slippery and squirmy just wanting to play! I happened to be out at Toy's r us and they were having a sale so I picked up the tub thinking what the heck lets see if this works. So far, it has been great. No leaks, he is very secure (obviously, you stay with them) and it is so simple clean. My only issue is the tub is large and we have a small bathroom. I am 5 months pregnant with my second and cannot wait to use the sling with the next baby. By far this is one of the best baby items I own! Five stars from me!
We registered for this tub, before doing any research.  Big mistake.  As a newborn, I used the sling to bathe my son.  As he got bigger, I put the sling into the tub (2nd way of the 4-1 system).  Bath time became a pain.  My son kept sliding down, even with one hand on him at all times.  He didn't really seem to enjoy it either.  Finally, after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath.  LOVE IT!!!!!  From day one my son had a great time in his new (huge) tub.  He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub, with no slipping.  He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash.  We've had it over a month, I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub.
I used this bath for the first 3 months and it was great when using the sling, but when my son got too big for the sling and was sitting up, we tried the sitting position. But my son would just slip down and would cry because it was uncomfortable for him. I would not recommend this bath tub. There are other tubs with slings that are much better.
This tub is okay, but not the best there is.  Our son is 3 months old and fairly long, 25 inches.  He can't sit on is own yet, so has to lay on the sling.  He loves to kick and splash and doesn't have the room he needs.  He also slips down the sling frequently.  There's got to be something better...
When our son started rolling into chairs, we knew we needed something to keep him safe.  This play yard fits great in our living room, yet there's plenty of room for him to roll around in all directions.  Also, I like that it's see-thru.  You can see  your baby (and he can see you) from across the room.  I don't care that it's not the most attractive thing.  It was affordable and it does the job.  And when our son starts crawling, we can completely close it and know that he won't be able to sneak off.  One suggestion I would make to the manufacturer though would be to pad or provide padding around the bottom, about six inches high.  My son falls asleep with his head on the edge all the time (NOT very comfortable), and when I move him away from it, he wakes up.  It'd be nice to not have to move him.
Superyard XT is an excellent product for child containment, providing exactly the protection a parent desires for outdoor play. It isn't a very large gate- even when fully extended, it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen. But it offers enough space to keep one or two kids (and their toys) safely occupied.Superyard XT holds up well and I have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems. It is very easy to clean and to transport. The panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still. The panels do not fold completely flat- they do have some thickness, so don't expect this gate to fit into a tiny space. It needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together.The panels on Superyard XT are not very tall and because of this, the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age. As children get older, they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down, making it impractical as a containment device. But the shorter height has one clear advantage: It makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over. There is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside.Superyard XT is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly. The gates cannot be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner. Each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy. Placed in a straight line, the gate cannot resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push.The only complaint I have with Superyard XT is the small space it covers. With the limited space, some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate. Depending on the number of toys your kids have, one child might be all that will fit. This is why I strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit. This kit consists of two additional panels and while this doesn't sound like much, it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems.Overall, Superyard XT is a very good gate for child or pet containment. I brushed it off when I first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use, marketed solely to take our hard earned money. But now that I own the Superyard, I cannot imagine life without this containment device. It offers kids a place to play where they are well- protected, giving parents some much needed peace of mind.
This has system has given me peace or mind. I know my grand daughter is safe while she is entertaining herself. Great product, very study.
We purchased this the moment i saw my son fell and landed flat on the floor hitting the bottom corners of our entertainment center & computer table.  It gave him a bad bruise on his forehead, and worst of all a very traumatic cry of his life at 8 months.  Now that we enclosed our entertainment center along with our computer table with this gate, we not only protected him from some more bad falls, but also kept him away from other stuffs (cds/dvds, remote controls, powersurge outlet and so on) we don't want him to play with.  Definitely, a very sturdy gate that won't just fall apart when pulled or tagged by my son, now 14 months.  It doesn't even encourage him to climb up on its diagonal shaped railings, no matter how much he tries to.  I say, its much cheaper too to invest on gates rather than on childproofing device with adhesives that don't actually work, and other devices that are not only childproof but adult proof as well.  A great investment for a lifelong use.
We now own two of these gates/yards. We originally purchased the yard to wrap around our stone wall/fireplace. The wall was too "freeform" to use regular 90-degree and straight-edge padding, so we figured by snaking this yard around the fireplace and entertainment center we'd pretty well babyproof the whole living room. Currently we are using one gate to block off the bottom of the stairs and one at the top (we're in a rental home and cannot bolt the sturdier ones to the wall). We use them as a deterant and NOT as a "babysitter." Our daughter is always supervised, but it's nice to have a "split second accident preventer." In other words, it would take her some time to move the gate and go around it, by which time we would have caught her red-handed. Our first gate made it through a cross-country move with "Break and Dent Van Lines" with no issues...if only all our items would have been so durable. Anyway, well worth the cost for a variety of uses!
This is a stay-at-home mom's lifesaver!As my little boy (now 9 months) has become moremobile, this product has helped tremendously.It has broadened his world but in an enclosed space.We keep his play yard in a corner within the superyard, in the children's playroom.He never gets tired of it. He can play with his toys,while I check my email, do the laundry and watch him at the same time. He loves it!He can crawl or cruise within his area and can see me whilehe plays. It's great that you can adjust the individual pieces.I recommend buying the extra parts to have a larger space for baby to roam in. It never hurts to have extra, in case one breaks. Great product! We have great fun playing in it together!
I got this from a friend whose son had outgrown it. It has been wonderful. We use it both indoors and out. Outdoors it's good for keeping and busy infant or toddler in one place so you can do yard work or relax without having to chase them around. It is especially handy in the backyard since we have a pool. I just put a few toys inside it with my son and he's happy for a while. We don't have a playpen so we use this inside as well when we need to make sure he stays out of harms way for a few minutes. We even use it for the dog when she sleeps inside at night because otherwise she chews on everything in the house while we're sleeping. It folds easily and stores great under the bed.
I was initially given this product as a gift for my 9 pound chihuahua. It's great in the sense that it contains him very well. He is very active and likes to jump very high, but he can not jump over the gate. He tries to push the gate in attempt to escape but the gate does not move. The gate is high enough so that he can not jump over. It contains his crate, wee-wee pad and food bowl with plenty of room for him to play around in. I bought a second one to use as a gate to keep him from going up our stairs. Very sturdy product and we plan on using this also when we have kids. One drawback is the gate is a little difficult to open at times in case you want to just walk in. But I guess that is the good thing also so who ever you have inside can't get out.
I recommend getting the extension that goes with this gate to make it big enough.  Our baby never liked to be penned in anywhere, but we use it to gate off the "band area" of the basement.  It doesn't need to be connected to itself to function well.  If you do plan to connect it in an enclosable shape, it takes a little getting used to the connection mechanism.  My husband has no problem with it at all.  It's very versatile, and I recommend it.
It holds position nicely.  I feel comfortable that my 10 month old isnt going to tip the whole thing over due to it being substantial in weight.But when it comes down to it, I dont know if I would buy it again for more than 35$.
This was great for helping me keep an eye on my little one while I worked. I was working from home, and most days I was upstairs and on the computer. Once she could crawl, she started crawling toward everything dangerous. The litter box, the stairs, plugs, you name it, she found a way to get to it. I bought this and it was great! We even purchased the extension kit, so she basically had the whole room, yet was contained. My oldest son even liked to get in with her to play so she was never &quot;lonely&quot;.I also used this outdoors a lot during summer months. My family is big on campfires and cookouts and this was a great way to ensure her safety, yet not have her confined to a play pen!
We bought this instead of the Playzone because it was cheaper. We bought the Superyard XT to use as a playpen area for our son. The Superyard is fantastic when it comes to size and it very sturdy if you mount it to the wall or bolt it into the floors but we prefer not to put holes all over the walls or into our concrete slab. So we did not get to enjoy the gates fullest potential.The Good:1. Very tall2. Has options available to make it sturdy and permanent in placement.3. Able to see though the gates, great for both parent and child.4. Easy to fold up (with some elbow grease)5. Very Very easy to store away.6. White color, very nice can match just about anything.7. Somewhat easy to wash (not like the plastic walls on the Playzone - you just wipe clean), we had to take the gate into the yard and rinse it off with the water hose.8. If it is not bolted into the walls it is quick and easy to take down for more space verses other products such as the Playzone are pretty permantent once in place (they are just too big and bulky)All in all I gave the Superyard XT 4 stars because it has options to make it as sturdy as the more expensive ones out there, but the more expensive ones do not require screws, or holes to your home to complete the job. If you want to use the Superyard as an extensive gate to block entranceways this gate is fantastic in every way. If you are buying to use as a Playyard, then buy the Playzone if you have an extra fifty bucks.
I began using this when my first daughter began to crawl.  I liked that it was bigger than any playpen or playyard and could accommodate my growing daughter as well as her toys.  It is easy to put together and I purchased an additional section to make it even larger.  We have used it at home, at the beach, in the yard and as a barrier for both the Christmas tree and pellet (wood) stove to keep our little ones safe.
My baby seems to really like this cube. He loves watching the flashing lights and hearing the music. The reason I did not give it five stars is because the instruments do all sound very similar and a bit electronic sounding, but other than that not that annoying of electronic toy.
We bought this when our baby was sitting with support and initially she was into the soft edges to chew on and later on she found interest in hitting the cube for playing music. It's been many months since we bought this and baby is still interested in it. This is probably the only toy she reaches for over and over, and she never seems to get tired of it. Worth the $$.
Both of my twins LOVE this toy! I really like how you can add/subtract the different instruments as the song plays. I did find it interesting that they enjoy one of the songs more than others and will keep pressing the orchestra button until they find the song the like. I think it's a good way to start to introduce them to music.
I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy...  My 1yo & 3yo love it.  BUT it has an issue with batteries!  When it arrived (with included batteries in a "try me" box), the batteries were dead.  It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week.  When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful!  Perhaps we got a defective one.  I don't know.  I hope this isn't happening to others.
I didn't buy this for my son because some reviews said the sounds weren't true to the instrument.  I'm a very musical person, so I'm picky about these things.  I am SO GLAD someone bought this for my son.My son is 5 months old.  He is entertained by this toy (so am I).  He doesn't get the concept of the different instruments, and adding/subtracting the instruments.  But, he does press the buttons himself.  The lights just add to the experience.I don't think the sounds are that far off.  It's a baby toy remember.  I like the choices of instruments - violin, piano, harp, flute & French horn - partly because I play three of those.It cycles through 8 songs (not all Mozart as implied by the name).  Unfortunately, it will only cycle through the songs by pressing the Orchestra button multiple times.  It would be nice to cycle through them only using one instrument.
great item, my baby loves the music, i love it as well pressing all the buttons, i would def. recommend this item.
Seriously, we have a top 5 list of must bring/have with us when we go anywhere, and this is one. My MIL freaked out when it ran out of batteries. It's that good. I'm not even sure why, but the baby becomes obsessed with the different instruments and the sounds. And it plays a lot of tunes-excellent purchase.
This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn't seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it.
My 6 month old LOVES this toy!I was thrilled when he went for it immediately in his playpen and was tap, tap, tapping the buttons - he knew the music should come from this tapping, but I had turned it off!  I do think the on-off switch is a blessing for the parents.  But the music is really pleasant, unlike so many toys.Of course the music is electronic, and I think that would be my only complaint.  I'm a very amateur violinist and would like the violin button to truly sound like strings but instead it's very electronic.However, the piano and French horn are quite good facsimiles.Research tells us that early introduction of classical music to children aids in their developing cognitive abilities.  This is a great way to make music fun for kids and I think all would enjoy this toy.
My 10 month old daughter loves this toy and we also like the music it plays. The music is soothing and not annoying like many other toys. Also, it is a great size to travel with for road trips. Definitely a toy we recommend. We have also given it as a gift and the one year old loves it.
I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children.  I never saw any of them properly engage with it.  They'd pull it out, bang it a couple of times (starting up 2 different sounds) and then get bored and crawl away.  It was the one toy I knew I'd never buy for my children.
This toy is great.  Not annoying and definitely a plus that there is an on/off switch.  My 7 month old figured it out pretty quickly and loves to bang, roll and chew on the thing.  She even gets excited when the music picks up and wiggles around.  Well worth the money.
My 9 month old loves this musical cube. It has a nice selection of music. It does not have a volume switch so it can be rather loud.  Overall, I'd recommend it for your little one.
This is just the biggest hit with the grandchildren and their parents probably thanks to Mozart.  The children love it and it is so simple and unobtrusive.  The music is pleasant.  The on and off switch is easy. It stack and stores!
I got this for my granddaughter's first birthday and we both love it! We both keep pushing the instruments to hear more music. I see why it is one of the most popular infant and toddler toys. Grandmas loves to play with it too!
Buy it! Buttons are nice and soft enough that baby can activate them. She carries this around everywhere. Just watch the toes as it is a bit heavy.
My daughter LOVES this toy.We first gave it to her at 6 months for Christmas, which was too early. She wasn't strong enough to push the button herself, so she didn't really like it. Around 8 months or so, she started liking it. The more she figures out how it works, the more the likes it. At 11 months, she plays with it all the time. Now she's strong enough to lift it, so she hands it to us to play.
I know it says that this is for older babies but my daughter loves looking at the blinking lights and listening to the music. A piece of advice: it took me a little while to figure out that you had to press the orchestra button a few times to change the song. Before I figured this out, the same song was driving me crazy! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have a volume control button. It is quite loud and I sometimes wish I can make it lower.
The buttons are easy for the baby to find and the music isn't super annoying for the parents.  Definitely a good toy.
My 4-5 month old baby loves this toy.  It is very easy to press the buttons and activate the sounds, so even very young, uncoordinated babies can get this toy to make noise.  As she gets older, she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors.  For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.  Eventually, we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy, where they still are (and we hope they stay there).  There seems to be no way to remove them entirely.
This is a great transitional toy. We've had it since my son was tiny - as an infant, he liked to look at the lights and colors. At 18 months, he dances to the music and loves pressing the buttons. I don't think he fully gets the concept of adding and removing instruments to the orchestra yet, so once he figures that out, we'll have many more months of fun with the music cube. The music is pleasant - my only complaint is that it only has one volume setting.One word of caution, if you have a climber - this toy makes a great stepping stool for toddlers who like to climb out of their cribs. :)We love the music cube - highly recommend it!
My husband, son and I all LOVE this toy. My niece had it before, so I knew it was a must-have with my little guy already. I love that he (1 year old) can be exposed to fun classical music with a toy that engages him. He loves that it all lights up (when the buttons on any side are pressed) and he has fun pressing the buttons on the different sides and seeing and hearing the difference it makes (pressing one side engages or unengages the instrument during the song).  An added BIG PLUS for parents - it does have an "off" switch. :)  SO key, even for those of us who appreciate the value and fun of noisy kiddo toys... there is still a time/place for quiet.Great, fun toy. :)
My one year old son has played with this toy since he was 6 months old and it still entertains him.  While the instruments do sound a bit synthetic, the toy still provides an introduction to different instruments and how multiple instruments can create a complex music piece.
My son loves to dance to music now. He received this for his 1st birthday and it was an instant hit. He quickly learn how to work it and he still loves to play with it at 20 months old.
My niece absolutely loved this product and its not at all annoying! She loves playing with the lights and mom and dad don't have to listen to annoying music!
My daughter got this when she was 3 months old and it was one of her favorite toys. She'd kick her legs to turn the music on and off. At 3.5 she still loves it and she sits and plays with it along with her 9 month old brother now.
I bought it for my love, it's very nice as the description, my girl loves that a lot. it's a good toy.
I am so glad I read the reviews and purchased the original Embryonics one instead of the one made by Munchkin. The sound difference is amazing. I've heard the Munchkin one play in person and it sounds like it is dying and about to run out of batteries. Seriously save yourself some money and buy an original one (even if it's used). I got mine on ebay.
What a GREAT musical toy! I highly recommend it. Our kid loves it, plays with it all of the time.
Fine toy, nice sound.  Much better than most other musical toys.  But I can't give it to my son yet as I can't seem to get these damned wires from the packaging out of the toy.  They are threaded through these tiny holes in the product and I haven't yet gone out to get pliers as someone else suggested.  You shouldn't need pliers to free a toy from its packaging.  Obviously the manufacturer didn't receive the memo that we are pushing for frustration free packaging. I even took out the screws that access the battery pack (which I am quite impressed with as well), hoping to access where the wires are stuck.  No luck.  If they just used regular string, it would easily come out, but these plastic coated wires are too stiff to pull through in the manner that they have put them.
After looking for a musical toy that was not annoying, off-key or obnoxious, we discovered this.  Plays several songs by Mozart; baby can play a song with all instruments at once by pressing "orchestra" or one at a time.  Baby can also turn off instruments one at a time. The instruments are clearly synthesized, but still, the quality is not bad and I could listen to it for long periods of time.  I have yet to be annoyed by this toy.  In fact, I may have to buy two - my twins fight over it constantly!  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a little bit loud.  I wish there was a volume control.
I bought this but my little one is definitely not old enough yet to grasp the concept...but she is getting there and lives to play with it, and so do I! Not annoying but very good tones. Love it, bought one for my nephew and cousin too!
The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.  I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat.
Why can't manufacturers put a volume control on all toys or at least err on the side of being too quiet?  this toy is a great concept and plays great music, looks great, but is too loud.  espeically when my baby is playing with it right next to their ear.Unfortunately many other toys are too loud too, so this one is probably worth recommending to friends/family.  but it could be better.
My 6 month-old enjoys staring at the toy and listening to the music if I turn it on for him, so I probably enjoy this toy more than my child at the moment, but I'm sure that will change.  The problem for a young baby is that this toy is very dense, and the buttons require a significant amount of force to push.  If he kicks one of the buttons, that will be enough, but he doesn't really have enough force just from swatting at it (he'd probably have to lean onto it).  It's also too heavy for him to pick up.The music quality is very nice and I don't find it to be at all annoying (like many other electronic baby toys); the flute is probably the nicest sounding of the instruments.  The corners are also rubbery, so you don't need to worry about sharp edges.  I'm still giving it 5 stars because I think it will be a toy he'll enjoy more and more as he grows and becomes more able to interact with it on its own, but for a younger baby, you might want to look atBaby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Orchestra Musical Toy, which has a similar conceit.
I love that there is an off switch, and it would be very difficult for a baby to turn it on.  My baby received this as a Christmas gift, and she likes it quite a bit, hence the second star.  But why, oh why, didn't they put a volume switch on this thing though?!My older children like to turn this on to play with their little sister, and it is ok for the first few minutes, but it is so darned LOUD, I'm practically loosing my mind.  I have to take it away, so what is the point of having a toy that gets forgotten about in a cupboard somewhere?As for good points, there are lots of colors obviously, and baby can choose just one instrument or the whole orchestra sha-bang.  The individual instruments don't REALLY sound authentic, but it was a nice try. The musical arrangement was a nice choice, too.  But please MUNCHKIN, for the sanity of future parents receiving this as a gift, put a volume control on it!!!If you are looking for a great gift for a parent, seriously considerPlayskool Busy Poppin' Pals (Colors May Vary), it's lasted through 3 kids, six years, and still going strong.  It's nice and quiet, too.
I have read through some of the ridiculous low-star reviews and can't believe how anal people are.  This is a baby's toy for $20.  It's not a minature version of the New York Symphony stuffed into a $600 Bose music player, like some people are expecting.Since this is a child's toy, I think it's serves it's purpose well.  The music is clear.  The lights flash when the music plays.  I think it's neat that you can add or subtract musical instruments during the song that's playing so your baby can hear what each individual instrument sounds like.My daughter loves the toy.  It keeps her occupied for long periods of time and she's learning the names of each instrument and how they each sound both together in an orchestra and individually.The people who are expecting this to be something more than it is need to understand that the toy wasn't designed for their enjoyment.  The toy was designed for children.  And, in my opinion, it's an exceptional toy that will keep most children entertained which, in and of itself, is a blessing.
Sturdy toy, fun to push all the buttons. Sings 8 diff Mozart tunes and lights up. No assembly required just open the box and turn it on.
This music cube is a great idea, but unfortunately the sound quality is terrible. The violin doesn't sound at all like a violin. Overall it's very tinny and hard to listen to.
This toy keeps my 4-month old's attention for a while - she really seems to like the flashing lights as the music plays.I only wish there was a volume button on it - it seems a bit loud to me (and if it seems loud to me wouldn't it seem loud to the baby as well?), and I wish it weren't quite so heavy.  It will be a long time before my baby will be able to turn the cube or pick it up, for now it just sits on the floor between her legs and she's able to hit the buttons that are facing up/out.
my son has special needs. he is blind and cognitive delays. this isn't nearly as annoying as most toys.  it only gets annoying bc he bangs on it for hours on end. he loves it
Plays nice music that isnt to loud.  Item is smaller than I expected, but that is not a bad thing as it makes it easier for little ones to hold/carry.
This is such a great toy.  I have to knock one star off for volume control, it is entirely too loud and as I can see this has been a complaint before I can't believe they haven't adjusted it.  There is no way to put tape over any place to quiet it down due to it's construction so we use it during loud times as opposed to &#34;quiet&#34; times.
I hesitated to buy this after reading some of the reviews comparing it to the old Embryonics version. You see, I bought that version at a secondhand store back when my three-year-old was a baby. It was a great toy, but the battery compartment was hard to take off and put on without breaking it. One day we brought it to a friend's house, and someone else's kid somehow broke the battery cover in such a way that my attempts to fix it with super glue were futile. I went back to the secondhand store to find the other one I had seen on my initial visit, but I didn't find it. I was bummed because I had really liked it! I came to Amazon to discover that Munchkin now made the music box, but the reviews comparing the old one to the new one kept me from buying it.A little while ago, I decided I still really missed the toy, and I now had another baby who might enjoy it. Thus I bought it because I figured we could return it if it was really that bad.I honestly think that it is better than the old one! It has nicer colors, an improved battery compartment cover, and better synchronization of the instruments.The Embryonics version was purple and yellow and, in my opinion, kind of ugly. As you can see in the pictures, the Munchkin version is all different colors and visually appealing.The sound quality is just as good, and the batteries get used up a little more slowly in the Munchkin version. The battery compartment cover now has two screws (rather than a screw and a tab that put stress on the cover every time you had to put it back on) plus a pull-out box that contains the three batteries.On the Embryonics version, sometimes the instruments were out of sync. We had this problem from the start. It just seemed that one or two instruments were slightly behind the others. We've used our Munchkin version plenty but haven't yet run into this problem.I'm not sure why some other reviewers are knocking the sound quality (whether or not it's compared to the Embryonics version). This isn't an orchestra; it's a child's toy. It introduces them to some new music plus some musical instruments they might not encounter otherwise. Do the individual instruments sound like the real thing? Kind of. But again, it's a child's toy. The sound quality does tend to suffer as the batteries start to die, but that's to be expected. It gets quieter and flatter, like the instruments are slightly out of tune.I'm generally not a big fan of noise-making toys, especially ones that play music because the music tends to be very annoying. I don't find the music from this box annoying; in fact, it bothered me so little that I sought out this particular toy two years after throwing out the original, broken one.My only complaint is that I wish the box had a lower volume setting. The music can be a little loud, especially when it's got new batteries. That would probably help retain some battery life, too.Overall, my baby loves this toy, and my 3-year-old, who loved it as a baby, still loves it. They actually play with it together, which is rare. The older one recognizes the instruments and likes to show his younger brother what they are.Oh, and if you're like me and hesitated to buy this because it's supposedly crappy compared to the Embryonics version, fret not and just order it. You'll be glad you did, and if you disagree, pack it back up and return it.
My ten month old loves this toy. She is just learning to turn it over and press the different buttons to get the different sounds. It is quite heavy for her little arms though, so she does get frustrated at times. I find the music to be a little but too high-pitched for me, but it is better than many other musical toys we have had. Overall a great purchase.
This seems like a great toy for the musically inclined baby, my 5 month old likes looking at the flashing lights and trying to eat it the music doesn't seem too loud to me or out of tune,  perhaps that is a defect for the previous reviewer?  My son seems to love looking at it and pushing the buttons, I think once he is a bit older he might appreciate it more.  However I do agree it is a great book shelf toy too.  IT looks fantastic!
Got this early on but the baby appreciates it more now that she is six months. Music is more pleasant to adult ears than most other musical toys. At least I think so.

My son has this cube; i bought this as a gift for my sister's son...it is great. 6 decent songs and you can listen to individual instruments (and they only play their parts) or you can listen to the whole orchestra. Great for little ones that are learning "cause and effect."
I bought this for my 9 mo. old daughter for christmas.I love this toy.  There is an orchestra button on one side that starts a song or switches to another song.  Each song is a classical music track.  When a song is in play you can push the other sides of the cube to add or subtract instruments.  I think this is a fantastic toy that will get toddlers thinking about music.The best part of this toy is quality of the toy.  It is clear that the programmers put a lot of thought into creating it.  The instruments definitely sound true to what they should be.  You can very clearly tell the difference between the sound of the french horn, flute, piano, harp, and violin.  Each of the instruments plays a different part of a song and each instrument is playing a part "true" to what the instrument does in a real orchestra.  What I mean by this is that in an orchestra, a tuba doesn't just sound different than a flute, they perform different musical functions.  I love that this cube respects this concept.  The result is that the music is worth listening to and I am always happy when my daughter plays with this toy over other toys with less-pleasing music.I highly recommend this toy.
The coolest thing about this cube is that you can push the different sides to have that specific instrument play in the song. It's great for your kids learning to hear different songs. It also lights up and plays very nice classic type melodies vs the standard children's songs.
My six month old grandchild loves this even though she is still somewhat young to fully appreciate it. This is a great toy for infants and toddlers. Here is why:1. This cube stimulates touch, sight, and sound in a creative way. Each side of the cube has a different instrument and a different color: violin--yellow; harp--pink; french horn--orange; flute--purple; piano--green; orchestra--blue.2. When your child touches a side of the cube, it lights up and the instrument starts playing. Touch a second side, and the second instrument plays in sync with the first one (which is still playing), etc. If you want to hear everything at once, just hit the orchestra button.3. There are no sharp corners. Instead each corner is rounded and has yellow, purple, green and red colors.4. There is an easy on/off switch to conserve battery power when the cube is not in use.5. As the name indicates, the cube plays music from Mozart. I have read the most negative review complaining about the sound and that this cube is not as good as the original Embryonics cube. While I have not heard that cube, I have played Mozart pieces on the piano and also have CDs of various of his works, so I am familiar with his music. For a toddler the quality of the music on this cube is just fine, so don't let that negative review discourage you from buying this product.Bottom line: This is a well made quality toy.Update May 20, 2012: My now 16 month old granddaughter still loves to play with this.
I bought this magic cube about 2-3 months ago and at that time my baby wasn't really able to play with it. But now he's 6 months and he plays with the cube longer and longer. This is one of my baby's favorite toys now!
I only wish it had the real drum-snare sounds also added to it. This is a good buy. Recommend buying
I always read reviews on this website and the Babies R Us site before buying a product. This product got great reviews so I bought it - I was not disappointed.I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old. The music and flashing lights immediately captured his attention and, as he grew, he played with it more and more. I keep it in his playpen and it's easily his favorite toy (besides his exersaucer and jumperoo). It keeps him entertained longer than other toys.I like that it's easily washable and has soft rubber-like corners (so, if baby falls on it, no sharp or hard corners to scratch himself on).I also think the music is nice - nothing too annoying like a lot of toys out there. And, with the click of the "Orchestra" side, the song changes.So glad I bought this!Update 6/10: My son will be 12 months old this weekend and he STILL loves his Mozart Cube!
I bought this for our grandson for his 1st  birthday. He loves music and he loves his magic cube. It is easy for him to push and he figured out that each side makes a different sound really quick. It is very sturdy and the music quality is good for a toy. I would recommend it.
My kids enjoy this toy, however it's a little heavy and not easy to turn because the corners are mad of rubber and are a bit sticky on our wooden floor.  I do enjoy that the music is Mozart.
I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones!  If your kid is like mine, however, and likes to sit on the potty "unproductively" you might want to consider something a little more comfortable.  The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside.  While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic.  Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting.  Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around.  I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it wouldn't fall into the toilet with a toddler's wiggling around.  You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot.
I really like this potty seat, but it doesn't quite fit well on our elongated toilet. It works well enough, and the colors aren't as bright as they appear in photo nor is the design exactly the same. It's o.k. for the price. My daughter really wanted a red potty seat, but if I could do it again I would buy her a different brand.
We bought this potty seat to leave at her grandma's house,  and she loves it. She wouldnt go potty on the training potty for the longest time and as soon as we put this one on the big potty, she went #1 & #2 and is well on her way to being potty trained. I would put 6 stars if i could!
This does fit on an elongated toilet seat, but it slides around. It wouldn't dump my kid in or anything, but the slipping might startle a child. I may see if I can find some sort of anti-slip stickers. I did not bother with the splash guard, I just threw it out. It looked flimsy and unnecessary. My daughter loves the SpongeBob theme. I'm not so fond of the vinyl seat, as my daughter's hiney sticks to it and is a little uncomfortable when she gets up. But, it's cheap enough and serves its purpose - allowing my daughter to sit on the big potty without falling in.
We have 3 of these (1st was a gift; subsequent others purchased from Amazon after successful use). It is comfy padding (I presume comfy - the padding is quite thick and has some squish to it). The handles are great for keeping my daughter's hands busy instead of touching other things. While it does slide around on some larger toilets, I'd say it fits well to about 75% of toilets we've used it on.
this is a good toilet ring, but ONLY if you have the smallest, round toilet seats.  the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit, but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps.  my home has a mix of elongated/round seats, and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls.  we use that for our elongated seats, and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway.  otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train.
I bought this seat because I (bad mommy) forgot my 2 year old daughter's potty in a hotel while we were on vacation. She absolutely loves this potty seat! She loves that she can take it off and put it on another toilet if need be. She uses her little step stool to get up on the big potty and she feels like a big girl. The fact that is Dora is a huge bonus for her. She uses this every day.
Really, how hard can it be to design one of these things? This fails for two basic reasons:1) It slides backwards on the toilet seat making it unstable and hard for my daughters to sit down. This is an enormous design flaw.2) The pee guard is basically flush with the seat, so what is its purpose other than to decrease the actual potty-business real estate? It takes away room for daughters' pee to go down. And it's not high enough to save my baby boy from getting soaked when my daughter didn't clamp her knees shut tightly enough to prevent her pee from shooting cleanly over the guard and onto baby's head. He was not pleased. Neither was I.I also have a two mini-potties, the Fisher Price froggy and singing ducky. The pee guard on the froggy potty is great. I love this low-tech seat as it's easy to clean and hands down my twin daughters' favorite. The singing duck potty was more expensive, is much harder to clean, is annoyingly loud and wakes up the baby, and there are a lot more spills due to the lack of pee guard. Highly recommend the froggy potty if you are in the market.
I have a boy, so the little guard cup was useful until my son learned to pull it out. After sitting on the toilets for chunks of time (waiting :) he got bored so he would pull this out &#8212;not very helpful! I wish it was permanently attached to the seat. Other than that it's fantastic, soft, stable, easy to sit on and clean.
We had a seat SORT OF like this when my son was training - and lost it.  Not sure if it was the same manufacturer or not.  It had no handles then, and the pee guard stood up high and was removable.  We never used the pee guard, it made it harder to get on the seat and it just wasn't needed - we just taught my son to point it down.Now I am training twin girls and thinking Elmo might get one of them on the potty more (one shows way more interest than the other - it's the reluctant one I want to bribe)  We have little potties with inserts that come off but most parents know the power of Elmo - I'm willing to try anything at this point, within reason.  (ie the all-out free standing elmo potty is too much, LOL, and I want to take advantage of the fact that both are willing to use the big potty with an insert)The reviews about the pee guard on this were so puzzling I had to see it in person before buying it - and it looks TERRIBLE.  It's a very low pee guard.  Basically too low to serve any purpose for a boy, but it's there, and it's high enough that boy or girl I can see them peeing on it and making more of a mess than if it wasn't there.  (One of my girls likes to look down and kind of shift her stuff forward as she pees - not normally a problem, but with this in the way, it would be)  And it does not come off.  I actually stood there in the store contemplating if we could cut it out somehow, maybe with a dremmel, but you shouldn't have to make modifications to a potty ring.  It's one of the worst designs I can imagine.  It's like I can kind of see what they were thinking but they should have thought harder.  So I decided to skip this.  Even if we were to have marginal success with it, I am pregnant with another boy now, and I refuse to buy something I know he won't be able to use.I am really kicking myself for not replacing my son's potty ring when we lost it, but he was doing well enough without it and I never saw it becoming a hard to find item.  No handles made it easier to travel with.  We kept it in our diaper bag.  Now I am in the market for a used potty ring!
Purchased this for my Grandson to use at my house. Works very well and he really liked the Spiderman all over the potty. He used it and all is working well - I also bought the step stool (Thomas the Train logo on step stool).
My daughter is having some hard time with potty training, especially number 2. The doctor recommended that she sits twice a day for ten minutes in a row in the potty, and we decided to buy this toilet seat.Well, two weeks using it and we are finally making progress!! She LOVES her Dora, super pink, flowery potty, so sitting on it is a delight. We were using the potty before, but I thought if we were going to train her for good, it was better to train her in the toilet. And it is very difficult without a toilet seat, because she is not stable.The handles are great, toddlers use them all the time. And the size is just right. Very sturdy and easy to clean (you can separate the cushion from the plastic, to clean separately). My toilet is not exactly the same shape (the potty seat is somewhat rounder), but it is sturdy enough so it is not a problem.We love it and I highly recommend it. There are other designs for boys as well, but the pink Dora one is great for girls this age.
My nearly 2 year old son wants to use the potty, but has trouble with the splash guard/cup on this model.  He loves Elmo and wants to carry this seat around but will not use it.  We also bought the Primo Ducka.  He will sit on that seat all day if you let him.  This might be a good choice for parents of girls.
This is colorful, soft, and makes lots of fun sounds babies love.  I would recommend it to anyone for their baby.
This little worm has been great for my little one. She loves that that head and tail rattle while she can squeeze the red and blue to get crinkle noises. The squeakers are two different pitches which is also fun. I just washed mine for the first time and aired it dry. Still works great. We are very happy with our purchase
We received this product and our little one really likes all the colors and the squeaking noise but I'm not sure where the &#34;crinkle&#34; part comes from because our product must be defective.  There isn't any crinkle but we can live without.
We purchased this gate almost 2 years ago when my daughter started crawling.  She's now 2 1/2 years old.  I've been meaning to write a review on this gate since it is one of the best gates for the stairs.  We have mounted it at the top of the stair.  My husband used small pieces of 2x4's for extra security to mount it on the side of the stairs that has plaster (as opposed to a wooden post).  This gate is very strong and is holding up very well (minus the fingerprints :).  A few times, I have caught my daughter standing at it shaking it or trying to stand on it, which I make her stop. Fortunately, there are no vertical bars, just horizontal, so climbing it would be a little difficult.  I'd done quite a bit of research on baby gates before purchasing this one at Babies R Us, but in trying to save a few dollars, I first went to Wal-Mart and bought a metal top-of-the-stairs gate, but I decided to take it back since it had a raised "platform" (for lack of a better word) piece at the bottom.  I think that platform was meant for extra sturdiness, but I saw it as an accident waiting to happen.  I returned that gate before we even installed it.  This gate doesn't have that "platform" and it is still very sturdy.  Another nice feature about this is that you can just slip the gate out of its brackets to remove it if you are having a party or have to run up and down the stairs without needing to swing the gate out of your way.  And when you are ready to put it back, just line the gate up with the brackets and slide it in place.  Really nice feature for us when we were moving our daughter's furniture from one room to the other and downstairs, we didn't have the gate in our way since we removed the swing arm.  Overall, we are very pleased and would buy this gate again if we had to.
My 18 month old cannot break this no matter how hard she tries. And she has broken pretty much everything else that she can get her hands on. It was very easy to install.  I drilled mine to the door posts because I didn't want to take any chances with my little one. My 7 year old niece couldn't figure out how to open this gate, much less the baby. Peace of mind without breaking the bank is what this provides you.
We have two of these gates and we couldn't be more pleased with them.  They took a little time to install (it was a snap the second time around), and they are as sturdy and secure as you can get.  We don't feel the slightest twinge of concern when our 1 year old leans against this gate at the top of the steps.  We know it's not going anywhere.  The gate is so simple to open and close.  A small child would not be able to do it on his or her own though.  The gate's design ensures that little climbers will not be able to get a lift.  We've tried lots of gates and this one is our favorite.
I actually love having this gate at the BOTTOM of our stairs!  My 15 month old daughter rarely climbs the stairs now, but we often have other children over that do.  With hard tile at the bottom of the stairs, a tumble would be bad.  I wanted a gate at the bottom of the stairs, but not an eyesore that was in the way all the time when not in use.We tried the soft and wide gate and another pressure-mounted gate, but those are a pain...  it takes a lot of time to get them in place securely (kids are rough and can knock or pull them down easily) and then if you want to go up the stairs once you have it in place, you have to climb over it all the time!  Not practical...What I love about this gate is that it slides right off of the hinges and stores away in the closet when not in use!  The wall-mounted parts are very small and hardly noticeable when the gate is stored away.  Then, when I need the gate, it takes less than a minute to get it out and slide it back into place.This gate is a life-saver for play group days!  I highly recommend this gate.
We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates. Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates. Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom. This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't.)
We currently live in housing on base in Germany and the stairs are very wide and unusual. I got this gate since it is made for the top of the stairs and was wide enough for our staircase. It works great! I love that it slides to the side as well as opens. Was a breeze to install and I feel really safe with the fact that it is a really great hardware mount. No complaints here my son is 10 months and pulls up on everything so it is nice to know he is safe! The one hand open is really simple and I like it more than any gate I have seen at friends houses.
I bought this set for my almost 3-year old son.  He likes them okay, I'm thinking we'll get more play out of them later.  The mat is pretty small, but cute (it's just a plastic sheet), and the assortment of dinosaurs is adequate.  I like having a storage container for the set so I don't step on dinosaurs!
Round about December 22nd, my three year old daughter started telling everyone she was asking Santa for a dinosaur for Christmas.  This was a surprise because A- she's the most feminine child ever, and B- I had long since finished my Christmas shopping and wasn't planning on buying another thing.  However, I didn't want her to lose faith in Santa and ended up searching Amazon to see what I could come up with.  This toy got my attention because it was a whole host of dinosaurs with a mat for them to &#34;play&#34; on.  My daughter loved it!  For weeks she would get it out on a daily basis to arrange the dinosaurs on their &#34;terrain.&#34;  From a girl's perspective, it's really cute in that there are small versions of the big dinosaurs included, so kids can group &#34;mommy&#34; dinosaurs with &#34;baby&#34; dinosaurs.  She doesn't get it out quite as often now that it's been a few months, but when she does she's every bit as delighted.  And the dinosaurs are such high quality, I know my ten month old son will be enjoying it in no time.
Purchased for our 2 year old grandson and he loves the dinosaurs. He doesn't have much use for the plastic play mat or the rocks, but plays a lot with the dinos and trees!
2 stars for bad marketing & items missing. We received as a gift, so our annoyance is probably moderated. This review is for product misrepresentation.-- Only received 1 out of 2 volcanoes.-- Image provided with the expressive boy in red shirt is completely misleading. There is no "play mat," but rather a thin piece of rectangular plastic that is more like an over-size disposable place-mat. Only large enough for half the pieces. The scene is completely different from that image. The real image has none of the detail.-- "Rocks" are completely useless three-sided thin pieces of grey sides, thus no bottoms and sometimes missing a side altogether. Only received 10 out of 12, but not really missing them.Half the dinosaurs are very small (1-2 inches) and the other half are more medium range (3-6 inches). Some people commented of the usefulness of the names printed on the undersides, but we have encountered 2 other brands that provide the same labeling, so that appears to be a given with a variety pack.The use of the big names "Animal Planet" and "Toy R Us" should be a tip-off. Over-priced small dinosaurs, 6 trees, and a small plastic bin.
Comes with 20 dinosaurs, 12 small rocks, a large volcano, a medium sized volcano, 6 trees, and a play mat. This set is great. I would prefer more dinosaurs and less rocks, but oh well. It is still great. My three and a half year old loves playing with this set. The play mat is actually pretty cheap, but my son doesn't seem to care. It is made of really thin plastic and doesn't stay open all the way since it has been folded. Once you put all the dinosaurs on it, though, it stays down just fine. All the rest of the stuff is high quality and the tub is great for keeping everything together. Just for size reference, the brachiosaurus is 6 1/2 inches tall, and this is the biggest dinosaur in the set. I'm really happy with the size of all the dinosaurs. I was worried that they were going to be kind of small, but they are a perfect size.
My daughter is now 7 months old and loves this. She started going in it about 3-4 months.  She is all over the house, and pushing the buttons. I would reccomend this to everyone with young children.  This is a lifesaver for me, I put her in it when I hop in the shower in the mornings and she stays in the bathroom rolling around in it, or just sitting there playing with all the buttons.. I love this walker!!!!
My son has used this walker sense he was 4 months old. We love it. Yes it is a little loud, but we taped some of thoughse cotton wipes from the hospital over the speaker and now it is perfect.
as soon as my son was able to sit up this was his favorite thing to be in. he could spend HOURS in this. i could give him snacks by removing the activity piece and he could run around the entire house snacking.there are rubber stoppers on the bottom of this so that if you have stairs they cant go down them even if they tried. this was great for when he was outside with it. we have a concrete steps walkway and he couldnt go down it and hurt himself, something i was not expecting but very useful! my son learned to walk @ 1 so this did not delay him developely. also when he used this in the house he couldnt get into a lot of trouble with it(like touching outlets, opening cupboards) because he couldn't reach. this never frustrated him and i could get a lot done because i didnt have to watch him like a hawk.my son played with this till he was a little over 2 so we got a TON of miles out of it. he still found it fun at such an older age because he would get a running start in it, then lift his legs for fast back and fourth travel around the house. GREAT GREAT BUY! i dont know what i wouldve done without it!
I did my research on a walker and decided on this one thankfully. The wheels move great. Very loose. If you get one and the wheels are tight, call Graco and have them replace it. It rolls well on carpet tile and pavement.I love the fact that it has the removeable noise making device with an ON/OFF switch. It takes 3 "AA" batteries. It can get dirty on the tray under the noise device too.My 4 mo. old son loves it. I love it. When I go to the gym, I throw it in the back of the truck. Then just take it out of the truck, put the boy in, and roll him right into the gym. He lets me run on the treadmill for an hour when he's in it. Very handy.
Completely amazing play pen. Eazy to pack up and great for playing! We love the toys on the sides and the cool colors. It is a great size too.The only improvement I could even imagine would be more padding on the pad.
How FUN and AWESOME!!! Got this for my grandson and still can't get over how bright and playful this is. Even I want to get in it and play! The built in activities on the side are the best. The squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby...but the other toys are super! It was so so so simple to put up!!! Love the bigger size, while not being overwhelming...those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most...
I bought it for my 4 month old son and he loves it. I had doubts regarding the big size but it has turned out the best of this because I feel I have him free but secure at the same time. Colors and decoration are fun and keeps my baby busy and happy.
I bought this playpen to use at my house when I babysit the grandkids. My 10 mo old grandson seems to like to play in it. It will keep him entertained for about 30 mins, which is enough to get dinner started or take care of his older brother. It's really colorful and large and I like the toys on the netting. He sleeps well in it too. Just a great playpen.
I did some research before buying this playard and I am very happy i did.  It is the most colorful out there, easy to assemble and travel with. My baby is very particular, but she loves this playard.  It may to be obvious at first, but each of the walls has a bug with some functions.  for instance, the butterfly has wings that have foil inside to make squishing sound when you touch the,m.  The other bug, when squeezed, makes a sound, the third one, has rattles in its wings, and finally, the sun is a mirror (not a great one though). Given its price and the fact that it is being discontinued, I highly recommend getting one before they are off the market.
I give this a 5 start plus.My 6 month old Grandbaby  was put in this playpen yesterday for his first time.  It was obvious he really liked it by the big smiles and how his mind was preoccupied with the play items on the sides and bottom. It was a difficult first baby shots day and he was hurting on both legs. The graphics and sides toys kept him more focused on fun & he was able to get some temporary relief.  I know as he feels better he is going to enjoy his new & safe play space even more.Thank you Amazon for this colorful playpen choice at the lowest price and your excellent service. I'll positively be back.
I have a standard Graco pack and play that does not have much room. I bought this pack in play several months ago because of the bright colors. I love how much room it has compared to the standard size pack and plays.Like the other pack and plays this is easy to fold up and store against the wall. I hav to do so every night since I live in a smaller house and have a cat that might like to jump in it while we are sleeping and make it his new nap spot.The colors are vibrant and have kept my now 13 month old interested and intrigued. She loves to play with the butterfly wings and hit the squeaky toy. It is a generous size without taking up too much room on the floor. I like that there is more space for kids and their toys. She has fallen asleep in it many times.Not recommended but I have sat in it with her and it is very sturdy, It is very level.  I have had this for about 9 months now and it still looks like new. I think for the size it is highly recommended. I trust the Graco name too.
I love this pack n' play.  I bought my son the pack n' play in rise n' shine with a bassinet.  What a waste.  This is the best pack n' play.  My mom bought one for her house and after I saw how much my son liked it I immediately went out and bought one for myself.  He loves the stuff on the sides and stares at the bright colors.  Also, it is a lot bigger than most of the other pack n' plays and will come in really handy for holding toys when my son gets a little older.  I definitely recommend this.
I ordered this for our 4 month old son and when it arrived I opened it up myself and didnt read the directions at first I got frustrated since I couldnt get it together then read them and voila it took me and a freind about 3 minutes to set it up! Our son is past the stage where he will stay put in a floor bouncy chair so he loves the freedom of lying in this stretching out,and kicking. We loved it so much we ordered one for my mother in law so she can have in her house when he comes to visit. He also takes naps in it, we are hoping to travel with a smaller version of this pack and play soon...will let you know how that works out.
I researched what I wanted in the way of a fun playpen for when my grandchildren visit. This is the one I chose, easy up and easy down and easy to put away, plus being fun for them is an added bonus. Thanks!
let me state at the onset that this pack n play was a little above my price range.  I was hoping to pay for something around $75 at the most.  I had a pack n play from graco with the changing table attached.  I basically have it solely for that purpose - the changing table. With the holidays coming and some overnight stays expected, I wanted one that was easy to put together and fold up and go QUICKLY.  I read numerous reviews on Amazon on several pack n plays.  I kept coming back to this one mostly b/c of the bright colors. I was basically sold when I read one review that stated a 14 year old put this together in less than a minute.  NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!  I'm a single mom and have absolutely no patience for something that is complicated.  My mom and I put the graco pack n play with the changing table together and it was very difficult. I think it took over an hour to put together with another person.  The review I read was dead on.  I took the totbloc pack n play out of the box and had it together within 2 minutes.  My 9 month old baby loves it.  it is VERY ROOMY inside.  She has not slept in it yet since I only got it today.  The bottom is fairly quilted and I don't think she will have a problem with napping in it.  She loves the bugs on the 4 sides too.  The bright colors are great.  I'm sure we will be using this for a long time.
Perfect, i love the fact it is bigger then the pack and plays but folds up just like a pack and play. Awesome toys!!!
Still using this... its big and he doesn't mind going in it for me to shower. We also have used it to help him calm down, if he throws a fit we just sit him in with a toy and tell him when he is ready we will get out. Works well, just walk away and he calms down without an audience. Then we get back out, also when I tell him I want him to go in so I can take a shower he goes to it and waits to be put in. So he definately doesn't mind. He likes the toys in it too, wheres the baby (the mirror) was a favorite.
We have used it only once to travel, it was easy to asemble, the parts seem to be of really good quality, the colors and decoration are nice. Our baby slept and played in it during our 3 day trip, I was able to move it around the house were we stayed with no problem. The mat seems to be a little thin but a couple of blankets wrapped around it made it seem much more comfortable to sleep in it. Because is larger than the average our baby was very comfortable and had plenty of room to move around, the downside is that it makes it a little heavy, not a big deal unless you're planning to hike mount Everest with it. Fits well in any SUV trunk leaving plenty of space for luggage. Disassembling it was a breeze and packing it was pretty straight forward. I'll recommend this product.
When I was first looking for Playards I was becoming pretty dissapointed because all of them made it clear you could only use it with 1 baby. I was asking my Sister in law about it and she said both her kids still play in theirs and they were 2 & 5 years at the time. She said they are really rough in it at the same time and nothing is wrong with it at all. I think they just put the guidelines to be OVER safe.Anyhow, this was the biggest one and had so many good reviews I decided to get it. I actually bought mine used and it was like new. I took Clorox Spray anywhere and cleaned the mat, the bugs & the top rails. It wiped right off & the fabric wasn't even wet, it is sort of water resistant.I started putting both my twins in here before they could sit up on their own. I also always put extra toys in there for them which they love. I used to keep this set up in our living room but now we keep it in our van to use when we visit people. It is so easy to set up and tear down and my girls love playing in it. I think we'll be able to use this for a long time. Both my girls are 11 months old right now and can pull themselves up just enough to chew on the top rails.So if you're looking for something to use with twins, definately buy this. It is perfectly safe to use. I would not recomment the "twin" playard. It has the double on top but your babies will outgrow it pretty fast and then you're stuck with a pretty small playard for twins.
I think this playpen is great; it's spacious, sturdy, and colorful. My 10 month old thinks it's a prison. She will tolerate it for about 10-15 minutes at a time, which is fine because it buys me some time where I don't have to worry about her safety. I first introduced her to the playpen when she was about 7 months old. I think she found all of the characters at the bottom to be frightening, but she was fine after I put the sheet on. I'd hoped she'd grow to spend more time in the playpen, but tolerates it less and less as she becomes more mobile.
It gives my 2 girls (1 & 2 years old) enough room to play when I need to keep them somewhere safe while I shower or cook. I use their other Graco Pack and Play as storage for their toys since it seems a little too small for 2 kids.Although the bright colors are fun for kids, I'd like to see more neutral versions of this so it doesn't stick out so much in my living room.
My husband and I like to just try to figure things out and read instructions only after we are dumbfounded. It was kind of funny for about 90 seconds, then we had to read the instructions, which, it turns out, work. The only tricky part is the release button being hidden inside the four top bars under the fabric. I kept trying to squeeze it but there is a button on the underside that has to be pushed up into the handle. This pack n' play feels plenty sturdy to me. It's nice that it has a carrying case with strap. We used this as a place to stash twin babies at home when they were too small for bouncy chairs and swings and such. They got their tummy time and social time in it, although the pad is a bit slick for them to try to push with their feet to turn over, so a towel helps. We also use it as a pack n' play when traveling for them to sleep in. I wish it was just a bit smaller when folded, as I thought it would fit on the floor of the passenger seat, but it has to go in the trunk.
I have been looking for the play yard that I had for my children. The other pack and plays are too small. I don't understand why they don't sell these in stores all the time. I live in Hawaii and have been trying to buy one of these for three years. No one would ship to Hawaii. When, I saw it on Amazon. I was amazed and decided to try to order it. I was really shocked as I was going through checkout. And, amazingly they were letting me order it. The shipping was really cheap. And, I ordered it on Sunday and received it on Wednesday. How, wonderful. My grandson was put in there immediately to see his reaction. He is only 6 months old and loved it. Thank You Amazon for having this wonderful product. And, of course shipping it to me. I am going to order one more. Just totally LOVE it.
I like this pack n play. The only problem I have is that the middle kind of sinks in so unless your baby is a highly experienced sitter, it is tough for them to balance b/c it's slanted in towards the center. But the colors are pleasing and I didn't know this but the animals/sun embroidered on all 4 sides have little attachements that the baby can play with when their in the pack n play. That was a nice little surprise. My daugter loves the little wings on the bee b/c they have little rattles in them and they make noise when she hits them.
My baby loves to stay inside to play with bee and lady bug when she was small like 6 months old.Now she is 17 months old, sometimes I need to get things done so I put her in and give her some toys she still can play by herself, of course she sometimes complaints by yelling since she wants my attention, but I love this piece it helps me to get things done while she is in my sight, since I can fit this pc in my kitchen
Although this isn't the lightest thing to carry, it is very serviceable! Ever since I purchased this play pen for my grandson, it has been used every weekday. It goes up about 8 a.m. and down about 4:30 p.m. It still looks as new as the first time we used it. I like the netting one the sides and the padding on the floor and rail. Also, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to set it up or take it down. And, it is bigger than the beds that turn into play pens in the Graco line.
As soon as I opened the box, I could tell by the VOC's that this playard was treated with chemicals.  I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants.  In addition, some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl...like the entire face of the sun is PVC.  Why would you let your child play, let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew.  I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard.  It's the same size but quite a bit more expensive. The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants.  Definitely worth it to pay the extra $, knowing my children won't be exposed to harmful chemicals.
I bought this last summer for my two year old when traveling. He had outgrown his regular pack and play. I was looking for something larger but still had the sides. I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I love this bed. It does take up some room but it was amazing when we were traveling. I did put down dome padding because the mat isn't that comfortable however I would definitely recommend.
I have three kids. The first two didn't need a playpen, but my 8 month old baby is the most adventurous yet. Everything goes into his mouth - dust bunnies, little scraps of paper my other two kids overlooked when they cleaned up after playing with paper, anything. I'm worried he will eventually find a little toy like a Squinkie, or something will fall off of a counter, and he will get it. He also pulls the kitchen chairs over on him, so we have them bungie corded to the table legs. Of course we will still give him supervised time to roam, but we needed him to have a safe place to go other than his excersaucer. Now that he crawls and cruises he is not content in his excersaucer for more than a couple of minutes. He would much rather play UNDER the excersaucer. We let him check out the playpen from the outside before we put him inside so he would be intrigued. So far he likes it. He is able to cruise in the playpen and gum the top rail. I purchased some new toys to put in it too so he will have something new to play with in there.Each of the sides has a toy on the mesh. I've checked out two of the sides. One crinkles when it is touched and another is a mirror. They seem to each have elements that are popular in baby toys.I also got another of the same playpen for my parents house. They have a dog that chews his toys (and the baby's) to bits. And their floor is not clean enough for a baby to crawl on.The playpen sets up and folds down just like the smaller Pack and Plays. It is essentially the same thing. It is a square as wide as the longest side of the Pack and Play.
The playpen is large and spacious,perfect for babies to roll around and play in. My only gripe is if the baby were to puke on the mat there's no way to wash the entire thing, just spot clean.  To solve this problem one has to buy a covering/sheet to cover the playpen surface.  Sheets are hard to find, and expensive to purchase and ship. But on a positive note the playpen is sturdy and easy to assemble.
it is a wonderful play pen. bright, safe, sturdy and soft at the same time. my son loves touching/looking at the pictures and shapes of the sun with mirror, butterfly with wings that make sounds when you touch them, the ladybug with rattle wings and a squicky ladybug. my son loves playing there and enjoys looking at the images even if he is out of the play pen. thank you, it is a great item!
I fancy myself a &#34;stylish&#34; mom; expensive nursery set, shopping at Restoration Hardware and Pottery Barn Baby. We got the black and grey pack 'n' play that goes well with our home decor, then my parents picked up this pack 'n' play for their home. Our daughter hated the pack 'n' play we had and loved theirs so we ended up getting one too. She loves the colors, and playing with the items on the sides. I love it because it is a square and much larger than the plain one we had. We HIGHLY recommend.
I can't express how much I love this play yard. My son has been using and playing in this since he was 5 months old and he is 15 months old now. The bright colors, designs, and toys caught his attention right away. When I put him in other play yards we have, he won't stay in it long and wants to come out right away, but when we put him in this play yard he is completely distracted and has fun playing in it with his other toys. There is a lot of space for him to move around and it is very sturdy. I also love how easy it is to set up and take down plus the carry bag makes it easier to bring when traveling back and forth to his grandma's house. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
I love this product in all respects, except for the four paneled padded flooring.The design of it tends to not lay flat, once you put a sheet or a cover on it.This is a real flaw in the design.  AND, it is super important that you follow thedirections for putting this up, and be sure to use the velcro straps to securethe flooring pad in place.  Just get the help of another person to secure thevelcro straps, and you will be all set.  Otherwise, I do like the sturdiness of theside rails, and the bright primary colors.  Not the best for napping, as thebaby will continuously play with the built in side toys.  Some of the toysrattle and crinkle, and once baby finds the party, they will not want to laydown to nap.  But I still love this playyard so much, I bought two of them!
I read all the reviews on the pack and plays and found that the reviews on this one were all great. I do not have a child but I watch my nephew very frequently (every other weekend). I wanted something that could be both a place to sleep and a place to play. With its bright colors and toys built in my nephews face turned to smiles. He is so comfortable that when he is done playing and tired he will put his head down to sleep. He loves the rattle butterfly and the crinkle butterfly. He plays with the toys on the pack n play more then the toys in the pack in play. Set up was a breeze. Before buying this pack n play we borrowed my brothers. What a pain to put together and take apart. Sometimes all the sides did not lock and you had to start all over. And take down, you prayed before you start that all the pieces snap apart and it will take you less then 20 minutes. With this pack n play it takes a minute, parts snap and unsnap quickly it is the true pack n play. The bag is a little cheaply made then other bags I've seen but fits perfectly. The padding on the bottom of the pack n play is thicker then others I have seen. It is larger then other pack n plays so you will have a hard time finding bedding and sheets that fit it properly.
I love this one..... it's bright ,comfortable, adorable ,easy to use. love the size and i use it all the time...my baby boy loves it too.Anyway I'm going to purchase it again for my newborn niece
If you're like me you may have gone back and forth between this Graco and the Delta (Novel) playard. I ended up buying them both for my twins and here is the comparison.Ease of setup--they both take about a minute to put up. The graco was slightly easier to push the middle down that pops it all I to place.Weight & sturdiness--the graco feels lighter than the Delta (a good 5 lbs+), but the Delta feels a bit sturdier when set up, and seems slightly more durable.Shape--the graco is very squared off, and the Delta is square on bottom but curves inward as it goes up so the top railings are in a more round shape. This feels like its saving some space even though the dimensions are the same.Mattress--the graco has a very bright, colorful mattress pad with squares and bugs on it. It has a decent thickness in terms of padding for the baby to be comfortable. The pad also lays flat, but you do get a slight dip in the middle after a baby has been in there for a while. The Delta has a colorful mattress pad but with 'gentler' tones of color featuring the animals on the mesh sides. The padding is not as thick feeling as the graco, but the pad itself is more water and stain proof of a material than the graco. Even though it's not as padded feeling it feels sturdier. No dip in the middle, and I would feel a bit more comfortable with more weight in the Delta.Mesh---they both seem to have equally durable mesh. The graco has built in toys on each side of the mesh; whereas the Delta has the animals printed on the mesh.Price--the graco is more expensive than the Delta.All in all they are both nice. I think the better one depends on what you are planning on using it for. If it's going to be up all the time at your house or daycare, etc. I think the Delta is built sturdier and will be more durable with continued daily use. If you are using it to bring around with you places (hotel, camping, on the back deck, grandma's, etc). then I would go for the Graco because it is much lighter to lug around, and has built in toys so if you forget to bring some there is still toys for baby to play with. The graco also seems sturdy and durable; the Delta just seems a bit better in those departments; that's all.The 3ft by 3ft size is amazing!!  Wish I had bought one sooner!  We have twins and they both can play in one together without them feeling like they are on top of each other.
My son comes to work with me and I keep him in here when he's active - sleepy. I've had it now for almost a year. What a great buy.
Highly recommend this to all parents with Infant and Toddlers. This is such a great playpen to have in your home as an alternative to the crib. My son loves to play in it and also sleep in his playpen which we put in the living room. We bought this together with some fitted pack n play (Graco Square Play Yard) from SheetWorld on Amazon (if anyone is interested) and the sheets totally fit the square pad that comes with the playpen. We also made an extra padding cushion so it would be comfortable for our son to sleep in. You can also fold this up nicely and make it compacted for traveling if need to. This is a great purchase! :) You will not dissapoint.
Once my little one started crawling and the little snugabunny gym was no longer safe, my husband reminded me we got this at our baby shower. Baby likes the colors and all the noises, he has plenty of room to move around and he is safe in it. I love that it's made well and expect to use it for a while.
I love the size and sturdiness of it! Gives kids more play room than the average playpen. It also holds up well to our large baby playing wildly in it. She loves the various objects on the sides and the different noises and such they have to offer. We haven't traveled with it so can't comment on the transportability. The pad that comes with is not waterproof and even with a thick quilted cover under the sheet tinkle still leaks through to the pad so I suggest getting a plastic cover for under the sheet. Overall a great buy!
I bought this for my granddaughter and another one for second child  well made hours of fun easy to use and love primary colors and designs on it  entertaining
This playyard is amazing! It's such a good deal for the money. It makes the other playyards look like a joke! Most other playyards are dark and the mesh is dark so your baby can't see out and therefore wants to get out asap. This playyard is really bright and gorgeous, and the mesh is clear so baby can see out. It looks inviting and fun to be in there! Also, other playyards are uncomfortable- no wonder your baby screams to get out- the floors aren't thick enough and the support bars can be felt through the floor. This playyard has a really thick, high-quality floor that is comfortable and baby could sleep on. Also, this playyard is really big- huge!- which makes it way nicer for baby. I am so glad I found this playyard online!
LOVE this pack n play. nice bright colors, great roomy size for bubs and an absolute breeze to set up and take down. takes literally 30 seconds! great value for money too. we were intitally given a second-hand one (used at our home business) and loved it so much we bought a second one for home.reason for only 4 stars - i just wish the floor had a little more padding. but after researching, this is the best play yard i could find.
I have had this pack n' play for a few weeks now and my son seems to enjoy it.  We use it for quick corralling, not prolonged play time.  He likes the toys on the sides, and I like that it is larger than most of the play yards I've seen, granting that my experience is limited.-It goes up and down VERY easily and quickly.-It is not very heavy for the size and sturdiness.  My parents have a Cosco playyard that they borrowed from a friend for when we visit.  Theirs is about half the size and seems almost as heavy.-The square shape on the TotBloc is nice, too because he can move around a bit in there and actually get somewhere instead of just rolling over once and hitting the end.-There is no listed weight limit on this, only a height limit.  That was a major deciding factor for my big boy!Overall I think it's a great product for the price.
I bought this play yard to put my 8 month old in when I need to keep her contained and safe while I am cooking. It is perfect. The size is ideal as she is able to roll and move around it and play with her toys but does not take up all of the room in our small living area. The pad seems comfy and she will be able to nap in it. The toys on the sides are great, she loves to play with the butterfly. I am very happy with this product.
OMG....this play pen is a life saver. My son crawls around like crazy. When I'm in the kitchen cleaning up or fixing dinner I can't always be watching him so this is perfect. He hangs out and plays or stands up and (tries) to talk to me. I don't keep him in here for a long period of time because I feel that he needs to be a kid and crawl around too.  It's easy to pack up too. I took it to the park with me. I shoved it in the bottom of our UppaBaby Vista stroller. #NYCMom**KEY NOTE*** the middle part has to be up for the sides to bend down.
Very big and roomy. Folds and sets up with ease. My only complaint is that although you can remove the bottom pad, the cover on it is not removeable or water proof, so there is no way to wash it and feel like it's "clean". There are sheets for this square play yard to purchase separately, but they aren't all that cheap and sheets themselves are not waterproof. So if your baby soils through his diaper onto the mattress, or your toddler has a barf-fest, good luck trying to get that smell out. You can "spot clean" with a warm rag, but lets face it. Poop and puke requires the washer. And you're not able to do that with this pad.
We bought it last week and it was so easy to set up - I only looked at the help on the back of the mat once when I could not figure out why the fourth rail would not lock - turned out they do not lock if the floor is all the way back. Pulling the center up just an inch allowed to lock it and the babe went in. He instantly loved it - he can see everyone through the mesh, he loves playing with wings of two butterflies (rattle and crinkle) and  tries to pick the smiley faces from the mat or kiss them. At 7,5 months old, he enjoys up to an hour  in it playing there on his own (he is not really crawling yet but learned to sit up on his own and can roll around it to reach toys and wings on the side panels. I read some reviews that the floor is not too even, but I did not notice it with mine.
I bought this for my nine month granddaughter when she comes to visit.  She loves it!  It's practical, sturdy and so easy to set up and take down.  The colors are bright and cheerful and the attached &#34;toys&#34; are so cute&#34;.
I totally recommend this especially for big babies as well.  We took this  whenever we go on a trip and my son just loved staying here. Its mesh walls give nice breeze while my little one was sleeping. Totally recommend it!!!
Very cute and bright gender neutral play yard. Easy to put up and take down. Nice and roomy, she doesn't mind going in to play. Very sturdy. Will be handing down to my sister for her new baby. It is very durable and well made to last. Which is nice when something lasts and you can use for more then one baby.
extra space, entertaining and fun! little over priced but it's safe and durable so we enjoyed it while it was needed.
I love this pack n play!  The other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us (and they were twice the price).... It was the one with a changing table and bassinet.  I finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger, boxier and roomier. My son hates restraints and being boxed in, but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play, and is willing to stay in it for 20-30 minutes at a time (a record!).  And he is 2.5 now, so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere....
This is a nice, large playpen with bright colors and activity items on the sides to entertain baby. The corners are perfect for a baby to learn to pull up to stand, and the sides are tall enough to keep the child safe inside.  (Apparently, the sides are also fun for teething babies to chew on, but what isn't?)  I have no tested the portability of the playpen since we use it daily in our living room when baby has quiet playtime before bed.
When my daughter started rolling, it was time for a little containment -- but Grandma bemoaned the fact that none of the standard play yards had as much space as the playpens of my childhood. (You remember, the massive wooden ones Moms would schlep from house to beach to park?) So looking for roomy containment plus the convenience of a portable play yard, there was only one viable candidate: the Graco PackNPlay Bugs. There's room enough for my 7-month-old and a hundred toys, it folds easily into its shoulder bag, cleans up in a snap and the price is great. Best of all, and unlike most play yards, it's FUN; my girl could spend an hour just batting at the colorful bugs on the walls (all make sounds) and floor or giggling at herself in the built-in mirror. And as a play space, it's a happy medium between a tiny play yard and a huge Superyard.
We have this one and love it. My son typically doesn't like a pack and play or even to be in the crib too long. But, it is great for those days when they are small and you want to be outside at an outing and don't want to have to sit and hold your child all day. When my son was a little baby, we pulled out the mat and hooked up the toy dangler and he was amazed for hours. My son is now 14 months old and we recently took a 3 day vacation and took it along. We set it up in the hotel room and it worked perfectly. It also saved us the money of having to rent a crib at the hotel. He likes all the animals on the sides. Not to mention, what a dream to put up and take down. We have an older model pack and play and it is very hard to get the sides up and down. This one is so easy! Highly recommend.
This is a great product for both Non-breastfed and breastfed (suggest use after about a month so baby is used to nursing and milk supply is established) babies. This unique system works best for eliminating excessive air from the bottle therefore preventing excessive gas! The nipples are a little larger than some babies may prefer but are closer to the breast than most other bottles. Without a doubt my favorite bottle for our son and we will be sure to use it with our next child!
These are one of only a few brands of bottles out there that has a variety of nipples so if your baby doesn't like one nipple, you can try the others.  Most other bottles only offer one nipple and if your baby doesn't like it, you have to buy a completely different set of bottles.These bottles are also interchangeable with the Playtex Premium bottles, so you can have a variety of colors and designs.Get an extra box of liners for each size.These are easy to clean, just toss the liner and wash the bottle in warm, soapy water.  Not scrubbing with a bottle brush to get the lump of formula out of the bottom.  :c)
Ok, my 3 yr. old shouldn't be drinking out of a bottle anymore BUT, I have really put these bottles to good use! I have a 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 yr. old still drinking out of these....they have a few quirks but you deal with them and get used to it and LOVE, LOVE , LOVE the ease of use! I do,however, wash the liners sometimes to re-use or I'd be in bankruptcy...Publix and Walmart and other stores have liners you can use when the Playtex gets to be too expensive!
The drop in system is all we use for our daughter and I just love it. I will keep on using it and recommending it highly. So far we have not used the 8-oz bottles but maybe in the future. These nipples are far superior in my opinion because they're such a natural shape.
I like these smartly-designed bottles a lot.  They have reduced my son's colic and gas discomforts dramatically by reducing the amount of air he takes in while feeding.  My son is primarily breastfed, but my wife and I supplement his breastfeedings with pumped breastmilk and with formula.  The Original Nursers are made from polypropylene, which is a BPA-free plastic.  The liners are also BPA-free although I'm not sure what kind of plastic they are manufactured from.  Unlike some other corporations in the baby products industry, Playtex Baby is serious about customer support.  I have called the customer service number several times now and have gotten to talk to a knowledgeable person in every instance.  If you want to experiment with these bottles to see if they will work for you, I would suggest that you stop in at Target or Walmart.  They sell trial bottles for under $4 that come with either a latex or silicone nipple and 5 drop-in liners.  Unfortunately, the trial bottles that come with silicone nipples are the premium nursers, which are made from polycarbonate, a non-BPA-free plastic (this isn't necessarily a deal breaker for me because the milk never comes into contact with the polycarbonate).
I used these with my first daughter almost 7 years ago (although they were not BPA free back then...that was before it became a big deal I guess!)... and exclusively breastfed. I pumped my milk so dad could feed her when I was at work or college.  NEVER had any problem between bottlefeeding and breastfeeding - no nipple confusion, etc.  Gas wasn't a big problem either. They are so easy to clean - no scrubbing the bottle just drop in liners. Just have to clean the base/nipple/ring, but super easy and used to throw in the dishwasher.  Easy to store breastmilk in liners or bags and just pop them in the bottle after thawing. After 7 years could have still used my same bottles but opted to buy new ones because they were not BPA free.I also bought some AVENT bottles this time around - because that is the brand of pump I bought - and they are pretty good too. But these Playtex bottles are my go to bottle as they are SOOOO easy to clean and that is very important when you have a young, hungry, crying baby to take care of! :)
I was mistaken when I registered for these bottles... I thought I could use everything in the box for my baby when she was born.  However, I did not realize (being a new mom) that this was a sample kit with various nipples (one of each) for older and newer babies, teething babies, nipples that helped encourage latching of the breast and nipples that just plain resembled the breast.I actually would recommend that if you're a first time mom, register for this box and also pick out (seperately) two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow silicone' nipples for younger babies and two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow rubber' nipples for younger babies.First test the silicone on your little one and if your baby does not like it, does not latch on well or has a problem with silicone, try her on the rubber nipples.  After that, you'll know which nipples your baby will need and can purchase more *nipples* to go with the rest of the bottles in your kit.I would suggest you do not use the nipples that come with the kit at all... new babies should either be on silicone or rubber slow-flow nipples for younger babies.  Once you've found the typle of material he/she prefers - stick with it.  And around the age of 4-6 months, switch them to older baby nipples in that same material.Hope this review helps you!  Good luck with your little one.  :)
I'm so glad I chose the Playtex drop-ins system. It is so easy to use. I pump directly into the liners using the playtex storage set and freeze. Then I can just thaw and pop the liner onto the bottle holder and screw on the nipple. The selection of nipples was nice to have, though my guys would take any of them-he isn't picky. I haven't used the tall liners yet though, maybe that is more useful if you are formula feeding? For breastfeeding I recommend the pump and store set and you will be all ready to go!
Before I had my baby, I was thoroughly confused by all of the bottle options available. I started doing research & this one came highly recommended. Now I know why!!!! Hardly any cleaning!!!!! If you're not a complete germ phobe & not super messy while making the bottle, you rarely have to wash the bottles or rings. Just change out the drop in, wash the nipple & you're set. I've only had to wash the bottles or rings when I've accidentally gotten the formula on them. My only complaint is the "leak proof" lid. I only tried it once. Put the lid on the bottle & put the bottle in the outside side pocket of the diaper bag. Bag wasn't jostled or knocked around or anything & the bottle totally leaked. So, the "leak proof" tops are not leak proof. Still, I wouldn't use any other bottle.
When I bought this system, I was concerned if it would be compatible with the pump I chose (Ameda Purely Yours Ultra).  The answer is - only if you also buy the Playtex Breast Milk Storage Kit.  The kit comes with the adapters that you need.With respect to the nipples that come with this set, our baby eventually got used to them, but it took a few days.
I got these as a gift at my baby shower, so I haven't had a chance to use them until now. Since I'm breastfeeding, I don't use them on a regular basis, just for outings. You can't pump into these, which is a bit of a hassle, but it's not too bad. My problem with the bottle is that the bags don't stay in. The ring doesn't hold the bag in, so when I went to feed the baby, he ended up soaked. Needless to say, bottle feeding that day was a disaster. If the bag would stay in, I'd say I really liked these. Unfortunately, I haven't had one bag stay in yet...
I knew from the beginning that I would be using these bottles.  What I love is the convenience.  No bottle washing, just toss out the liner and wash the nipple.  It's especially nice when you're out and about or a long trip and cannot necessarily wash a bottle after use.  What's nice about this starter kit is that it comes with 5 different nipples of varying flows and types (latex and silicone) that I was able to try without having to purchase separately (this is good because of my complaint below).I also like the Playtex one step storage system that you can use with these bottles (refer to my review on Playtex one step storage kits: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSCK6EN7AYRA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm).  With the pump adapter that comes in the storage kits, you can pump directly into the liners.I do have a few complaints about these bottles, though:!) As I mentioned, it's nice that it came with all the different nipples because finding the best one to use with my baby was a chore and a half (refer to my reviews on the Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow latex, Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow silicone, and Playtex NaturaLatch Orthodontic Medium Flow).2) The clear liners make it difficult to see the exact amount that is in the liner if you are pumping directly into the liner, but you learn to estimate more or less.  When you're breastfeeding you have no clue the exact amount the baby is getting anyways.  If you're really anal, just pump into a regular bottle and transfer to drop-in liner.3) Although convenient, the disposable liners do create a lot of waste.  This would be my biggest complaint.Overall, happy with product because of the convenience.
Last year, in preparation to our son's arrival, we bought several leading, what I will call "bottle feeding systems" (You are not buying just bottles, but also committing yourself to the accessories specific to that brand, so they are systems).  The ones we chose to try were:-Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle-Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottles- ThesePlaytex, although in concept very appealing, we did not like because due to their design/material it is hard to get out all of the milk and so some of it always gets wasted.  Also, it is very challenging to measure out exact amounts as the numbers and gradations on the dropins is hard to see.  We stopped using these very quickly.  Although, if you are using formula that is less viscous than milk, these might be work much better.  Plus, Target sells a store version of dropins which a lot of people like, so that helps a lot with the price.Avent bottles are generally very good, and we ended up using them a lot.  Also, we purchased the ridiculesly overpricedPhilips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kitto be able to use the bottles withMedela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump.  The setup works great.  The main problem with the Avent bottles is that if you forget to put in the little ring, the milk will leak all over your child. With the ring in, we never had a leak. We have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples N-4, and the above comments apply to all variations.Dr. Brown's bottles are probably the best out of the three.  Like the Avent, we have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples 1-4.  With its design, it is harder to assemble the bottle without all the necessary pieces.  We have never had these bottles leak.  The complaints that they are hard to wash are unfounded.  We never had an issue with just throwing them in the dishwasher.  After about nine months of use, some of the markings are slightly coming off, not a big deal.  Also, the number of parts (6 vs Avent's 5 counting the lid) is not as overwhelming as some people on here claim.There seem to be no difference in any of the above bottles when it came to reducing gas.  All of them reduced some, but not all.  Likewise, our son had no preference in the nipples from one bottle to the next among these, although he absolutely hatedThe First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, so we only tried it once.If I had to pick only one of the above brands, it would be Dr. Brown's.
I have wasted so much milk using this drop-ins system.  I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners, and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter.  Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk, and believe me, I've done that many times.  I've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole, I'll only waste a little bit.  But, come on, I'm sleep deprived, and stressed and sometimes I forget, and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter, and I shouldn't have to check like that for a product I've paid for.  No good.Out of a box of 100 liners, I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak.  That's quite a lot; we're not talking one or two here.  Unfortunately, I've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples, so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I cannot afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle.  I'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter.  I would NOT recommend.
This particular starter set of Playtex Drop-Ins is a great place to start if you're looking for an economical way to sample a wide variety of nipple types and the Drop-Ins system as a whole. We did not need to purchase additional Drop-In bottles because of the quick and easy clean-up, although we did purchase extra nipples of the type our daughter preferred. We have used both the Playtex VentAire and Playtex Drop-In bottles for the past year as we switched between breastfeeding and bottle feeding with my daughter, who has just reached her first birthday. Of the two, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding, although neither has caused the dreaded "nipple confusion." In both cases, we use the slow flow variety of nipple for each bottle type. This is how the two compare:1. The Drop-Ins win hands-down for convenient clean-up and are thus our favorite to travel with. Throw out the old liner, pop in a new one, fill it up, and you're ready to go - easy to do even in the backseat of a car with a crying baby. No bottle brush or hot, soapy water needed.2. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which we have found is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).3. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle with a slow flow nipple can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle with a slow flow nipple leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). This is less of an issue if there will be parental supervision.4. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider, and if she falls asleep, the bottle is dropped and leaks wherever it lands.Both the Playtex Drop-In and Playtex VentAire bottles are nice sets, and we have appreciated having both types to choose from to enjoy the perks of both. For convenience and fast clean-up, the Playtex Drop-In system wins. For fewer leaks and more baby autonomy, the Playtex VentAire bottles get our vote.
I only used these with my first child, now 7 years old.  I am pregnant with my 2nd and with certainty, will use these again.  Why they are amazing:1.  The liners are so convenient.  You use them then throw them away.  No bottles to clean (build up of disgusting old milk, especially on those long trips outside in the spring/summer), and you don't need a lot of bottles, I had two of each (2 x 4 oz and 2 x 8 oz bottles).2.  After mixing the formula or using expressed breast milk, simply squeeze the liner from the bottom of the open-ended bottle and all the air is out!  This lessens the gas and projectile vomiting.3.  Many options of nipples and they are the only thing you need to wash/rinse/sterilize.A lot of my friends use Dr. Brown and they rave about it, but after I talk about the Platex system, they are sold.
Okay - I was one of those new moms who had no clue about which bottles of the many types to use for my baby.  I read all of the online reviews and decided I would get a couple of each type and try them all.  I have the Avent bottles, Dr. Brown's, Gerber, you name it, I have a ton of them.I exclusively breatfeed my baby and everyday he gets a bottle with his medicine in it along with the bottles I pump for when we will be somewhere that's difficult to breastfeed.  In my opinion, this system is HANDS-DOWN THE BEST.Here's what I like:The liners are sterile so you can always be sure your baby is drinking out of a clean bottle.Nothing to wash but the nipple and ring.  Its so quick and easy, especially when you are in a hurry or in the middle of the night when its harder to think straight.  When he's done, just toss the drop in and wash the nipple and you are ready for your next bottle.My baby didn't struggle with swallowing air using this bottle like the others I tried because you push the air out.  It worked much better for him than the Dr. Brown's bottles.  Using these, he didn't struggle with gas pains afterwards.He switched with no problems from a very early age between the breast and this bottle type.  It comes with various nipples to try and the breastfeeding nipple works great for him.Here is the only downside:You cannot pump directly into the liners - but that is not a big deal to me.  I pump into the Medela CSF bags and store those.  When I am ready to make a bottle, I pour it out of the CSF bag and into the liner.  It became routine and its not a problem for me to take that extra step.Good luck in making your choices about bottles for your baby but from a new mom whose tried them all, these really are the best all around.
These bottles are fantastic in reducing gas.  My 5 week old has been using them since he was 1 week old and he has much less gas and spitting up when we use them as opposed to some other brands that we have tried.  I know these bottles have been around for a long time and now I understand why..they work.  I have found most of the new modern bottles to be all gimic and no substance.  The down side to these bottles is that you have to continually buy the bags which can get pricy.  It is also a little harder to travel with them because you have to bring the bottle, the bag, the water, and the formula all separate.  Futhermore, they don't come with caps for the nipples so you have to put your finger on the nipple to shake the formula and bag the nipple to travel with it.  I would tell anyone if they have been using Dr. Brown's, Avent, or any of the other super fancy feeding systems and their kids are still having problems with gas and spitting up, they should try these.
I love these bottles and I reccomend them to everyone I know. First off you drop in a liner and that means there is less to clean up, no scrubbing the inside of the bottle. Second after I put the cap on I pinch the nipple open and gently push up on the liner and all the air comes out. That means the bottle won't give the baby gas! I also used the natural action nipple which the baby loved. I was also able to wash the nipple, the bottle and the ring in the top rack of the disheasher in a speacial  nipple rack I bought at walmart for $5. No fuss and minimal clean up.
These cloth diapers are reasonably priced and include a padded middle.  They should do the trick for those using cloth diapers.  They also work as burp cloths for those using disposable diapers.
These burp clothes are extremely thin.  They are so gauzy that you can see through them, so they won't even work for a game of "peek-a-boo"!  These were not thick enough for me to use as a burp cloth, let alone the "premium" diaper it is touted to be.  These would not work in our house even as a dish cloth, let alone absorbing any type of baby mess!The only reason I didn't give only a single star is because Gerber was very nice about giving me a refund on these - they guarantee all their products.  I just don't think they described accurately what you are getting.  They are definitely not the diaper service quality, however, if you don't have 3 different levels of diapers to choose from at your local store, how would you even know that there were different grades of diapers when it says "premium" on the package?  They need to be more descriptive in their product packaging.  For burp cloths, I prefered the Kooshie baby brand which are very absorbant, very soft and durable as well.
This is a great value pack and so soft and thick in the center panel which also makes them great burp cloths instead of using more expensive and also narrower and thinner cloths actually marketed for the burp cloths.
These are by far the BEST burp cloths around.  I got several different kinds at my baby shower.  I ordered these after reading the reviews because the ones I received at the shower were paper thin.  These are fabulous.  I buy them for every baby shower I go to now.  The middle panel is very thick and helps with a newborn that spits up a lot and those breastfeeding blunders that happen to a new mom.  I highly recommend them.  They are worth the money.
I love these cloth diapers. I use them everyday to care for my newborn. I mostly use them as burp cloths and as extra protection for the changing pad during diaper changes. They wash up great. I would highly recommend these cloth diapers.
I got 2 of these at my baby shower (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) and I absolutely love them! They steam pretty quick and I like how you can keep pre-measured water on it. When baby's hungry I just grab the bottle from the fridge, grab the little flask of water that's attached, pour it in, and press the button. I've had to warm bottles twice sometimes but it's still faster than warming water on the stove or running the bottle under the faucet. Oh, I only do 2 oz. bottles for now.
I have been using this product for almost 7 months and yes, its true the little cups DO NOT WORK for warming bottles, I tried them for 1 week until I started using my own cup and I just pour the water in and now I know about how long it will take to warm, works great for me. I never had a problem with scalding my baby's mouth because I always check the milk temperature on my hand BEFORE giving it to the baby. Overall, I live in a two-story house and this warmer is a lifesaver for those early am feedings, I definitely don't want to go downstairs to warm a bottle, the product works consistently if you figure out how much water you need.
I think this product was a waste of money our daughter will not wait for bottle to heat  up in this and its just easier and faster to make a fresh bottle.
Our nursery is on a different floor as the kitchen, so having this has been great for night feeding of twins. The little ice bottle is kind of lame, it really should be Blue Ice which stays frozen longer. Otherwise great product, easy to use, easy to clean.
I can't speak highly enough about this chiller/warmer.  Every night I know I will not have to go downstairs to get a bottle, warm it, and bring it back up while baby is crying.Now, all I do is take the bottle from the chill compartment (complete with ice pack), and place it, with a capful of premeasured water, in the warming compartment and hit a button.While I change baby's diaper, the bottle is warming, and I am ready to go.  This equipment has been a godsend.  Actually, I can't think of any equipment that I could live without less.No complaints whatsoever about this great bottle warmer.
This is a lifesaver for late night feelings. We just pop a bottle or two in the cooler before bed, and within 5 minutes of baby waking in the middle of the night bottle is ready to go. We keep in it in the bedroom so we don't have to even leave our room for late night feelings.
We have two of these - one for upstairs and downstairs. We've been using this for a month and it works ok. The warmer is a bit of a crap shoot as far as the bottle temperatures... but it's never under-heated a bottle. At worst some bottles come out too hot. That's easily  remedied by running the bottles under cool water for a minute or two. Also - when I first got the bottles I would heat my plastic bottles in there. They seemed fine and didn't melt but I quickly switched to using only glass bottles in the warmer. It just doesn't seem right to be heating plastic on a heat source!Now the only down side to this is the cooler. It does keep things cool - but it's not impressive. It will keep things cool for up to 8 hours - but don't mistake this for being refrigerated cool. My medela breast pump tote came with a better ice pack - and that's what we're using to keep the bottles cold at night. One other trick... keep the cooler portion away from the heating portion if you want things to stay cool all night. If you keep it on the unit your bottles will warm up.All in all - this is definitely a good purchase and I'm not sorry I bought this.
We love it. Once we figured out how to use it for bottles and bottles of baby food. Very convenient.
Ehh, I bought this product to avoid my MIL using the microwave to heat bottles. The thing is that it really depends on the amount of milk and size of bottle. The warmer starts right away and creates a lot of steam. What i found is that a cold bottle from fridge would heat up a lot on the outside but a couple shakes and it would still be cold. I didnt find it evenly heated it through.Its still best to just sit it in hot water for a couple mins. :)But we will use this to keep cool bottles in the freezer pack in the back (remember to freeze the ice pack)-Overall, save your money and use the traditional method.
If you are pumping breast milk or formula feeding this thing is a lifesaver.  We've used this warmer for 2 of our babies and love it.  It's super convenient to have 2 bottles nice and chilled.  If you read the instructions the warming is pretty much fool-proof but on occasion I've been sleepy and overwarmed a bottle.  As I rule I always test the temperature anyway so it's never been a real problem.  Make sure your lids are off or loosened when you warm the bottles (especially Dr. Brown's) or the milk will come out of the top and make breast milk caramel all over the heating element.  :)
I purchased this bottle warmer for my second baby because it was a life saver for my daughter.  It stores 2 bottles in the compartment and comes with a small ice pack.  Do not store milk with this ice pack for more than eight hours.  The pack is fairly small and does not cool the milk for long.  I use a freezer pack and store one bottle at a time.  I would add a time chart just to know approximately how much time it takes to heat up a bottle.
I can honestly say I love this bottle warmer because it is very convenient for those in a 2-story house.  We loved being able to keep the bottle cool and save the trip downstairs in the middle of the night.  Even when my son was sleeping through the night we still kept his morning bottle in his room and used this warmer to keep it cool.  But...I was very disappointed that my Dr. Brown's bottles were too wide for the warmer.  The taller Dr. Brown's bottle fit in the warmer but were too tall to fit in the cooler.  I ended up still using the cooler but storing the Dr. Brown's bottles in there without the nipple and cap on so they would fit.  My only suggestion would be to make the warmer wider so all bottles can fit.
I really did not like this.  We had a warmer that submerses the bottle in water, and we found this worked faster and better.  We got this as a second hoping to use it upstairs at night.  Decided to just buy a second warmer that uses water, and to use a cooler for the bottles (our baby needed 4 anyway to get through the night)
I loved this product from the moment I got it. It works wonders with drop ins, And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely.... Sometimes that is. We have been using this with ourDr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile. Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate.... Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently. We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day, four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over. Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish. The instructions are basically nonexistent. All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities.
We bought this because I work 2nd shift at a hospital so on the days I work, I don't get home until midnight and my husband has to get up with the baby. We exclusively breastfeed, so it's not like we can just put warm water in a bottle and mix it with formula. Living in a two story house, it's not exactly fun to get up in the middle of the night, go downstairs, warm up the water, then the bottle and go back upstairs to the baby. This system alleviates all of that!! We just put it in our upstairs bathroom with a bottle of breastmilk in the cooler part and when the baby gets hungry, just put water in the wamer and warm the bottle. It's quick and easy, which is always good in the middle of the night!!Some people said they had problems with temperature, but we didn't have any problems. Just read the instructions for the type of bottle system we use and it worked fine!!!
I purchsed this product because of the cooling capabilities as it was perfect for night feedings instead of running downstairs to make a bottle in the middle of the night.  We loved it for the first month we had it.  BUT, after just about a month of use (warming 3 or 4 bottles per day) the warmer started over heating the bottles and sent milk pouring out of the top.  I use a variety of types of bottles and specifically the Dr. Browns and the First Years Breastflow bottles were overheated and thus overflowed in this warmer.  (The Advent bottles did not overflow but were so hot to the touch I couldn't take them out with my bare hands and thus was NOT going to put the bottle near my infant until it cooled down which tool 5 or more minutes.) We played with the amount of water we were using, thinking we were putting too much in (even though we were following the recommended water usage in the instructions).  That didn't help.  After having the product for less than 2 months we are returning it to the vendor where it was purchsed.  I would not recommend gettin this product.  First Years needs to go back to the drawing board on this one and come out with a product that actually works.
Easy to use, cooler works well to store 2 bottles. I've been using it for 5 oz medela bottles so I pump at night, cap it and store it in the cooler and warm as I use it. Works great!
I bought this bottle warmer, because the previous model from the same company broke. When I got the new version of "The First Years Night and Day Warmer System", I was shocked on how short the electric cord was. I was also displeased with having to unplug it, in order, to turn it off. I am not happy with the new model. I would try a different brand, if you need a bottle warmer.
We had this warmer with our first child, but had parted ways with it by the time we had another child. We got the Tommee Tippee bottle warmer with our second child (because we used the tommee tipped bottles with her). After only a few months, I have gone back to this warmer. I love that it has the auto-off feature (which the TT one did not have). heats the bottles very quickly and you don't have to stand over it checking the temp every minute like with the TT warmer. Overall, I love this warmer.
This product is a major piece of garbage. You will NEVER get your milk to the right temperature no matter how hard you try. It will either be cold or it will be scalding hot. Also it creates a smell that smells like burnt hair which is worrisome considering others who reviewed this product (at least 4 people) said that it catches on fire. We were using dr. browns 2 and 4 oz bottles and sometimes the 2 oz would be cold while the 4 oz would  be way too hot. We always ended up using the tap to correct the temperature and it took forever. We just bought the dr browns delux bottle warmer and its AMAZING! It remembers how long it takes to warm any particular amount and you dont have to fill it up with water every time the way you do with this. Remove from your registry, return, or throw away if you have bought this product and go with the dr browns instead.
Couldn't ask for a better pump! Does everything I need! For my daughters first month of life, she couldn't latch on correctly so I pumped and fed her via bottle. No problems with this pump. I love it.
This pump says it's rated for only occasional use, but I used it every day for six months.  The main thing I like about this pump is the ability to use it in any situation.  My husband and I traveled quite a bit with our son and I was able to pump in the car with the battery pack.  I use it so much that I doubt it will make it to our next child, but it's much better to buy this one twice for $80 than to buy one for $350!
I purchased this pump for occasional use since I am a sahm.  As recommended by our lactation consultants, I pump once a day.  I sit in bed with my daughter nursing on one side and me pumping the other.  I am able to get 6-8oz in one sitting.  When I pump w/o nursing at the same time, I am still able to get 4oz in 15-20 mins. Being a sahm, I cannot justify spending the $200 for a double pump when I just don't need that much help.I highly recommend this if you are a sahm and can pump whenever for however long.  I pump once a day and after a week of that I have 2 weeks worth of feedings(if giving once a day).
I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:TRY THIS ONE IF...- You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended periodINVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF...- You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one).
I received this pump as a gift.  I like it because it is electric.  I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading.  For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis.  However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump.  This works great.  It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples.  Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples.  It is a pretty good buy.  It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it.  :)
I love this pump!  It's the best single pump I've tried, and I've had a few different ones.
I bought this pump before leaving the hospital and it was a waste of money. It hurt like heck and did not express enough milk to relieve my engorgement. The motor cycles very slowly so when it's tugging on me all I can think is ouch...ouch...ouch... I ended up buying a used Pump-in-Style online and love it. I can pump both sides at once in less than 10 minutes and have a good-sized bottle to show for it.
I'm pretty sure I first bought this pump when I had my first 6yrs ago.  I only used it a couple of times then - we never got the nursing thing to work out.  When my second came along, I pulled out this pump and used it regularly for almost a year. (expressing away from home, helping with engorgement, pumping extra for more supply)It works great!  (Especially if you may be on a budget)  Yes, I know the motor is loud, and it took a little while for me to get used to it - but if that is something you can get past or it just doesn't bother you, this single breast pump is fantastic for the price.  (if you want a quiter one, look at the Medela Swing, but you also pay more)  It only took only 15-20 minutes to pump what my baby could nurse in the same amount of time.I mostly used the AC adapter, but I have taken it on the road and away from home quite a few times with batteries (2 AA if I remember?) and it worked just as well.  I have never had problems with burning through batteries, they always lasted a long time, so long that I started using batteries while at home too so I wasn't stuck in one place.If I still had this laying around, I would also use it with our 3rd, who is expected in 2 mos.  But I have no idea if we gave it away to someone else, or where else it may have went to over the years.  I do plan on upgrading to the Medela Swing this time, and only for the noise factor.  My kids are 4 and 6yrs now, and with the activity level in my home now, I think a quieter model will better suite everyone's needs.
I found this gate hard to set up - the instructions weren't as clear as I would have liked and did not mention to remove the vertical bars before trying to adjust sections.  (I am a minor DIYer).It's great once it's in place, though!  It is very sturdy and the gate is easy to open if you have a free hand.
We have a soon to be 5 month old and he is not crawling yet but we wanted to be prepared.  Our stairs needed a special gate and this is perfect for us.  We especially love the fact that you can take the entire gate off when not needed and it's easy to put up and take down.  Thanks to Little Folks and Amazon!
We needed a gate for a really wide space between our family room and kitchen and this gate works perfectly.  It doesn't look terribly cheesy.  The gate is easy to open and close, but not so easy that our toddler can figure it out.
We got *seven* extensions for this and put a fence across our den, marking off a one-hundred-square-foot area for the lil'guy to crawl around in. I was worried that the length would make it insecure, but it doesn't: Just be sure not to have the fence completely straight; use the nifty connection corners to alternate turns, using either angles back and forth or a serpentine pattern. Then hang stuff like toys, instruments, and mobiles from it. Our lil'guy loves it! :)
We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area.  We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate.The elongate was to cover an area of 84".  The elongate can only go straight across and opening.  It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across.  We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates.  Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour.The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs.It was so easy to add the extension piece on.  You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece.  You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening.To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on.  It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes.  It was very sturdy.I highly recommend this gate.
It's pricy, but very sturdy.  To open and close gate is little tricky though.  I purchased Northyard gate also.  I like it better.
We've had this gate since late 2007 when our oldest started walking.  Fast forward to home# 2 and three running , half-heathen boys.  The gate has stood-up to our abuse, the elements (having been outdoors since first acquired), and the dismantling and ressembly due to a move.We've never had a problem opening or closing the gate and find the opening more than adequate.  My larger friends due as well.We did buy another Hearthgate to section off our family room from the rest of the house and yes, the mounting screws are coming out of the walls.  but, I'd like to preface, that is because I didn't use drywall mounts to attach the gate to the walls. I desperately needed a gate ASAP since our new house had a narrow, metal spiral staircase with a gate which didn!t latch( yes, we immediately rectified our spiral staircase gate sitch and now have a key lock on it!)..  So As soon as I got the gate home, I installed it.  After almost two years of dogs nosing it, kids hanging on it, people pushing on it, the screws are finally beginning to come out of the wall.  Tomorrow, I'm headed to the hardware store for some drywall mounts.After all the gates we've been through, I still think this gate is the best.  Installation for both gates was a breeze.Customer service was great as well.  I installed it while kids were napping.  I had to call the company after We received the wrong extension piece( wrong gate piece in extension piece's box)Oh, FYI: even after all these years, our original hearthgate doesn't show any signs of rust.
This is a great gate, and one of the few with the flexibility to accommodate non-straight spaces. It's pretty sturdy, the kids shake it sometimes but it hasn't ever opened or torn from the wall. The downside (or upside, depending on perspective) is that the gate is harder to open than the previous version. The magnetic catch is handy for a quiet but easy close. I got the extension, and it still stands pretty sturdy. No regrets on the purchase.BTW, this gate works really well as a separate space for an older child to play. We use it for my 3 year old to have a space on the main floor to play with toys without the baby able to interrupt. It's nice because he feels included with everyone else there, but doesn't get upset by his brother knocking down or taking his legos. Highly recommend for that purpose. Looks ok, good if you have white for trim, but ultimately, its a baby gate and looks like one.
This kidco configure gate is worth every penny if you need to enclose and odd shaped space!  We needed to block off a hallway in our basement, but had uneven walls, and this gate works perfectly.  The installation was a little bit involved, since you have to screw the brackets into studs in the walls, but it only took about 20 minutes and we had it up.Some tips for installing the gate:1.  First, read through the entire instruction manual before you start.  The way the manual is structured, there are instructions in several languages in the front, and then reference pictures in the back.  If you read through the manual and flip back and forth until you understand the pictures before you start, it makes the installation go pretty smoothly.2.  Try to mount the brackets to studs in your walls.  Since you can configure the gate to any length/angle by changing the angle of each joint, try to configure it so that you can mount each bracket to a stud in the wall, so you don't have to worry about energetic kids pulling them out.3.  Try to configure the gate so that each joint is at least at a 10 degree angle.  If you put them straight across, the gate will flex a little bit.  It doesn't really affect the stability of the gate since it is anchored to the walls, but the flexing will go away if you angle each sectionOverall, this gate worked for enclosing our odd shaped space perfectly and I would highly recommend it!
We have used this gate since our oldest started moving around. Now 3 years and another child later it is still functioning great! It still looks and works as well as on day 1.We picked this for the top of our stairs so we could have a "landing" at the top. We did not like other gates where you have to balance on the top stair, with a baby in your arms, to open or close the gate.It is easy to open, but not for little ones. My 3.5 year old still cannot open this on his own.I would buy this same gate in a heartbeat.
This item was a LIFESAVER when I brought my son home from the hospital. The sounds were so soothing they helped him to sleep longer at night. For anyone who has read Dr. Harvey Karp's book, The Happiest Baby on the Block, they will understand. The only thing is this is better for smaller babies. Once my son was bigger, I bought the Fisher Price Aquarium and that works well for older babies.
The only good thing about this is the night light function.  The waves and water sound horrible and my son never liked listening to the music or the heartbeat sound.
The voice activated feature is great!!And for what it offers, the price is very attractive.Four sounds, light, etc. - you will be glad you bought it.Our daughter can't sleep without it now :)
I wouldn't rate this as a baby necessity. It was nice to have at times, but our baby was never really addicted to it. I used the sounds as background noise when she was an infant, but not all the time. I was afraid she would get hooked on sleeping with white noise and wouldn't sleep any other way. The light was very helpful. I used that all the time for middle-of-the-night nursing sessions. It is very dim, so it is not bright enough to realy wake up baby (or you!) but you can see enough to avoid fumbling around.
I was a little woried about buying a metal crib, but because it was mutch cheeper than the wooden moddles I baught this one. I love it and so does my son. We have had it for over a year. It hs traveled with us, Surved as play pin, and iven was used as the main crib for 3 monthes while we have no room for a big crib. I do wish it were a little easier to fold and ajust, although the litle buttons are stuck in mine it still works and is very safe. Should offer maybe 1 mor hight? I like that the bottom of the ligs are removeable, the description doesn't say that.
I bought this because my daughter has hated the pack n play from day one. She is now 13 months old and it was a major battle at each travel destination. When we decided to leave her with grandma for a few nights we knew we needed a crib.  This one is great because it is very sturdy.  The folding locks take a bit of getting used to, but they work well.  The mattress is thin and we purchased a mattress for it for about $20.  I bought portable crib sheets at Babies R Us and they work great.  My daughter sleeps in this like her regular crib and I think we will get a lot of use from it! It does fold nice and flat, but it is still large for the average car. We can put it in our Suburban.  It would be nice if they made one that has sides that fold in half for storage, but no one does! I love this crib.
great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!) My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal! I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib. And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart.
My husband and I bought this changing table in the "cherrywood". It wasn't hard to put together--my husband put it together in a 1/2 hr or so.  It provides ample space for diapers, burp clothes, blankets, and other items you may need on it.  The table comes with a simple foam mattress, which is easily wiped off with a cloth.  We've been using it everyday for nearly 16 months, and still good as new.  No problems encountered at all.
I bought this for my 6 week old daughter because the price was nice and the table was attractive. I tried to put it together and I could not figure it out! It does not seem very sturdy at all and I would be worried putting her on it. I am returning it back to the store. My sister has the same table and her's is fine. Maybe I just picked up a bad one.
This is a good solid dressing table.  We received it because my in-laws found it at a consignment shop, so I can't comment about other reviewers' concerns regarding assembly.  The table serves the purpose and is a good value for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on a dressing table.  We didn't feel that we needed a fancy dressing table and instead opted to purchase a more expensive crib, which is really the focal point of the nursery.  The dressing table has two shelves that are quite convenient for holding supplies.  I placed baskets on those shelves to hold diapers, etc.
I have had this from the day my daughter came home from the hospital and it has held up in the wash. No major accidents on it but the few there were are due to my not folding up the stinky diapers all the way or her spitting up. Washes well and never shrunk for me. If you are washing it on warm your water temp may be too high(hot water heater) so that may be causing it to shrink. I love mine and it is softer now then first use and it is secure so she does not slide like when we tried a towel on the changing pad.Have had the same 2 since February and look like new. Would have given this 5 stars but this is not as soft as I had hoped...maybe expecting alot from terry cloth.
My son is three weeks old, and I am using this pump every day to express milk for his middle-of-the-night feedings. It is so much easier to use and more comfortable than the Medela pump they had me using in the hospital to increase my supply.It seems very complicated to put together the first couple of times, and it took me a little practice to get to where I had the pump (and myself) positioned properly to get consistent suction. But once you get the hang of it (give it 3-5 sessions to get used to it), it works great. I can pump enough for an entire feeding in 20-25 minutes.It does occasionally lose suction when I am using it because the soft plastic massaging attachment comes loose from the hard body of the pump. This requires me to stop momentarily but isn't a huge deal, just a minor annoyance. And it seems that the more I get used to the pump, the less this happens.This morning, I was even able to hold my fussing baby on one arm while pumping with my free hand. Talk about convenient....The lactation consultant who taught my breastfeeding class said this pump is so popular that Medela is now trying to copy the design.Considering the price, I'd rate it an outstanding buy.
I bought this pump because I am an at home mom and don't need anything quicker.  I saw no need to spend the extra money to save time when I have plenty of it.  Plus, once your milk really start to come in and your baby has been breast feeding for a few months, the milk really flows.  It wasn't especially useful for the first few months because expressing was just not feasible yet without a hospital grade pump.  Now that it is, I love this pump.  It doesn't hurt my nipples, and the small breast milk storage containers fit right on the pump.  My daughter still only drinks about 3-4 ounces at a time so I mainly use those.  I bought the disposable one because it came with the storage bags and the bottle to hold them.  I thought they would be useful for when I need to have more than 4 ounces.  The bags hold 7 and are very easy to thaw.  This breast pump is definitely worth the money.
I was hoping for more of a pad feel to make my baby's mattress softer but this is more like a waterproof cover with some quilting as an afterthought. Didn't make the matress any softer.
This pad makes our 1 year old daughter's Colgate classic mattress not feel so hard, but at the same time it is thin enough and seems safe for younger babies. I'm very glad I bought it!
This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket. There was nothing &#34;UltraSoft&#34; or &#34;UltraThick&#34; about this mattress pad, if you could call it that. It's probably the first amazon purchase, after a couple hundred, that really left me disappointed. You're better off putting a thick, soft blanket under your baby's crib sheet if padding is what you're going for. As a mattress protector, it might be good. As a quilted pad to make it softer- it's useless. The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to. My 7 month old wouldn't have even noticed a difference. He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he's older. Guess I'll have to keep looking.
This fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  We didn't have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  The crib sheet alone wasn't enough to keep him from sweating.  This pad is also not too bulky so it doesn't cause a safety concern.  Just make sure the pad fits TIGHTLY on YOUR crib mattress for safety's sake.  We have a Sealy Crown Jewel Mattress and it fits great on it.
This mattress pad is waterproof. That is all I need. It goes in the washer and the dryer. Not only that it is thick and fluffy, like a good quality mattress cover should be to add softness and quality of sleep to a bed. I only need one. It's QUITE a necessity.
Fits the mattress well & Holds up well in the wash. I actually bought this b/c my toddler's new bedding set showed his mattress design too much. This was my solution and he seemed to love it too! :)
Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking. They are correct! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers, I think there must be a problem with production. Maybe some are leaky, some are not. Fact is, out of ten bottles, five of mine were leaky. I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex. They are half the cost and never leak
These worked good for about 3 weeks and they started to leak. I went to the Avent website and they said that I was overtightening the bottles and that was causing the leak. Well less tightening did not help. Don't waste money. I am using the Playtex Premium Nurser now and it's much better.
these bottles proved to be better than any other bottle.  myb baby gets much less gas from these than any other on the market.  its definately worth the price.  i have bought and wasted money on so many different brands of bottles.  dont waste your money and just go exclusivly with these.
I bought these bottles after reading reviews on them and have been pretty happy with them. They have never leaked with me BUT I have never screwed the lid on too tightly. You HAVE to remember that. When you overtighten the lid, the nipple gets distorted and the seal is broken. My husband and others in the family have had this problem. It is probably always helpful to test for leaks (when you test the temp of the milk) BEFORE you give it to the baby, just to make sure.I like the plastic they use. It has always felt extremely sturdy. They are easily to hold (thanks to the curve) and I really like the wide mouth of the bottles which make them easy to clean....and you are pretty sure they are clean!!I bought the newborn starter set and the infant set and together they are all I require for bottles and a breastmilk storage set!!All in all I think they were a great buy and worth it. I would use them all over again and would use avent with my next baby too.
These bottles are a good choice if you're breastfeeding, but have to introduce a bottle. My son has never had a problem going from the breast to this bottle and back to the breast again.Also, after months of frequent use, I have never experienced the leaking problem with these bottles mentioned by some other reviewers. I also know of other moms who have used these for more than a year and no leaks either. I have even taken the tops apart and put them back together and still no leaks.
Wanted to use the Avent line, but baby just wouldn't take this nipple.  Went with Playtex ventaire natural instead.  Looks like a science lab...but baby switches easily from breast to bottle.
I wouldn't use any other kind of bottle for several reasons:1- they work great with the avent breast pump.2- They have wide mouth openings and this makes it easier to clean the bottle as well as dump formula or breast milk into the opening.3- The nipples are silicon and this is very important to me since I understand from my research silicon nipples are less apt to cause breastfeeding nipple confusion.4- The nipples seem to mimic a breast more than any other nipple on a bottle I have seen. I was concerned about nipple confusion for the few times I wanted to bottle feed instead of breast feed and I understand that these are some of the best available that mimic a mother's breast.5- We have noticed that our children have less gas when they use these bottles rather than a normal, cheap type bottle. (maybe it's our imagination, but we think that this is the case.)6- the whole avent system makes for easy growing with the child- there are different nipples for different ages, including a sippy cup nipple. Great.These bottles are great. My husband sometimes screws a lid on wrong and gets shaking it and formula leaks out the sides. This is only when he doesn't screw the lid on correctly. I have never had this problem.We wouldn't use any other type of bottle. They are well worth the money.
Don't bother buying these if you want your baby to take in less air.  Go with the Dr. Brown's.  My kids actually ingested more air b/c of the nipple shape - they just couldn't get their mouths around the large base.Reasons I give 2 stars:-well-made-easy to clean
I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles. I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage. Needless to say none worked. Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles. I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones. First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened.  There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby. The bottles are by far not cheap and there shouldn't be so many issues.  I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well...too bad they didn't tell me before I registered for them.  Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the .99 cent store you don't have all these issues.  When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well.  I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls.  In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating.  I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle.
After trying Dr. Brown's, Playtex, and even the cheap bottles, Avent bottles have come to my rescue.  First of all, they have many different flows with their nipples, which is a huge plus in my book.  The Playtex have 3 - slow, fast, and tri-cut.  Avent has newborn stage 1, stage 2 (slow), medium (+3 months), and fast (+6 months), plus a tri-cut.  I have NEVER had a problem with the nipples clogging, even after putting them in the dishwasher a few times (I had this problem with all other nipples).My 3 month old daughter can finish a 6 oz bottle in 10 minutes instead of the 45 it took with the other bottles.  Also, I have never ever had a problem with leaking, I think many other moms who do are probably not reading the directions or using common sense.  If you tighten ANY bottle too tight, it will leak.  And the nipple has a special seal that you can hear when you turn it, so that will prevent leaking.There's no extra parts to wash like Dr. Browns, and they do not give my daughter gas.  In fact, my daughter will burp better now than with her other bottles.  She also prefers the wide-mouth shape and I know it gives her mouth the needed motion to widen her palatte (which is one of the reasons breastfeeding is recommended.)  We ended up selling all the other ones to our local baby consignment shop and spent the money on more Avent bottles.
They leak like mad... and although you tell yourself you must be doing something wrong because no bottle should leak this much, it's not your fault. It's these idiotic bottles! I can't imagine how they passed any kind of testing when they were being made. Please don't buy them, it is a huge waste of money!
I purchsed these bottles on a recommendation from a friend who was breast feeding as well.  The fact that the nipples were to more mimic the breast than others was great and the fact that you could use the bottles as storage containers when pumping was even better.  When I first had my daughter, we had to put her on a bottle a week after she was here to help me have time to heal.  She was getting one bottle a day and was having no problem going back and forth from breast to bottle regularly.  The nipples are great because they force the baby to suck on them as if they were the breast.  The nipples are not supposed to be shaped as the breast but force the baby to latch the way they do on the breast.  I swear by these bottles ans will not change to any other bottles for her!
These are the widest bottles that I have seen available.  They are well made and easy to assemble.  I sterilise mine every day and there has been no fading of level markers (a problem with another make I tried.) or discolouration of bottles.  They come with a whole range of accessories like handles and sippy cup teats for older babies and so will go from Day 1 right through to when you no longer need sippy cups.  The best thing for me is the fact that you can get specially designed teats that allow for thicker liquids (my son had rice in his milk at 8 weeks (with Doctors approval) because he is so big (90th Percentile) and was so very hungry.  The Adjustable Flow teat has a slot cut instead of a hole and so the flow depends on the way the teat is lined up with the babies nose.  What a fantastic idea and such a godsend for us.  They also hook up directly to an avent breast pump either the manual or electric.
HI, I HAD THESE BOTTLES BACK IN 2002 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL GAVE THEM TO US TO USE TO FEED THE BABY. I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT MORE WHEN I GOT HOME, I HAD NOTHING BUT LEAKY PROBLEMS!!! I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO "TALK ABOUT IT" I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING. THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY. THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN. I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED!!! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CANNOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET!!! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT, NOT, NOT, BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES!!!
We bought this because this is a good brand to use.  We love how big these are and they are so easy for someone to mix formula in.
These bottles are very finicky and if you do not put them together just right they will leak... not drip... POUR out all over the floor, and if it is breast milk that is gushing out of the bottle you may just be crying too!I ended up with a full set of these bottles (without the ring) and one that required the ring (which I felt leaked less), I could never justify going out and buy all new bottles, so I dealt with these for 11 months. I have now weaned my son off of these and onto a sippy cup because I just could not deal any longer!What's the trick? Well, the nipple has these three little lines on it and inside the screw on part there are solid parts and slotted parts (sorry if this doesn't make sense). You have to line up the lines on the nipple with the solid parts on the bottle top. This requires two hands, so you will also need to find a place to put down your screaming baby while you concentrate and get it all lined up perfectly. Once you have them lined up, now screw on the top. You have to make sure it is nice and tight. Now, shake it and see.... it leaks! It is because when you screw the top onto the bottle the nipple shifts and turns as you screw it on tight, so all that time you spent lining up the holes with the slots is garbage. Take it off and try again. Finally you will get it right and only then can you give the bottle to your starving child.I cannot wait to throw them all in the trash.
i have zero complaints about these bottles. wish i had bought them in the first place (i started out with the playtex nurser system). they may be pricy compared to other bottles, but, you don't have to buy liners for these bottles. my daughter found these bottles much easier to hold herself than the playtex ones and these have a bigger selection of nipple flow to choose from (besides slow and fast, where fast for playtex really just means not so slow), so i put them away and got more of these, and my daugher was a much happier baby.what i found with the leaking some people complain about: if there is any liquid in the seal it will leak. this problem can easily be solved by wiping the inside of the ring that holds the nipple and the outside rim of the bottle with a dry rag, and if it squeaks when you screw the lid on, you're not going to have any leaks.hope this helps!
Sent me 3 bottles one of which didn't have a lid in the box.  Crappy quality control.  Just buy them at the store for more money, at least you'll get all the parts with it.  5 stars for avent, -5 stars for seller.
In my opinion the Avent bottle system is superior to any other product on the market. The disposable system works great for storing and freezing milk and it's convenient for Mom's on the go. My only mistake was not buying enough bottles in the beginning when my son ate eight times a day. The bottles are designed to reduce gas, and seem to do the job. The one slight annoyance with the system, you have to place the ring on the lids directly on top of the nipples; otherwise the bottle has a tendency to leak.F.Y.I. - I purchased the adjustable flow nipples when my son turned three months old as recommended, but nowhere in the product information does it tell you that you are supposed to line-up the Roman numerals of the nipples directly in line with your baby's nose to adjust the flow. This makes sense of course, but I had to call the 1-800 number to discover this 'little' detail.
I decided to breastfeed my second son,when that didn't work out, I used playtex nursers.  We often fell asleep while he was eating and would wake up SOAKED in formula.  Not a good thing because formula stains and then you have to change baby and you in the middle of the night (and pretreat clothes and wash them if you didnt want to end up replacing them).I decided to try these after seeing an add in a magazine.  THESE WORKED WONDERFULLY! No more buying and changing liners (which by the way would always break even if i was being VERY careful when i "burped" the bottle...its hard enough to burp baby without trying to BURP a bottle!  I never had to burp my avent bottles.  They never leaked for me.  And I rarely had to change the nipple which hold up very well to repeated dishwashings! If you think about it these really are cheaper then playtex nursers as you dont have to buy the liners and worry about them breaking and getting formula all over yourself in the mall and then having no formula and having to leave anyways...
Our baby seems to drink the best from these bottles.  I like them because the wide mouth makes it easy to fill and clean.  I've noticed leaking a couple times and just rescrewed the cap and it was fine.
Both bottles do a fine job of keeping bubbles out of your baby.  We tried and used both bottles with our boy.  The real deal between the two is the nipple.  The nipple on Avent bottles are larger at the base and firmer than the Brown bottles.  When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles.  He just couldn't get comfortable around the nipple.  We switched to Dr. Bown's and he took to it with little problem.  As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents.  Why did we switch?  Cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles SUCKS!  There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles.  Plus, the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just don't seem to pack away as well.  However, if your baby is picky there isn't much you can do.  For expecting parents, I would not recommend buying a bunch of one type over the other.  Buy one of each first and see which one you baby is comfortable with.
The Avent bottles are great if you breastfeed, but I would caution you not to put them in your dishwasher.  All of my 9oz bottles have cracks in them because of the dishwashing detergent (according to Avent).  I called Cascade and they told me the manufacturer of the dishwasher is to blame.  On any account, Cascade and Avent both recommend using a gentle, not antibacterial soap on these bottles.  If you notice star like cracks on your bottles call Avent's customer service.
These bottles are Great! I've never had a problem with any of my bottles leaking. My daughter loves these bottles she's already strating to try to hold bottles herself while I am feeding her. I love them too since they are easy to clean and handle. I highly recommend this collection of bottles.
The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her. It isn't great for infants that are nursing...My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her. Not only was she gagging, but she just didn't like the nipple. I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it. I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since, and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle.
I bought these bottles before my daughter was born and have never regretted it.  I have NEVER had a problem with the bottles leaking and my baby is very happy.  She doesn't have gas problems or gas pains.  She loves drinking from the bottles and refuses to drink from any other bottle.  These bottles are great!
We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time.  We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved! No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings.  The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings.  So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants.  Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire.
I went through 4 different bottle systems (and a lot of $$) - and I'm sticking with Avent.  Easy to clean - easy to use - no problems.
These bottles were terrible for us.  They leaked no matter how many times I tried and followed the directions.  They also did not keep my daughter from being gassy.  As soon as we changed her bottles to the Dr. Browns she slept through the night with no wake ups.  I was not a big fan of these bottles and neither was my daughter.
I am breastfeeding currently but I do like to leave the house every so often. When I get the chance I'll pump directly into one of these bottles using the Isis pump. I love the nipples of this bottle because they are the most like the human nipple and my baby has not developed nipple confusing because of this. One thing that all Avent users should know...if you read the directions carefully for the pump, the makers tell you not to use anti-bacterial soap on any of their products. Doing so can cause the plastic to crack. I just wash all the parts as directed using regular dish soap and then sterilize all the parts using the Avent sterilizer. That too is convenient and easy to use.I would recommend these bottles to any woman who is breastfeeding and will have to return to work. Yes, they cost more than most bottles, but if you can afford that little extra you will be very pleased with the results.
I have been using these bottles for about 5 months now.  I really like them.  They do leak on occasion for me, usally when I do not have the top screwed on right.  I find that if the seal between the nipple & the bottle is not right, then you will get a leak.  I solve this problem by just unscrewing the nipple/lid and then rescrewing it on SLOWLY so I know it is getting a good tight even seal.  This always works!
These bottles just didn't work for my baby. We tried and tried for 3 and 1/2 months to get my baby to take these bottles but it just didn't work. My baby is mostly breastfed, and is only given a bottle occasionally, so I didn't give up on these bottles right away, just thinking that he wasn't used to the bottles and that's why he was having a tough time.  My mom babysat and she has raised nine kids, all who were bottlefed, so she is an expert. She said to me that the baby just really can't use this nipple. He chews on it and couldn't suck properly, the nipple seemed to hard for him. He couldn't latch on right and all the milk would spill out the sides of his mouth. Well, I take anything she says seriously! After investing alot of time and money in Avent, I decided to scrap them and start over. I went out and found a nipple that was closest to his pacifier that he loves. I found Gerber Nuk nipples, got four of them for about $4 and bought Especially for Baby bottles for a whopping $2.99 (you get 3) and my baby LOVES them!!!! THe bottles are cute (the gerber bottles would be fine, too, but they weren't cute enough!) He takes the nipple right away and finally the bottles are emptied in no time. What a relief. I am sure Avent is good for some babies, but not mine, even after months of "training". My advice is to try different bottles before settling on one kind. One more note, I read the other reviews that talk about leaking, I didn't have this problem at all. The only leaking was from my son's mouth when he couldn't latch on properly. But my cousin used Avent and they leaked terribly for her and she switched to Dr Browns. I would have tried Dr Browns but it looks like their bottles have the same nipples as Avent, too hard and not good for my baby. Expensive isn't always better!
I understand that some people might have a problem with this bottle type. If you screw the top on crooked at all or too tightly - you may have issues. But if you take a second and make sure that you are screwing on the top properly - you might have a leaking bottle once every 30 or 40 tries. I have used 4 of the other top brands and am very pleased with Avent. The Brownies are really good too - but just too hard to clean on a regular basis. If you only use a bottle once in a while - use browns - but if you use them a lot - get Avent. Only way to go.
I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them. I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line. After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him..... I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands
Unlike a couple of reviews I read, the only times I've had problems with the Avent bottles leaking is when I screwed the cap on badly or had the nipple in wrong.  Otherwise, they are perfect.  We were told that there may be &quot;nipple confusion&quot; if a baby goes from back and forth from breast to bottle but we haven't had a problem whatsoever.  These nipples are enough like the breast that he does just fine.  (His mouth is open wider than other bottles because he puts the whole nipple in his mouth, like the breast.)  I also use (and love) the Avent breast pump so you can pump right into the bottle and attach a nipple.  It couldn't be easier.
I have had these bottles with my now 2 1/2 year old and his now 4 month old little brother. They work great and are very durable. These have been dropped, sterelized, boiled, thrown, kicked, bitten, EVERYTHING and they still hold up! If you use the bottle correctly there are no leaks and it is very simple. They also work wiht the Avent Isis Breast Pump. My sons will only take to the "natural" nipple, and avents got it! The flow is not too fast, nor is it too hard to get it to come out! The available covers work nicely for carrying them and making sure the nipple is sanitary. The wide-neck allows for easy cleaning too, I never spend more than 2 minutes scrubing a bottle. They also are great for the "Magic Cups", those are sippy cups with a soft spout that are no-spill, (made by Avent), my 2 1/2 year old uses them and I dont have to buy a whole set of sippy cups because that top fits on any avent product! These bottles also fit very well in almost any cup holder (unlike the playtex) and greatly reduce my little ones gassy problems. I love these bottles, and the ventair is second, but a VERY far second, Avent is deffinatly much much better and actually do what they say they do, REDUCE GAS! What a lifesaver
When my daughter was born we stocked up on these bottles because we heard they were good and the price alone would make you think that. Well after using them for about 2 weeks they started to leak. NOT fun at 3:00 in the morning when you shake up a bottle and there is milk fling around.Even worse is when you are feeding and the milk pours out on baby's face. Not only do you have to clean up but your baby doesn't want to wait for a new bottle. After slowly running out of bottles that didn't leak we decided to go with the Playtex Nursers and liners.These work perfect! They don't leak and our baby has less gas. The liners prevent a lot of gas. If you are worried about the cost of liners Target has their own brand that is about half the price. You get 100 of them for maybe $5.00. We haven't had any problems with leaking at all.So I don't recommend the Avent bottles unless you want to be cleaning up milk all the time. But the other Avent things we have like the sterilizer, warmer, & many other products work just perfectly and would recommend all of them! So if you want to give these bottles a try because they do get some great reviews then just buy a few at first.We had no luck with the avent bottles but that doesn't mean they are all bad. I just had to give a warning so you don't lose a lot of money like we did.
I used these bottles with my son and loved them!This bottle system was excellent and my son almost never had any gas with them like he did with some others I tried out.  He took right to them as a newborn and I didn't have to encourage him like I had to with others.The wide mouth is so nice and makes them so much easier to wash.  The nipples and bottles are extremely durable and held up for a very long time.  As my son got older, I had other bottles I would use for him, but he always preferred the Avent ones.I never had problems with leaking like I had read about, so I don't know much about that.  But there was absolutely no leaking here!There is a great range of accessories that go with this bottle as well, including sterilizers and breast pumps.  Everything was compatible with my Avent breast pump and it made it a dream to use.I am pregnant with my second and Avent is all I am going to buy for her.
I love these bottles.  My Amelia is hardly every gassy with them.  As for the leaking issue, it is Not the bottle, it's the user!Bottle use de-mystified: you MUST  make sure that the top of the bottle and its threads are DRY and the flange of the nipple on the inside is dry as well.....then when you tightly screw on the cap it should make a soft squeak sound that perfects the seal. If either are wet or have milk on them (like when you open it to re-fill a partially full bottle) you must re-dry the threads and nipple before screwing closed. Motto: "IF you don't hear a squeak, it's gonna leak".  Good luck.
We got these bottles because they are supposed to be the closest thing to breast feeding, and they advertise a 'slow-flow' nipple.  Needless to say, the milk just ran down our baby's chin every time.  The slow-flow is not slow enough for a baby who is accustomed to breast feeding and having to work at gettimg milk out.  They are way too expensive and didn't work well for us.
I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck.  I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow.  You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer!Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle.  So, if you've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste!  The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find!  Good Luck!
Avent bottles are one of the best out there. Handy and easy to clean. They protect your baby from getting gas while he eats. But if your baby is really gasy and has colic, I recomend you the Dr brown bottles. I suggest you buy or register for both (avent and dr brown)so if your baby does ok with gas and colic you use avent, and if not, you use dr brown (at least for a while). You will notice the difference in a few weeks. But I most tell you avent work very well with gasy babies, so if you dont want to invest too much  money in bottles, avent will do great.
We think these bottles are very durable and easy to use. The markings didn't come off in the dishwasher, even after repeated washings. Also, Avent makes a long-spouted sippy top that fits on these bottles. Using this helps switch from bottle to cup.
I bought these after trying the Dr. Brown's system (don't waste your money there.) I love Avent bottles and so does my daughter. Easy to assemble, wash and use. My daughter likes the easy to latch on nipple and I like being able to purchase faster flow nipples as needed. Good quality bottles, don't leak and have easy to read oz./ml. measurements.
I was told that Avent bottles were the bottles to get and they were the only ones I ever gave to my son.  I was very pleased with them right off, so I never bothered to try any others.  He took the nipple right away and did not have any nipple confusion during the time I was both nursing and giving him a bottle.  I have not had any problems with leaking.  If the nipple is screwed on correctly, not a drop comes out while I shake it to mix up milk or formula.  The wide mouth makes the bottles very easy to clean.  I just use a bottle brush with warm, soapy water, then put the bottle, nipple and ring in my Avent steam sterilizer (which I love).  I have been using the bottles for seven months now and they are still in great shape.I have a friend who said her baby would not take the Avent nipples.  Since Avent bottles are not universal and can't be used with other brands of nipples and rings, you may want to keep this in mind before you spend much money on a lot of them.I think that most babies start eating more than 4 ounces during their second month, so you probably won't need many of this size.  I had seven bottles and that was the perfect amount for us.  Although my son uses the 9 ounce bottles now, I still use some of the 4 ounce bottles to mix and store formula that I add to his cereal.
I bought this pump mainly because were always out and about.  I am actually a stay at home mom but this came in handy in MANY ways.  When my daughter was first born she was re-admitted to the hospital at 3 days for jaundice.  I had read that breat milk can increase or worsen jaundice so I pumped to save the milk for when she got out of the hospital.  The ice packs were definatly a plus and so was the cooler bag.  I had frozen just the bag to keep it cooler along with the ice packs and that really helped keep it colder longer.  The bottles that comes with it are ok.  I don't recommend Avent bottles for feeding but for storage they're perfect.  But if you prefer Avent you can just pop a nipple on the bottle and wha-la, ready to feed.  These bottles can go from pump, to fridge/freezer, to warmer, to bottle with not problem.As for the pump, once you get used to assembling it its a breeze.  It's also VERY comfortable to use with or without the &quot;petals&quot;.  I NEVER had a problem with not pumping (or producing) enough milk.  This also came in handy and quickly reduced engorgement for me.  All I had to do was pump for about 5  min on each side and it was instant relief and baby latched on better.I highly recommend this pump for everyone.  It's comfortable, efficient, whisper quiet, and easy to clean and put together.  A must have.
My daughter was in the NICU the first day of her life, and then the special care nursery the next few days, so I had to use the hospitals electric medela dual breast pump to express milk. i returned home and rented the medela for a month and hated it. It HURTS my nipples. My friend got me this Isis breast pump kit and I tried it. I LOVE it! I used it since my daughter was about 2 weeks old. I doesnt hurt my nipples like the electric breast pump does as I can control it with every squeeze. It doesnt hurt my wrist (as one might think.) I only supplement my daughter with one bottle of EBM at night. It takes me 10-15 minutes and I can express 5 ounces with this pump! I LOVE IT!Oh, and it is virtually silent so I can pump one breast as I breast feed my daughter on the other!!!
It's a great manual pump, but it's just a manual pump after all. Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk. It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day. However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies (like the time I forgot my other pump at home) or for out-of-office meetings (because it's small and discrete). It's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job.
I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got.  However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day!! Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous. If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping.  On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours.
I am a first time mother and a stay at home mom. Since I am not working I wanted a hand pump rather than electric for occasional night out so I got Isis. The first time I used it (1 week after giving birth), it took me 45 minutes to pump 1 1/2 oz! I thought it to be terrible! So I bought a Madela electric.But as months passed I got a little bit more experienced in breast feeding, I realized that if I knew how stimulate a "let down" that the Isis would have worked for me. It took me 45 minutes the first time I used Isis because I never had a let down. Unlike Madela which simulate a baby's sucking which then stimulated a "let down", with Isis it is up to me to get myself to "let down".Isis would work great for any mother if: 1-you pump while your baby is breastfeeding on the other breast or 2-if you know how to stimulate your breast enough to stimulate a "let down".My Isis did squeak when I used it, so beware if you plan on pumping with this in public if this sort of thing embarasses you.
I love the Advent line & highly recommend their bottles & microwave sterilizer, but this breast pump is awful! The prong that connects to the handle, which creates the vacuum to pull the milk out, consistently becomes unlatched breaking the vacuum so you have to fix it and start all over. The only reason it got a two stars rating was because the pump handle does fit extremely well on the bottles and everything fits in the bag nicely.
I bought this pump after seeing the success a coworker had with the ISIS pump. I'm back to work full time and it has been working very well for me. I started pumping at about 3 weeks, and was very fustrated at first. It was tricky to figure out the timing and how much suction to use to get a good let down and milk flow. After a few calls to the Avent customer service line (who were wonderful, very helpful and patient), I was getting much better results. By the time I went back to work I had a very nice supply of milk in the freezer and was comfortable pumping at work.Why I like it - 1) it's discrete, you can pump anywhere without the noise of an electic pump and the black case looks like any other professional bag a woman would carry 2) it's portable, It's small and light to carry around - even with a few bottles of milk. 3) it's easy - not only to pump with but assembly and cleaning are a breeze. I know a few reviews state that there are too many parts and it's hard to put together, but I can do it in 15 seconds flat  4) it's comfortable - I think any breastpump may be awkward to use at first, but compared to an electric pump I tried my nipples and breasts were much more comfortable with the ISIS pumpI think for the price, you can't beat it. Also the realm of accessories available is impressive. Avent has thought of every possible need you may have.
Although I haven't been using this pump for very long, I've been able to get very good results. Of course, pumping takes practice but this pump works great for beginners. It is very easy to set up and clean...making it easy to take along. I also like that the bottles fit onto the pump-nothing extra to buy (and clean). I also have an electric pump but prefer this pump when I am home during the day. I find that I can more quickly get it ready and am able to pump one side as soon as my baby is finished nursing on the other side. I definitely recommend having a manual pump, even if you plan on or already have an electric.
I borrowed this breast pump from my sister and it is awesome!  This is my third child and I have breastfeed all three.  I have tried them all and this one is great.  The one-hand squeeze handle allows me to do other things while pumping!  I am only expressing twice a day so it is easy to clean!  What a great investment.
I used this product briefly and found it to be great for the price.  I used the electric Medella pump in the hospital and found this pump to be very comparable.  I actually think the Isis may have been more comfortable.  I would recommend to anyone who is considering breast feeding.
After trying a dual electric pump that was very uncomfortable for me I tried the Isis berast pump and never looked back. I could not control the suction with the electric pump and,  however with the Isis I was able to control the pressure and was able to completely empty both breasts in less than 20 minutes total. The cushioning made the pump very comfortable. And my hand never got tired from manually pumping. I used this product years ago with my daughter and I am adding it to my registry for my second child. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to continue breast feeding.Follow-up: My youngest daughter is now six weeks old and I still love this pump. Its a moust-have for breastfeeding mothers.
I received this as a shower gift and boy am I thankful! After I returned from the hospital and my milk came in, boy was I engorged!! I hadn't expected to have to use this until I actually went back to work, but I was hurtin bad and was so greatful I had this already. I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have one yet-probably exploded!I went back to work as my son turned 2 months old. I wanted to continue breastfeeding, and this has helped me do just that. I work in a small office with nothing but a handful of men...with one bathroom! So I didn't want an electric one where everyone could hear an odd humming sound coming from the closed door. With this one, I can discreetly pump in the bathroom for about 10 minutes. It expresses the milk pretty fast in my opinion and it doesn't really hurt. Maybe because my nipples are toughened up now. It's great to store the milk in if you need to or for the ride home. It keeps it at a good temperature until you can get to a refridgerator again (I don't use the cold packs).All in all, this is a great breast pump set in every way.Something else that is great is that I own the Avent Microwave Steam Sterilizer and it has slots especially for the Avent pump to click into-and Avent bottles. It only takes 4 minutes in the microwave to have everything sterilized. Awesome all the way around!
I love my Isis. A friend bought it to me as a gift and I use it everyday. First it was a little hard, but it was only because my milk wasn't coming out at all. But after my production started, the pump started to work perfectly. Highly recommended :)
This pump is comfortable, easy to use, and affordable.  I wish I could find replacement parts more easily - my only complaint.
I have been using this twice a day since going back to work almost four months ago. With it I can express milk discreetly and quickly. I can get between 7 and 10 ounces in 10 minutes. I have never used an electric pump so I can't compare but if you are looking for a manual pump this one is perfect.
I was looking for a small drying rack for Sigg water bottles and this is perfect. It has two different sized adjustable arms so that you can arrange it to suit your needs. Also, not pictured, is a little attachment for tops and lids.
Using it for all the baby items - pacifiers, nipples, etc... Holds the items well, easy to put them on. Wish it could fold up and fit in the cupboard when we aren't using it, then would give it 5 stars.
I wanted a small rack to dry my granddaughters bottles and accessories - and this works nicely.  Holds the right amount, drains right into the sink and also has a small hook on tray for drying items that won't fit on one of the &#34;stems&#34;.  Just what I wanted.
This a necessary item. I hated to have to cover my coffee table and have my house look baby proof(I even avoided it for a while) but after two big bumps i bought this item.Its easy to install and I like that I could cut it to the size i needed. It came with the corners which is great. The tape it uses is perfect because it really stays put. My baby has tried to pull at it and it doesn't come off.This color is light enough that doesn't call too much attention in my living room.
These edge guards come in handy in a number of places. They stick very well, even on uneven surfaces.  They are easy to cut and to mount exactly where needed.  The variety of colors is also nice to try and match various types of furniture or hazards.  I've deployed them in some areas for my own protection too ... I've stubbed my toe one too many times on my bed leg in the dark heading to change a diaper ... put a piece on each corner, and saved several swear words as a result!They've saved the day in several spaces:- Fireplace hearth (even on uneven red brick they stick well)- Underside of dining room table edges and corners- Edges of dressers and furniture- Edges of bedpostThey include 3M adhesive that sticks very well. My only complaint is that they provide the adhesive in strips rather than a roll. So you have to pull of many pieces and join them together on a long strip.  For best grip you need to put it on each side of the inside &#34;L&#34; of the protectors. A roll would be much faster to apply.
So easy to install too!  I did the corners first so it was easier.  You have enough tape for every square inch.
This item, it is so good. it protected my 10 month old son from many bruises.  Baby crawls without looking what is ahead, he hit the coffee table edge mostly, but I have this on the edge... It is very helpful to have it on the sharp edges.  I wanted to tape all the corner of my house.
i reviewed similar product from this company before. it is a good product which can absorb force well so all in all it serves it purpose well.One thing it can improve on is the adhesive glue used for bonding. Currently it uses 3M tapes, which is okay but over time a child's curiosity will grow they will pick on it and over a period of two months of picking it may come off. But they give you plenty of 3M tapes, so you can put it together again.
With an adventurous and slightly clumsy baby, these have gone a long way towards avoiding bruises and bumps while she learns to walk and run. The ability to cut the padding and included double sided sticking tape with scissors make it easy to pad sharp furniture edges of all lengths. However there are a couple of things we have found that help us optimize its usage.  We learned to make sure the ends of any piece were very well stuck down and didn't jut out otherwise our baby would pick at them and start peeling off the padding - to avoid this, it helped to put double-sided tape all the way to the end of the piece on both inner edges.  Also we didn't use the precut edges because we found that our baby managed to rip them off pretty easily and then tried to eat the backing tape.Just be aware that if your baby is teething, the spongy texture of the padding makes it tempting for them to bite on.  I'm not 100% comfortable with that as it is fire retardant-treated despite being labeled non-latex and non-toxic.  For now I just wipe them down several times with hot water and dry well or try to put other more tempting teethers within reach.
The instructions that came with this are terrible. The diagrams are really tiny and have no labels. The written instructions for Step 1 say "see the diagram" and do not elaborate, making the instructions worthless. The 3M sticky tape is REALLY sticky. Do not expect to get it off your furniture or to reuse these edge guards - the tape will cling to your furniture and to the guards, destroying both.In the end I was unable to install my guards properly - they attached to the furniture crookedly and then I couldn't un-stick them in order to make it right. The guards are nice, thick foam, but that doesn't matter if the installation goes miserably.You can see my photos of the final results I got in the Customer Image Gallery.
This is pretty simple to put in place and not too much of an eyesore as childproofing goes. I'd recommend it.
I gave it only four stars because the item arrived with some of it missing,that was however resolved.The product does what it is supposed to.
I bought thisPrince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Greyin hope of protecting my son from bumps on our coffee table. Well i procrastinated and didn't put it up till this week. My son is 10 months and is full blown running so it was time. problem was i could not find the adhesive to attach the thing to the table. So i improvised. We measured the foam and cut accordingly to make it a tight fit. we then attached the corner pieces to the cut out parts using gorilla glue and then clear packing tape to re-enforece the hold. finally we put it on the table, it has just enough give to put on and off but not enough that LO will pull it off easily and huge plus for us...no damage to our pottery barn table! once i get so me photos i will attach but for the moment it is serving its purpose and we are very happy! another plus we had about 6 inches left over that we used to cover our desk pull out keyboard thing. can't beat that.
Great Idea and has helped out alot as our son seems to always be bumping his head on stuff in the near vicinity of him. However the glue on this device could be a little stronger because soon after applying it to what ever you need it on, our son figured out how to pull it off and now it won't stay on!
I just put this up yesterday and was glad I did. My daughter been using the coffee table to pull her self up to stand and also been crawling through it to play with the stuff underneath. Just right after I put it on she was doing that! She even bumped her head on the edge! Thank god this was on so she was fine!Not sure how it would work on a walking/running baby into corners/edges. But this seem to be doing well. It's nice and thick.The tape that came with it isn't that sticky though. It makes it easy to stick and restick back on so you get it on good. But at the same time, I fear my daughter would figure out that she can pull it off.I'll see how that goes but so far I'm content with this.Cutting the roll itself seems a bit annoying. because I can't seem to get a STRAIGHT edge using a scissor.
I think my daughter would pull off any table corner I put on, but this one at least seems the most sturdy and is easy to put back on when she does pull it off. The chocolate is the closest color we could get to our espresso tables, nothing is going to look great, but this at least looks decent and clean.
This a great product. Also it would be good if you could buy plastic cover for the top of the crib railling.
People seem to have unrealistic expectations of products sometimes. They want it to stick like crazy YET not hurt their furniture. There is a balance there that you have to have. You can't have everything. I bought this to try to cover some of the worst corners. You can't cover everything, but we have to make an effort since our 10 month old is scooting around now. He hasn't paid any attention to the padding nor tried to pull it off YET. And we haven't had to remove any to see if it hurts our furniture. It doesn't make the furniture look great by any means, but it is what it is. I care more about the safety than the aesthetics of my furniture. The padding should be sufficient to stop minor bumps and bruises. I'm satisfied for the moment...I'll update if that changes.I deducted a star because I ordered beige and got chocolate...not worth the hassle to return it. On a second order, we did get the beige but it is darker than they make it look in the photo. Neither was a HUGE deal to us, but I could see this mattering to people wanting to match their furniture more.
I needed a solution for a sharp tile step down into my living room- every time I stepped down I envisioned my baby cracking her skull on that :( I was hesitant to buy this, though,  because I was skeptical that it would stick and chocolate seemed like the wrong color to match my tile. It sticks really well- we'll see how it holds up over time- and the color looks great against my taupe tile. It really doesn't look cheesy at all. We're going to use the corner pieces on a table of mine and I've already checked the color there too. Not great against some sort of reddish brown wood, but miles ahead of the hideous Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper. This stuff gives a perfect fit since it's cut to fit. The expandable thing doesn't fit the sizes listed (no way it will work on a 90 inch table) and it looks like a pair of hand-me-down training pants from the 1970s.
Sticks amazingly well and cushions nicely. The straight pieces can easily be made into corner pieces, since four corners go quickly.
This took care of our immediate need - PROTECT THE BABY'S HEAD.  :)  This was easy to put around our oblong coffee table and didn't leave too bad of a sticky mess when we needed to remove it.  I'm not sure if he ever really hit his head on the table but if he did, we either missed it or it didn't hurt - thanks to the bumper!
I purchased this for the breakfast nook around my marbel countertop.  Since I don't have kids yet (we are adopting) I can't really comment about the durability.  However, they seemed to stay on tight when I applied the tape to the top and bottom on the inside of the foam.  If not I will do what some of the other posters suggested.It wasn't difficult to cut the foam to length.  I just started with one corner edge, measured the long foam piece, and then cut the foam with scissors (just alittle bit longer then what I though I needed.  It cut slightly jagged, but since I cut on the long side adjusting it wasn't a problem.  The finish product doesn't look funny or leave any gaps at all.
We put this on our coffee table six months ago, all but one of the corners have fallen off repeatedly. The long strips dont really protect my child much. She will still bump into the table at times and it doesnt offer much cushion. It is not really thick enough or wide enough. Corners are a joke. The tape provided is not sticky enough. Just keeps coming off.
Love the ease of use, color, and cushions very well for my clumsy baby.  I have it guarding edges of my glass TV stand and it works great!
We bought 2 sets, used on window sill, formica edges and corners, and along mirrored wall edges... we suggest not putting tape in guard but putting on the surface first, then slowly rolling the guard over the tape in a straight line.
We used these with my first daughter and bought them again for the 2nd. They stick well and are very helpful with the sharp corners. Use more sticky stuff than you think you need.  Also, after a year on my entertainment center, I was able to take everything off with a little elbow grease!
We were able to cover the edge at Grandma's house with ease.  Cuts easy, tape is sticky and hasn't peeled off.  My daughter has tried to peel off a part, and we just stuck it back on and it's still sticking and working just fine.
The table was a little larger but cutting it to leave a 1" space in the center of each length works great.  The triplets climb all over the living and always come back to the table to play.  It looks good and you don't even notice its there.
so glad we put these on when we did. My 11 mo old daughter has bumped her head many-a-time since we put these on our tables and shelves about 3 months ago, and has not been hurt once. They are still sticking strong too.
These were easy to install and are aesthetically bearable. We'll see how easily my 8-month old will pull them off, but so far they are holding even though we've had some climbing onto them and such. I do wish that it came with a LOT more tape so that when it does come off I can just put it back on.
Good idea but this is very cheaply made... it is not sticky enough to stay on anything... my 6 month old baby would just yank it off immediately. I wish I never purchased this because you'd basically have to crazy glue to your furniture and there's no way I am doing that!
I used this table edge and corner guard to edge a window in my son's playroom. The window was level with the daybed he often played on, and I had visions of him cracking his head. I lined the edges of the windowsill. This works well. My son is a pretty good listener, and I kept telling him not to touch or pull the foam off, it was there for a reason, and it is still there two months later. It will come off very easily if pulled, just a forewarning. But I like this product and would use it again.
I bought a Safety First Foam Edge Bumper from Wal-Mart for the SAME price as this that was only about 5ft and didn't have corners, and it was already cut into strips. That was a HUGE mistake. Comparing this set to the one I bought, it wins in every category. It contains more than twice as much foam - PLUS corners, you can cut it to whatever size you need, it bends around curves, and It's MUCH softer than the Safety First bumper!I love it, and it's perfect. It STICKS! It's 3m brand double-sided tape and it didn't budge! I suspect people who said it doesn't stick did not clean/dry the surface properly, touched the tape too much, or maybe had a textured surface. I couldn't pull mine off, so I know my 9 month old can't.
I put this on my coffee table and it works great. Seems pretty secure and there will be no split foreheads with this stuff on the edges!
Easy to put up, takes a bit of time, but overall fairly easy!  Wasn't too crazy about the type of adhesive that comes with it, but I look at it this way.... I'd rather re-finish my wood coffee tabble than deal with all the boo-boos and broken teeth it(my coffee table) has caused! (I have three kiddos and this coffee table has taken a tooth from two of them before they were 2yrs old)  I'm hoping this protector will prevent that with my third little one! Personally I hate this coffee table, but my husband will not get rid of it... I put this protector on my fire place too, and it looks and feels wonderful.  I like that it streches a bit, and I had plenty of adhesive left over! I rate this product 4 stars, definitely worth the price just know that adhesive is going to be a consern when I remove the product!
This stuff works great for baby proofing. Have had it on our coffee tables and other sharp edges for over a year. Still in place and working. Has saved my son from some nasty bumps and bruises many times. Totally worth it. Wish it came in black.
Great product! The foam is thick and durable! It has stayed in place for the most part. The corner pieces tend to easily come off with a little one around. I would still recommend!
Bought this item to line the corners of the coffee table, side tables, and fire place. It has worked out nicely and did not have any problem w/ the double sided sticky. You can customize the padding by cutting them.
Works great.  Takes some time to put the adhesive strips on, but these work so much better than other brands we have tried.  Also, they are soft enough to prevent bruises when they do fall into them.
These work for small corner surfaces. If you have a large surface to cover, like a table corner, make sure that you cut the strip in half. If you put it on as one long strip it will fall off.  Works good for coffee tables.
Good quality product.  Lots of cusion and sticks well.  We had a hard time getting it to stick to our fireplace because it has wood around the brick hearth and the corners aren't flat.  But we used it for other things in our house and my son can't just peel it off like other products.  Thank you!
This product does not adhere well.  I have tried it on wood, metal, and painted surfaces.  What's more, other "safety" products I have purchased that use well-known 3M tape were defective as well. Also, when I tried to remove the cushion, the tape removed my furniture paint.  Overall, I rate this item with 2 stars because the neutral color does not attract my toddler's attention and the cushion does prevent painful head bumps.
Quite simply this product does what it says.  I accidentally ordered 2 packs and in brown but I like it anyway.  Just gives me peace of mind to now that if my daughter should bump into a table corner the blow will be cusioned
I have tried tons of different bumpers and my favorite is prince lionheart, it is easy to apply and is nice looking as well.
These bumpers work well on our wooden coffee table. Our daughter has already hit her head on the edge and she was not injured at all. They're ugly, but I'm not sure how a bumper could be more attractive. They were easy enough to install and I found that the adhesive worked fine, although I have not tried to remove it yet.
This is the worst thing ever. It sticks for one week and then its down. I put in on my coffe table and end tables and they are all damage because of the tape.Don't buy it
This product works rather well.  It is easy to apply to furniture and it remains in place.  I highly recommend it.
This product comes with special double-sided sticky tape to attach the guards. It&#699;s easy to apply to the inside of the guards and easy to attach to the corners and surfaces that you want to use. For us we have an extremely sharp edge in our shower and baby crawls around so we didn&#699;t want him to slip and fall on the edge. We put the guard on the edge and it stays even though it gets wet every day as we shower. I used the table corners for the corners of low window sills that are in his play area and it works well to protect him from falling on them and doubles as a teether. lol He loves chewing on it! It&#699;s a very soft, spongy material. Hopefully there&#699;s no BPA in it because it&#699;s constantly in my son&#699;s mouth!
This is a great product for protecting your babies! We loved its quality and baby proofed our entire living room with it!
We like the product and works very well. It's a little pricey but overall good product. We have purchased several.
I wish I had two! One to use, while the other is washing! It seems as soon as I take off my baby's diaper, it's then she decides to "go".I read other reviews about complaints of color fading and shrinkage. Well, I have had NO color fading and the shrinkage has been minimal, and certainly not to the degree others had mentioned. I have washed the cover over and over on hot and then let it air dry instead of putting it in the dryer. Maybe that's why I havent had so much of a shrinkage problem. Regardless, it fits the contoured pad fine still, a bit snugger but not at all too small.I would have given it 5 stars if the terrycloth they used had been a higher quality. I mean really, for the price, I could have bought a better made towel that had emblishments that cost more than the cheap elastic they used to make the cover. I would have even paid more to have the choice between this terrycloth and a better one.Finally, I still am very pleased and would purchase it with the contoured changing pad for a friend's baby shower too!
After only a few uses and washes, this pad cover started to tear.  It was ripping in the corners, and no matter how gentle I was, the hole got bigger.The color choice is out standing. . .however I just wish that it had held up a bit better for us.
I am so pleased that the Contoured Changing Table Pad has so many choices in color for its cover! I purchased the lilac, and a white cover and they both go well with my nursery decor. I only wish I got more that two!These terrycloth covers are thick, absorbant and easy on my newborn's skin. The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a little when you wash them. So, when you go to put them back on the pad the fit is a bit tight, but I find they pull out pretty quickly to thier normal size. When they do finally get to small to fit the pad I will go out and buy some more! I mean it's terrycloth, what do ya expect? Besides, the darn things get all kinds of yuck on them all day. They are going to take a beating being washed all the time as it is. They are totally worth the money to replace! I would buy them again!
Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief!  Didn't even use it once!  Don't bother!!!
I connected two different brands, a double jeep and single (? brand) which are two different heights. It was slightly difficult especially since the double didn't have much room to put the middle connector on.. but it works! It's not like a SMOOTH push or anything (but it is smooth with same size/brand ones, I have another same brand single lol), but it's worth it! Love!
After tiring of wiping up trays that didn't stay put, straps that couldn't be cleaned completely and levers that didn't operate easily, we tossed our high chair and booster seats for this absolutely WONDERFUL little seat.  Made of an interesting foamy material, it actually stays where you put it on a chair so your little one can eat like a "big person" at the table with you.  The surface wipes clean easily, it's portable and comes in its own plastic carry case so you can toss it in the car to bring along to restaurants (who wants to use a filthy universal high chair that maybe 1000+ kids have spilled on before yours??)Your child will love the comfy feel, the secure bottom and the colors!  We bought ours in the store and there was a choice of Aqua, Red, Black, Royal Blue and Purple.  The price is right in line with other toddler feeding contraptions, and this one will grow with your child till they are old enough to sit without a booster.  There are no straps on this seat, however, so don't expect to prop a baby inside...your child must be at least 18 months old OR old enough to sit still while eating and not topple out.
This is the best booster seat. It "grips" easily to chairs and does not slide. We use it in our captains chairs and our son is great in it! It is the most durable seat too. My nephew has had one for two years or more now and it is still in EXCELLENT condition. It is soft and comfy. It may seem pricey for a booster but it is definitely worth it. It travels easy and wipes clean in a heartbeat. Grandma even bought one to keep at her house for all the kids! Definitely a must have!
For the older toddler, this booster seat is more comfortable and spacious than the hard plastic booster seats with trays.  The hard plastic seats slide around on wood chairs and never feel stable, even when strapped around the chair.  The trays don't leave enough room for a bigger child's legs.  However, this booster seats is soft and cushiony.  It feels stable on wood chairs, and it allows the child to sit at the big people's table.  Obviously, it's not as good for the young infant or younger toddler who needs a tray to contain the mess, but it's definitely better for the older toddler who knows how to eat neatly off a plate or bowl.  The older toddler hopefully is also well-trained enough to know not to jump around in the seat because it's not attached to the adult chair.
This is a great product.  They do what they are supposed to do, at least on my desk.  My desktop/corners consist of a wood laminate, with a very smooth surface, so these things stick very well.  However, I have not attempted to take them off yet, and i'm sure a little 'Goo-Gone' or rubbing alcohol will do the trick when the time comes.  I will be dissapointed if they harm some of the finish, but then again you can't put a price on protecting your precious child from severe injury, which can easily occur when their head hits a table or desk corner!  For this 'peace of mind', I give this product 5 stars.  One more thing... there is NO substitute for proper and constant child supervision.
I love these. I haven't had to take them off the table so I can't speak to the residue part, but these are snug and protective.
These don't stick at all! My guys ripped them off the sides of the tables the second we put them up. The adhesive wouldn't restick either. What a waste. :(
I just put these on some sharp corners in my house and they are great.  The tape is sticking well so far and they have already protected my son's head.  He moves so fast right to where the furniture is. I watch him and move him away, but it makes me feel better to have these there just in case.  I needed the jumbo size for the bottom of my entertainment center.
I ordered these corner guards for my TV stand and coffee table and they work great, the only down fall is if your furniture isn't as thick as the guard the sides don't stick very well because they aren't flat against a surface like they are on the top.
it never worked, i cleaned the surface and followed direction...failed.tried with double sided tape... failed.tried with regular tape.... failed.i think the problem is that it's not smooth again the surface on top, so it creates a little gap and easily falls off.
We love this product.  Being able to change the music our son listens to every nite is such a nice option - and we don't have to listen to the same lullaby's all the time (if at all).The light is dim, but as a few others noted, who wants a bright light?  The baby is trying to sleep!It's enough light to see him if I peek in and it's still on.I feel the volume is plenty loud enough.  It is a crib cd player, not a house cd player.  It's plenty loud enough for his tiny nursery, and i've never turned it all the way up.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the battery issue - it eats batteries worse than any other toy he has - including the swing which we use much more often.I thought that was strange, and if it does take that much power, it should come with rechargable batteries.Maybe the next model :)overall we're very pleased though.
could not even try it it didn't fit on our crib. looks like a good idea.
I love my cd player. My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep...at night and for naps. I like it cause it shuts off itself. I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder,...but it truly is worth buying!
I thought this would be a great idea. So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them. We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit. I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back. When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped. We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time.
We have two of these and love them.  I tried to use the little potty that sits on the floor but I prefer this one.  It is much less messy.  We have a boy and the front of the seat is high so it keeps the pee in the toilet for the most part. Would highly recommend this!
After some little potty chair fails, I decided to try out a seat that fits on the big toilet. This one came up first as it has the most reviews, and it does for a reason. This seat works, period. I do have a girl though so I cant vouch if it works for the little guys.It has a device underneath that tightens it onto the big toilet seat. My toilet seat is the flat plastic kind so it went on with little problem. I have to finagle it a little, but it fits and is very secure so thats a win in my book.SIDE NOTE: Grandma owns the Fischer Price froggy potty which works perfectly, so if you are also thinking about getting a little chair, I highly recommend it.
I definitely, wholeheartedly recommend the Baby Bjorn toilet seat reducer.This seat is contoured in a way that makes it comfortable to sit on and boy's pee goes into the toilet.There is a kind-of dial thing at the back that you turn to make the seat fit snugly and securely onto your toilet so it does not shift when your little one is on it.The handle at the back means you can hang it on a little hook if you wanted to stick one of those removable 3M hooks to your wall.I also give bonus points for the colour- white without a licensed TV character in sight :-)
My son is 21 months old and likes the bear on the product, which entices him to sit down on it. There is no risk of him falling in, and it doesn't seem to slip.
I bought BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer to potty train my son.  He likes using it, and the splash guard in the front works.  There is an adjustment wheel located at the back of the seat by the handle to adjust the Toile Trainer to the size of the regular toilet seat.  We have elongated Kohler toilets and the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer adjust to fit snugly.The reason I am rating it 4 stars is the adjustment wheel started slipping after a few removal and reinstallations.  Now if I have to reinstall the seat, I pre-adjust it and then position it onto the regular toilet seat.
We bought this about 8 months before my daughter started seriously training. Once she started training this was a great seat and she used it until about six months after she was trained and could get up on the seat on her own. Great seat.
I just got done potty training my boy/girl twins using the small potty chairs that sit on the floor but we are planning a vacation in a few weeks and they were terrified of using the big potty but we really had to get them using one.  I bought a cheap-o potty seat and it slid around all over the place and they were scared to use it so we went back and paid twice as much and got the Bjorn and so glad we did.  We have a TOTO brand toilet and the seat is very deep and contoured so the lock on the Bjorn didn't work at all on our toilet seat, but because it also has a grippy bottom and is quite large, it fits great anyway.  My toddlers were fine using it and began using the big potty the same day we bought it.  Definately worth the extra money, great design!
the best!  we have 4, all over the house...
Good toddler toilet seat.  No issues.  Fits well on long toilet seat.  It does come up a little easier then I thought but still no issues.
This is a fantastic seat for these reasons:1. Doesn't slide or wiggle on the toilet.2. Easy to clean!3. Pretty flat, light-weight compact design can pack easily in a suit case or other luggage for travel.4. Doesn't pinch skin.5. Child doesn't fall through hole (holds little behinds securely).6. Easily removeable for adult use of toilet.7. Carrying handle is great for kids and sanitary for moving the seat around.The only reason I did not give this seat 5 stars is if a little boy is sitting to go #1, you really have to make sure his "aim" is down otherwise as the force of urine stream hits the deflector it can splash up onto his legs a bit (nothing a bit of TP can't hande, though). If the deflector were a tad higher this problem probably would go away. The other issue is that if his "aim" isn't directed either right in the center of the deflector or right down into the bowl, the urine can splatter up under the deflector and make its way onto the toilet seat, toilet rim, and/or the back of the kid's pants if the clothing is not pushed down beyond the gap between the toilet seat and rim.No problems with #2.Don't forsee any trouble with little girl use either (daughter will use this seat in about 1 1/2 years).Despite the deflector issue - I would buy this product again there are too many other great attributes of it. All it means is a little extra foresight for mom and dad when he is getting ready to go.
This item is very simple to install and the white plastic makes it very easy to clean.  My son (22 months) has no problem sitting on it.  The shield for boys is not high enough to sit him close to the front but if I move him to the rear of the seat the stream doesn't go over the shield.  Great design, if it wasn't so pricey I would get rid of my portable potties and purchase 2 more of these.
My daughter was scared of falling in the toilet when she first started potty training.  She was so scared that she would wait until the very last second to go and she would have accidents because of it.  With this training seat she fit perfectly and her fear was over.  We ended up purchasing 3 of these because they worked so well.I am only giving it four starts though because we did find that she would hurt her booty and &#34;parts&#34; some times when she would try to slide up on it.  I understand why the bump in the front is there (to stop kids from peeing out the front of it) but if it could be made with a softer material (at least on the front) it might make it easier and less painful for kids to get on and off of.
I think you have to like this toilet trainer.  It's comfortable, reliable and easy to clean.  This is a better model than many alternatives.
It fits! Finally a sturdy potty seat for my awkward toilet. Potty training has been much easier now that my wiggly boy can sit without sliding off.
Happily we are way past the training. I forgot to review earlier, but this is a very good choice and no pinching or hang ups for my Grandson. I do recommend this one but you also will have to train him to hold himself down so the flow doesn't jump the small cup. He caught on right away so no problems there. Last but not least, the cleaning was easy, fast and comfortable from the first time on without fear of falling in because it's a perfect size.
I have 3 boys and this is the solution for our needs. I like it is made of hard plastic instead of the foam type seat, easy to clean. It has a nice shape for sitting. As far as a boy doing number 1 while sitting on the potty, he has to lean forward or you will have a mess to clean up. That doesn't seem to be a big deal to the boys. It has a nice loop on the top so we can hang it on the toilet with the potty hook and it is adjustable to fit different potty hole sizes. Seems very durable. I have one in every bathroom.
This seat is awesome, it fits both elongated and normal bowls very snugly.  It does not slip and slide.  My 2 year old daughter can lift it up and put it on the toilet.  It is very easy to clean.  Great product.
I purchased this hoping to avoid using a stand alone toilet trainer.  This seat fits snugly onto the toilet and doesn't move around.  My daughter just didn't like sitting up on the adult toilet...Oh well, I know it will get used someday when she does feel more comfortable sitting up there.
Works well, but you basically need to also buy the steps that go with it or your kid cannot get on the potty by themselves.. which is the point.  To be honest we have the mini potty by baby bjorn and it is simpler and the kids can do it all on their own... so this might be good for someone to use in a second bathroom where they do not want to have a little potty sitting around. You can easily hide it behind the toilet...
At first, I wasn't sure if this seat would work as it doesn't have side handles and the splash guard seemed too high. However, after three months of regular use, my 2.5 year old son has no problems with it and it fits nice and snugly on our Toto toilets.
great seat, fits well on toilet, my son loves it. comfortable.  great quality.  we also have the baby bjorn potty, so they make great products.
Used this seat for my daughter, and now using it for my son. The guard is great as long as you teach your son how to sit properly on the seat. This has been a great seat for us, and it fits both of our toilets securely. No complaints from the kids either.
This potty seat is simple, comfortable and easy to use.  I have only found one toilet that it did not fit on.  Only potty seat we'll use for our kids.  We love it!  Seat is made in Sweden.
Which just about says it all!This potty seat is easy for my daughter to put on the potty and remove. We have a hook on the wall for hanging it when she's not using it. She seems to find it comfy to, judging from how long she's willing to sit there sometimes. And, best of all, it's relieved her totally valid fears of falling into the big potty, which means a lot less little potty clean-up for us.This is our 3rd potty seat. The other two had soft, foamy seats, which try as we might, we couldn't keep clean. We ended up tossing them, as they would eventually begin to smell, and become discolored from the inside out. They always seemed to leave my daughter's bum with an angry red rash too. So, the absolute best feature of this potty seat is how clean it is, how clean it stays, and how low maintenance it is. We wipe it down occasionally, but its wonderful design keeps it from getting waste on it, and keeps germs from accumulating.Lastly, it's easy to install for any toilet. We have one in both our bathrooms, and sent one to my daughter's preschool, so it fits large toilets as well.Despite the higher price, this is an item that will last a long time and function as expected. Ultimately, I believe that makes it worth the extra money.
It is so secure when placed on a toilet and really - that's what I was worried about.  It's very comfortable for my big/tall toddler and I feel very safe when she uses it.
All the potty seats I looked at say they are for older children, including this one. My daughter is almost a year old. I had started, earlier this summer, putting her on the regular potty when I noticed her struggling with a #2. So rather than watching her be uncomfortable as she sat in her diaper or stood on her hands and feet in awkward positions, I decided to take her to the potty. It was tiring and uncomfortable holding her on the regular toilet seat, but using the toilet was effective at helping my daughter do the job she needed to do, plus I've saved several diapers this way.After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Babybjorn Toilet Trainer. It is perfect! My daughter seems comfortable on it, and I don't have to use as much strength to support her on the toilet since the Babybjorn seat provides a better and more stable sitting surface without me having to worry about her little bottom sinking into the toilet.I have a very small bathroom and just recently purchased a Potty Hook from Babies R Us. Now the potty seat hangs from the toilet tank and is easily accessible and neat looking.Pros:Sits securely on toilet seatEasy to cleanFlexible handle for hangingCons:Expensive (best price at my time of purchase was here at Amazon)I would recommend it, but I am wondering if the Arm and Hammer seat (which seems to be similar in shape) is comparable. It is less expensive. I would like to get another seat for Grandma and Papa's home, but am not sure if I want to spend the same amount of money I spent on the Babybjorn seat since my daughter will be at my home more than at her grandparents' home.
This potty works just as described and has been very easy to use.  My only complaint is that for a little boy you do have to be sure to push his privates as downward as possible because the bump at the front is not that high.  Once I did not do this and had pee going everywhere.
I have a very large (and very precocious) 18 month boy who is doing GREAT with this! I just came back to order another one for upstairs after carrying one back and forth for 1.5 weeks. Super portable (but easier to have one on each floor!), I've already followed another reviewer's advice to pop it in a tote bag for when we're out and about- that way, he's not afraid of using the sometimes huge potties in stores! I can't compare this to any other seats (well, we also got an actual potty chair just in case, but he's not interested), but this has worked great so far. Very comfy, and no spraying or damaged boy parts- spray guard works great.
[updated]This is one of two potty seats we use in the house with our HUGE 3 year old son (45 pounds, 42" tall).The seat is well constructed, and has some nice features. In particular, it has two braces which can be moved by turning a dial accessible while the seat is on the toilet, to make the potty seat tightly held in the toilet seat, and therefore stable. That's nice.The plastic is smooth and easy to clean. And unfortunately, I spend a lot of time cleaning this potty seat and around it when my boy pees sitting down. Originally I thought this was because of the potty seat design.The front splash guard is raised to keep the child from missing the potty entirely, which is great. However, it's not aimed downward but instead is straight up and down. Unless I'm extremely careful to position him towards the very back of the potty seat (a problem if he will poo), my son winds up hitting himself, the toilet seat, and for all I know the ceiling when he pees. Worse, the pee splashes up underneath the potty seat and pools around the inside of the black rubber seal around the potty seat's edge. It's a mess, and requires cleaning the toilet seat every time I remove the potty seat from top of it.I guess I should consider this incentive to get him to learn to point down when he pees, but when you're potty training and just trying to get your kid to use the toilet at all, it's a pain.So, five star construction, comfort for sitting, and the adjustable fit. 3 stars for hygeine and spraying my son with his own pee. Average is four stars.Addendum: Since writing this review I've used a few other potty seats, which has improved my opinion of THIS one. Unfortunately unless you teach your boy to aim downwards, pee is going all kinds of places you don't want with pretty much any potty seat. This potty seat's front piece extends further down than a travel potty seat, for example, which is good. In this potty seat, there's sprayback, but in a travel potty seat, the pee can actually shoot UNDER the toilet seat and above the toilet, at the hapless parent foolish enough to stand in front of the boy. And I get some sprayback. So, given a choice between these two design options, I think the babybjorn probably makes the right choice. Bumping the star rating from 3 to 4 to reflect this. I'd still like a miracle solution, if anyone knows one!
This is perfect.  It adjusts very easily to any bowl, is firm and steady when it attaches, pops on and off in a second.  There's nothing to improve and nothing more we could want.
Although the adjuster to fit on our oval toilet doesn't work on it, it doesn't matter because it has a rubber edge that keeps it in place easily, for all 3 of my triplets, and they're all different sizes.
Don't get me wrong, our Bjorn trainer is a keeper- has a great seal, extra pee guard in the front, adjustable fit, and the handle makes for easy storage and cleanup. But, when it comes to toilet seats for training...let's be honest...you can find a cheaper one that does the job. This one is just maybe the Cadillac of trainers? I wouldn't buy this one again, but would certainly want one as a gift!
My kids wanted to sit on the toilet quickly, but of course, were too small.  These seats are great for potty trainers or small kids.
Have two of these (one for upstairs, one for down) as well as the Baby Bjorn freestanding potty. With a step stool, my 2 year old can put this on the toilet herself and get up onto it. Love the little potty as well, but obviously prefer that there is no clean up required with the seat toppers. Fits all three of our toilets perfectly and very comfortable for our child.
Great seat! This is our second one in 4 years and two kids! The first one had the handle crack.I bought a different potty seat to replace this one initially and it was sent back quickly in favor of this seat!There is a dial that turns to adjust two plastic pieces that sizes it for your toilet.My son is 3 and he knows how to use the potty all by himself. He is able to put this down on the toilet and get on and off it himself. There is no leakage between the seat and the toilet seat and the guard works well.I fully expect that my daughter will be able to use this seat when she is ready to potty train.
I recommend this potty seat to all the mom's I know. We had a different brand one before buying this seat and it pinched my sons private parts. This seat is all one piece and is easy for my son to put on and take off the potty. It has a wheel that adjust so it can fit in different size toilets. It has a convenient handle for carrying and hanging and is super easy to clean.You can not go wrong with this seat!!
I didnt know you had to lift the seat up to use this.  there is a rubber thing inthe back that stops you from placing it on the seat itself, you need to lift up the seat and place it on the dirty part of the rim....all b/c of that stupid rubber thing in the back.  I evem tried cutting it off, but it still doesnt help.  this was a poor design.
They thought about the little things that would make this better than the competition.  Kept the price reasonable.  Very happy.
This is a great adapter for a normal adult seat. This makes it easy for your toddler to use the potty without feeling as though they are going to fall into the toilet. My only complaint is that it does not secure well to the toilet itself. It can easily be pulled off. And it is not easy to store in that it is wide at the top. Overall, though great from potty training your little to use a big toilet versus the potty seats.
My daughter really likes her pink potty seat. It is very comfortable for her as well as easy for her to put on the potty herself which is important to her.
For some reason my son likes this better than sitting on his own baby potty. He has yet to &#34;go&#34; but at least, for now, he wants to sit on the toilet.
Great design--we haven't actually used it yet, but I like how it fits on the toilet seat.  It seems like it would fit any seat.  We were trying to introduce our baby to potties really early, but have been lazy about it.  We also have the other Bjorn toilet and she doesn't mind sitting on that one.  But we can use it on the changing table, so it's easier for us. She's 8 months.
I did a lot of research before purchasing a seat to go on our toilet. I already have a Bjorn stand alone potty but my daughter didn't seem to be comfortable on it for more than a minute or two and she wanted to sit on the big potty but is just too small. So I figured a seat to go on the regular toilet would be the way to go. So far though it hasn't gotten her to go she does seem comfortable sitting on it. The design is really clever and I do believe that it would fit on any seat tightly the way it's adjustable. It's nice to feel comfortable that it's not going to slide around. I think this is definitely the way to go for toilet training.Update 11/21/2011: My daughter is now actually using the seat instead of just sitting on it:) This seat has successfully taught her how to use the potty. We like it so much that for our travels over the holidays we've ordered another seat to be sent to where we'll be spending the holidays so she'll have the exact same seat there. Very happy with this product. Also I've noticed that though she's a girl it's still helpful that this unit has a splash guard on it.
Here is what I like about this:- you can adjust some fitting with the turn of a dial on the inside back of the seat so that it doesn't shift when on the Toilet (this way I can use it on different toilet bowls and it sits steady)- just one piece (that way things don't get in between the pieces), less mess and easy to clean- contoured etc and all the stuff they say in their descriptionWhat I wish was different:  I wish that the seat was a little cushioned.  If he's been on the potty for a while, poor thing has red marks on his butt. (it goes away, just don't like seeing that)
We bought two. Have it up and downstairs our almost three year old likes this more then the potty chair. You must buy a stool with it but otherwise great
LOVE THIS SEAT! Well designed to adjust to many different sizes of toilets. Super easy to clean after each use. Just rinse with warm water and let air dry. I purchased one for each bathroom and also a few for the grandparents house. Stores away easily. LOVE IT!
Haven't had the opportunity to need this yet as we are still utilizing the baby potty seated on the floor as our guy is too little to get on the regular potty yet.  However, wanted to get everything together and ready when we will need it.  This seat is very well made and really like that it is all one piece so there is no need to worry about bacteria collecting around a "snap on" deflector (for boys).  Purchased 2 of these, one for myself at my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law at theirs, as they are in the process of potty training our grandson.  It was easy to adjust to fit our regular seats, and I now have it on a hook next to the regular potty when the time comes that we are ready to use it.  I also purchased the stool and potty book...and am ready whenever my kiddies are.  Highly recommend this seat as it very well made.
I read several reviews before settling on this one.  Initially, I was considering the potty with the ladder but breakage, slippage and space were an issue with that one.  This turned out to be the ideal potty seat for us.  It fits over my elongated toilet seat comfortable without slipping so I have no fear of it falling in when my little ones rush to the potty.  They even put it on the seat themselves.  It little ridge on the front are perfect for little boys and avoid any leakage or spilling!  The kids love that they have their own seat that is so comfortable.  Baby Bjorn products are always well-made and well suite for the their particular purpose and this one proves that.  It gives me peace of mind knowing that my little ones can use it easily without fear of them slipping off of it or the seat falling into the bowl.  Great potty seat!
I love the dial on the back that makes it really secure on any shape seat. It doesn't shift side to side and feels like an extension of the real toilet seat because of how secure it stays in place. If you've ever had a kid fall into the toilet you know important that feature is!
I was having a hard time finding a potty seat that fit our elongated bowl in the basement bathroom, until I came across this seat.  The dial in back made for a snug fit.  The seat doesn't move at all and #1 &  #2 go where they belong.  Haven't had any issues cleaning it up.
We have a standard size and shape toilet seat. Yet, this potty seat fits the seat in an awkward manner, causing pee to leak both on top and under the front of the toilet seat. Granted, I have little boys, so maybe this isn't so much of a problem with girls.We had MUCH better luck with the Mommy's Helper Cushie Tushie potty seat (the one with the ducks on it), which is, incidentally, much cheaper and easier to clean. The same unfortunate pee situation never happens with that seat.
My son prefers to use this seat instead of the small stand alone potties. I guess because he feels like a big kid using the big potty. Its dimensions are perfect and he can sit without any danger of falling in or feeling off balance. We also haven't had any accidents with pee splashing out of it, so the pointy splashguard at the end seems to work. I'd give it five stars if it had handles on the side like I've seen on other training potties.
Seat works well, adjustable & fits our toilet well (standard seat). Stays in place well, and my baby can sit on it himself (he is 5 months old). We've been using it since he was 3 or 4 months, and it worked well then too.
Easy to install, comfortable for my son to sit on and has a very useful splash guard. The seat blends in very well with the bathroom and can be easily hung when not in use. Of all the seats out there, this one seems to be one if the most well made and most functional. Would highly recommend.
This Toilet Trainer is more than a trainer.  It snaps into the opening of a standard flip seat of an adult toilet, allowing a small child to seat on the toilet without falling in.  A 3-year old can put it in place, making the child independent.  The prongs that hold it in place are not very stiff, so the seat is easy to remove, even for a child.  Thus even after the child is &#34;trained,&#34; the seat is useful.
I bought it based on so many great reviews. I wonder if I am the only one who was not able to attach it to the existing toilette seat. The description says "adjusts easily and sits firmly in place"...well, it does not. It slides right out of the existing seat. SO I basically keep in there not attached at all and have to sit my child and remove him from there, otherwise the seat falls out.
Before we bought this we have used two of the princelionheart wee pod basic which crack every single time. I decided to try this one out. It does seem a bit more pricey than other toilet seats but it is worth it. It is adjustable and allows the child to sit more naturally on the  toilet than the thick padded seats.
and prevents my daughter of falling into the toilet. it does get a little dirty and requires a regular wipe down, but i like this (plus a step booster) more than the little potty. our daughter also likes that this helps her use the same potties mama and daddy use.
Easy to install. Now if potty training was just as easy.  Easy to clean the toilet still too. Would recommend.
This lid is great for my petite 3 year old to use. It adjusts to fit most toilet lids- does not fit well on grandma's already contoured seat. This is a hard, but perfectly contoured seat for a little bottom. We have the cushioned one, with little ducks which is nice, but this is really a step up. It has the nice guard in front to help minimize over shoot. I really liked this one enough to purchase a second for trips to grandma's. It is strong, sturdy, easy to clean. It comes in other colors, but I only have white. It is great how it adjusts to fit snugly with my lid underneath. Since my daughter is petite she has a hard time getting high enough to just sit- she has to "shimmy" and this snug lid is very safe for her to shimmy onto with out moving. Worth the extra money.
This potty seat fits very nicely on our elongated toilet seats. The adjustable fitting makes it nice and snug so the kids don't wiggle at all on the seat. We are just beginning to potty train so it hasn't had much actual use yet and I can't speak to how well it works otherwise.
This seat fits my toilet beautifully and only wished I bought it from the get go.  Nice quality seat, smooth and easy to clean, and fits my elongated toilet seat perfectly (due to the adjustability of the seat).  Most importantly, my son is very comfortable using it and no longer fears the seat moving on him and now is getting on and off the potty by himself.  Dramatic change in just 2 days of getting the seat.  Worth every penny in my book!
I tried a few different seats and nothing fit my oval shaped Toto seats well.The adjusters in this allow it to fit the seat perfectly. It's sturdy, and easy to clean.  Hangs perfectly with the potty hook.Great product!
my son started using this potty at 6 months. it is one of the only potties small enough for infant potty training. the potty has a great splash gard, and appears to be shaped to help my son go. almost like the squatting position you see kids do in diapers.although i have seen kids as old as 2.5 using this potty, it appears to be geared more for younger ones.
Although I am a die hard Baby Bjorn fan, I am not a true fan of the LITTLE potty.  It's small in design, with no removable bowl which makes it very hard to keep clean.  Save your money and upgrade to the Baby Bjorn regular potty which is well worth the money!!  We keep our little potty in the minivan for those unexpected road trip emergencies.
We take this little potty with us everywhere.  I actually purchased online from Amazon specifically to find the one piece BabyBjorn Little Potty (BBLP) after my friends raved about it.It now lives permanently in the back of my car, so that my toddler can have easy access to a potty when we're on the go.  I've also taken this on planes and trips in our carry-on, so that we would have access to a potty ...even if there was not a bathroom available.  With little ones it is so hard for them to wait, and this helps keep them potty-independent.Also, if you do infant pottying or elimination communication, this is one of the &#34;must-have&#34; pottys.  The seat is a little on the smaller side compared to the standard little pottys you'll find at Toys R Us or wherever ...which makes it ideal for little ones (I am talking 1 year or younger).
It is small enough & light-weight enough to take anywhere. My son's little, petite bum fits great on this potty. He can get on & off of it easily as well. The price was well worth it!
We got this potty for our 2 1/2 little girl after she was potty trained for little over a month. We have the bigger Baby Bjorn potty for home, but we quickly learned that she is terrified of big toilets when we're away from the house. We keep this potty in our car and it's been great! She knew it was a potty as soon as she saw it because it's the same color as her big one and it has the same bear on it. We take it to friends' houses when we're over there, and we even have her use it in the car when we're away from the house for long periods of time. She thinks it's great (and funny) that she gets to "pee in car" and has used it right away every time. I'm not sure how other parents bridge the gap of potty-training while away from the house, but this works perfectly for us!! In fact, we're taking her on a plane for the first time in a couple months and plan on taking this potty in our carry-on. I recommend it to anyone. Oh, and it's much shorter than her big potty, but she doesn't seem to mind one bit. Honestly, I wish we had gotten this one first for when she was really little and interested in the potty (we got her first potty at 16-months, but she still had a hard time getting on it herself because she was so small). So if you're starting with a little one, this would be perfect!!
For all those EC moms, this is a perfect product. It's a nice small size (for infants) and easy to use and clean.
We have one of the larger Baby Bjorn potties for each of our girls, 3 years and 20 months. However, the younger one has a bit of difficulty sitting down on the larger one because of the shield in the front. She often gets so frustrated with the larger potty that she tries to turn the receptacle around, which of course, doesn't help matters.This small potty has been an ideal solution. It's reasonably priced, and the perfect size for a child under 2 years who is learning to use the potty or just has potty curiousity after watching an older sibling use the potty. We knew buying it that it will likely be a temporary potty, and that when she's too big for it, she can graduate to the larger one.My only complaints are as follows:-Judging from the marks on her bum, I don't believe that it's quite as comfortable as the larger version for long periods of sitting, and she's our second to have that tendency to "camp" on the potty.-The ease of dumping it is somewhat less that the larger Bjorn potty. Where we can rinse the receptacle for the larger one in the bathroom sink, this one is just large enough that we have to rinse it in the bathtub, and there's a bit more area that needs to be cleaned, with it all being one piece. Since we don't really plan on making it the long-term potty, and more just a trainer, this isn't such a big deal.So, if you're looking for a small potty for a younger child that will temporarily suit them perfectly, look no further. A nice bonus is how little space this potty takes up! I think it's the smallest potty we've encountered yet. Just be prepared for a little extra work in the clean-up department, and a new potty or seat adapter somewhere between the age of two and three, as this potty will surely be outgrown early on.
We used this chair starting when my daughter was around 8 months old and it was the perfect fit for her.  It was comfortable (or so it seemed) and easy to keep clean!She is 18 months now and we still use it often every day and we have more than gotten our money's worth - but I think she is getting a bit big for it now.  I am eyeing moving up to the regular size Bjorn potty seat, which I hope will be a little more comfortable for her height.
My third son was bigger than average and had NO ISSUE sitting on this potty.  I don't understand the negative reviews because of the size of the potty for normal potty training(I've never done the baby potty thing).  He was two and a half by the time he was potty trained, used this potty (off and on) until he was almost four (we've only one bathroom, so he used it "in case of emergency!).  This potty beats the one I used for my first two boys BY A LAND SLIDE!  This one has NO CRACKS OR CREVASSES!  The ones with the take out pot some how ALWAYS get urine under them.  YUCK!  I love how easy this is to clean.  I rinse it out well then wipe it out with a Clorox wipe.  After all the uses, it doesn't smell like urine or excrement at all.I'm on here ordering another one for my little girl so I can have two--one upstairs and one downstairs.  You can not go wrong with this potty!
This is perfect for my 20 month old.  She can sit on it on her own.  It is VERY small.  Imagine a gallon of milk cut in half.  My daughter is small for her age and it fits her perfectly.  There is no problem emptying it.  We just add a small amount of water and dump it in the toilet.  Then a quick rinse and dump that in the toilet.  This is much better than seats on the real toilet that she feels uncomfortable on.  She is relaxed on this and that makes all of the difference.  It is perfect for us, but be aware it is small.
Perfect little potty, I'm using for EC with my 3month old and it is working beautifully, easy to grab nice neat compact size and just great to have around! I'm glad I chose this potty!
This is the best potty. It stays really clean because it's just one piece of shaped plastic. Also the splash guard is important, even for girls. The other potty leaked out the front. Also it's light and easy to take to the beach or wherever we go.
I got two of these after starting EC with my 9 month old.  The potty is a perfect size for a young child/baby who is beginning to use the potty.  My son can't get on it by himself, but can get off...his feet touch the floor when he is seated and he is low enough to reach for toys.  The one piece design is great for cleaning.  Other reviews said that they wished Bjorn would make a clear potty like this which is why I got white (next best thing for seeing when he's done).  If you are considering trying EC...don't hesitate you will be shocked how readily young children will indicate they need to potty and will use the potty consistently.  Great quality product for price!
We have been using this potty for our 2 1/2 month old (yes, you read that correctly) for a few weeks now.  While she is still too small to actually sit on it by herself (she'd fall right in), we hold her over it when we think she needs to empty the tank and have had much success with it.  Before you jump down my throat over why I shouldn't be using this for such a tiny baby, I'll defend myself by saying sometimes she will fuss uncontrollably and it will calm her immediately to have her diaper removed and have the opportunity to relieve herself without the confines of a diaper.  This potty has been a wonderful solution to that problem.It's definitely small, but since my baby is a particularly petite baby to begin with, I reckon she'll probably be close to completely potty trained before she outgrows this.  It's a nice size for us right now, however.Cleaning it is relatively simple with dumping the waste into the toilet, rinsing it out, then wiping it down with disinfecting wipes.  One feature I really would love to have in this is a pour spout somewhere to make dumping the waste a cleaner task.  Because of this lack of design feature, you are faced with two options when emptying the potty out: flip it upside-down really fast to avoid getting waste spread around the edges (never tried it...sounds too risky) or pour it out over the side and be faced with the waste spreading all over the side you dumped it from.  I'm sure nobody is a fan of dripping baby pee and poop or having to wipe up more than necessary.  A pour spout would have been a simple solution to this problem.Otherwise, we are completely pleased with this product.  I can imagine having a second one for the car down the line might be a good investment considering how reasonably priced it is.Update: We still use this now that our daughter is five months old.  We saw that Ikea has a $5 potty, so we got one to have a secondary use potty.  I hate to say it, but Ikea perfected the "spout" design to cleanly pour out waste.  The Ikea potty is bigger and the opening is wider, so we have to be more careful about her backside falling in and it appears to be a bit more uncomfortable for smaller babies.  For that reason, I still prefer the size and shape of the Baby Bjorn potty.  I wish these two potties could get together and create a perfect design for little babies :)
started taking baby potty at 2 months - he's 5 months now (17 lbs, 26" tall), & can sit on this potty himself. it is so easy to clean & take to work with me, & fits him great!
We bought this potty chair after much research and also owning another one - a Winnie the Pooh Potty chair with a removable urine shield that pops off too easily and just asks to be lost.  This chair is so much better that it doesn't even compare.  Our son has been using it to go to the bathroom (so far just pee pees :) ) for several months and loves it.  In contrast, he is lukewarm about the other chair.The best things about this chair:1)  Simple two piece design means that it is easy to clean.  The bowl lifts out and rinses easily.  Other potties seem to have 5 or more pieces, just asking for places to trap dirt.  Not a good thing with a potty2)  built in urine shield (into the bowl) works great and our son loves sitting on it.  It is a nightly ritual before his bath.3)  inexpensiveDownside?  We haven't found a downside yet.
Simple! Love it. Love the high back and the front lift. Very good price
Simple design that:- allows child to sit rather then have to support themselves (important esp when they start potty training at an earlier age)- the entire seat area comes off so it's easy to clean and dump into toilet and rinse- comes in many colors to suit your liking- bottom has a rubber gasket surrounding the entire outside lip so that it creates good traction- durable and so no worry about breaking this when a child is breaking or when you are moving it a lot
This is my second potty purchase and I truly wished it had been my first. My first was the fisher price fun to learn potty, which costs about $5 more and is shaped like a regular toilet with the pretend flush handle. My son thought it was a toy and constantly "flushed" to hear the music instead of sitting on it. When this potty arrived and I took it out the box, he grabbed it and said "mine" and immediately sat down on it. He started using it the very next day and it's been a success so far. I don't know if it's the potty or if he's just ready to be potty trained (he just turned 3) but I do know that he loves his potty. I highly recommend getting this and forget about the bells and whistles of the fisher price model.
My daughter is on the thinner side and at 18 months struggles to get comfortable in this chair. She's not able to sit on it without falling in. There's no way that she could sit on this for any length of time because she's having to hold her weight so she doesn't fall in. In addition, the splash guard makes sitting on this super awkward. Another mother wrote about how her daughter needed stitches after cutting her genitals on the splash guard. I can totally see how this can happen. It's not safe for your child to independently seat themselves without some help.
My boy is a big boy and it fits him perfect! His feet hit the floor perfectly too and great height for him. Somehow won't tip.. nicely engineered!
I never know what i would have done without it...Potty training was a breeze with the help of this potty chair..My baby loves her little red potty...
We used this through two kids and while they both only used it for a short period of time it was very easy to use and clean.  Not a lot of nooks or crannies so you only had to wipe it down.
We used this for both of our boys and am glad to say they are now successfully trained.  This is a low price, high quality option.
I started using this potty with my daughter when she was just able to sit up on her own.  The high back was more helpful then, than it is now, but it's still nice to have the high back.  She likes to lean back and throw her arm over the back.  She thinks she's so cool when she sits on her big girl potty.I like the &#34;handle&#34; on the front shield because my daughter hangs onto it and leans slightly forward when using the potty for #2.I like the design of the bowl and how it fits in the potty.  No leaks.  The potty chair my mom has, if my daughter is at a certain angle somehow it leaks onto the floor.  That has never happened with this potty chair.PROS:- High back to help support baby- No-slip bottom keeps potty from sliding on tile floorCONS:- Haven't thought of any yetI bought a second one of these to leave at day care.
Easy to clean, easy on my son's bottom. This looks great in our small guest bathroom by my son's sticker chart, Wee Pod Basix and potty book.
My little girls likes using this over the other potty that we got, personally i think it works better than other, cheaper ones, i like the hard seat so she doesnt want to sit there forever, and it forces her to get in the proper "position" which she doesnt always achieve the other potty.
Since we practice elimination communication we looked for a potty that would work well for a young child who just began sitting with no (or very little) support. We started using this when our LO was 5.5months old. From the age of 6.5 months or so, our LO was really comfortable on this potty (it was OK earlier, but only for very short duration). It is very steady, and super easy to keep clean -- you just take out the inner compartment and wash it out. We are very happy with the decision to go with this model.
So we have been using this potty seat for several months now trying to get our daughter used to going on the potty.  I bought this one because it had great reviews and was simple and easy to clean.  But every time we put her on it, after only a few minutes she starts complaining that her feet hurt.  What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep.  Then she doesn't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared.  She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her.  Also, every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it.  It also leaves her with a red ring around her butt.  I am going to look for a cushioned potty chair next and hopefully we have more success.
Excellent product.  My son is just a bit too small, but he'll grow into this potty.  It has a solid back if he leans back, and a little lip so he won't pee right at you.
Bought for our 30 month old grandson. .He likes it. .He sits and holds a few toys while &#34;making&#34;..it cleans up very well..no issues..I should get 2 more
I chose this chair based on its reviews, and I am glad that I did! I can't speak for how it works for a boy, but it seemed to be really comfortable for our daughter. It's easy to clean and looks nice in the bathroom, instead of looking like just another piece of baby gear. I also like that there weren't any crazy sounds or anything like that since it made the chair seem like a more realistic potty.
Would be nice if the white container was made with a little cushion for the small tush, but it's nice in that it's easy to clean and easy for the little ones to sit on.  My 12 month old has no problems sitting in it.
We also have the blue potty as well and love them both. We have 1 upstairs and 1 downstairs for our 2 yr old son who is potty trained..I love how high up the lip is on this potty, thus preventing any addicents. Very easy to clean as well and no leaking noted. We researched plenty of potty seats and found this to be the best for boys.
This potty is just great.  My baby has been using this since she was 9.5 months old.  I love the fact that it has a chair-back so she doesn't need me to physically support her when she's on it.  All I have to do is watch her nearby.  It's really well made and very sturdy.  Also, the basin is big enough that it holds everything without spills and mess.  She doesn't mind sitting on it for 10 monutes in the mornings to do her thing...and she does pretty much without fail.  We haven't had to change a poop diaper for weeks now.  One of the most useful items I bought for the baby!
we got this chair for our son to learn to use the potty. its sturdy and comfortable for him which is great. i like that the bowl is big enough that there is no spraying on the floor and i can actually see when he goes as opposed to him standing up for me to look. its easy for him to get on and off of by himself which is another big plus. i LOVE how easy it is to clean, much easier than the other potty chair we have which is 3 separate pieces.it may not have any fancy extras but it gets the job done!
looks cute but not functional for us.the depth of the plastic bowl is not deep.If the shit is coming out long and hard, it might push back up to the baby
With my first son, i bought the boon potty bench, I did consider this one, but at the time, I wanted the step stool option.  The potty bench worked, but with my twins I needed another potty and got this one.  LOVE IT!  I wish I would've had it for my first son and just got a separate step stool.  I have boy/girl twins that are 2 1/2 years old.  They both can use it very easily, they don't have to take their bottoms off all the way.  That was something I couldn't tell with the pictures 'cause of the way it's shaped.  It's so easy to clean.  They like to dump it themselves in the big toilet and it's easy for them to do that .  There are no spills with the pee guard.  Funny thing was when I first got it, my four year old son wanted to try it out.  He's about 50 lbs and 47&#34; tall and even he fit on it!  It's so light and portable.  I would recommend this to anyone.
This a nicely molded piece of plastic- simple, no sharp edges.  Just the right size.  Our son started sitting on it for pracice at 11 mo.  His feet can be on the ground and hye likes to sit on it.  The pail comes out easily to  dump and the bottom has rubber, so it doesn't slip on the floor. Shield is also high enough for potty.
Awesome!!!! My son who is 40lbs and only 2 years old can't fit onto any other seat. Plus this one is soooo  great for boys, there is plenty of space and the guard in front makes it really easy!!! I love it!!!
I have 2 of these for my twins. Having gone through the search of a good one with my first child, I found this and bought 2. It's simple to clean, you take out the wipe potty part by hooking some fingers to the front and dump the contents into the toilet. Rinse it and you're ready to go. You can sanitize it with some clorox spray and just put it back down until the next time.  It's portable so you can have it anywhere. There is an anti slip rubber on the bottom so no worries about pottying children ending up somewhere else than where you left them.My twins are now potty trained, but I still keep one in the back of the van for emergencies. You never know if you'll make it to the next toilet, you know?
For nearly a year, I have been struggling to help my now three-year-old become potty trained.  We have tried four other potty seats, and all have proved difficult to use:-We first tried the Primo Ducka toilet seat (looks like a duck), and while it was cute and engaging, he could not climb on the toilet to use it by himself, and it often directed the liquid flow right between the toilet and seat (what a mess!).-Next, we used an old-fashioned wooden potty chair (the kind with a high back and arm rests), but this had a separate plastic guard that hurt my son and also allowed liquid to leak.-The third potty chair we tried was the Baby Bjorn Little Potty, which slid too easily on our bathroom floor, was too low to the ground, and always allowed liquid to drip along the outside when tipped in the toilet during cleaning.-My son did enjoy the next potty - a "Peter Potty" toddler urinal.  It was great fun to stand like Daddy, and it even had a water tank so that it could be "flushed" like a real potty.  After several months, however, the top water tank started dripping often, and the bottom reservoir was so hard to pull out that when it finally let loose, liquid sloshed out!Frustrated, I set out to scour Amazon for one final shot at a potty that would work for my son and would be easy to clean.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided upon the Baby Bjorn potty chair, allowed my son to be involved by selecting a color (blue)...and couldn't be happier with our choice!My son has been excited about his new blue Baby Bjorn potty chair since the UPS driver brought it to our house, and I am impressed as well.  This potty chair is tall enough that it is comfortable for him to sit upon, there are no separate guards that pinch him, the rubber bottom prevents it from sliding on our floor, it has a back and armrests that help my son stand up after going potty, he can use it by himself, AND it's super easy to clean!  I have found that if you pour the liquid out the back of the potty chair insert (where the white bowl curves upward), the liquid does not run down the outside of the container like other potty chairs.Overall, while a bit pricey, this is without a doubt the best potty chair we have found for our toddler boy.  I would highly recommend that other parents try this chair before wasting their money on any others!
Our daughter loves using this chair.  It is stable and very easy to clean.
We owned our last blue babybjorn potty for over 10 years. It survived 4 children.  Unfortunately, it was accidentally cleaned with a substance that ruined the coating.We decided to go with a bjorn again and we are please with this one.  It is a large potty seat so this will fit a large child.  The white part removes easily so that it can be given a quick rinse.A child can lean back and not fall off the potty. The seat is big enough so a child can sit easily without hurting themselves.Overall, I am please with the purchase.
I love this potty chair!My son barely used it, just for the beginning month of his potty training but it had many very nice qualities and I would recommend it highly.The color is pretty and the chair is cute. I like my bathroom to look nice and it didnt bother me to see this in there every day.The skid rubber on the bottom really hung on to the ground well, even in those times when some bath water had gotten on the floor. It is very stable and wont move around on you or your toddler.the design is simple, which means that clean up is simple as well. the removable piece just comes out and is a breeze to clean.The high back and sides make it safer for wiggly toddlersI loved everything about this and am glad I shelled out the extra money... not only that but when it was time to sell it I got a decent amount of money for it because its a name brand and they are so expensive
Our three year old son immediately loved this chair (we ordered it in his "favowit" color green).  He is fairly tall for his age but can still sit in it comfortably and it looks like shorter children could as well.  My only complaint is that when he stands to tinkle, the urine inevitably hits the back of the seat and the design is such that it leaks underneath.  It's easy for us to clean because we have mostly hardwood or tile floors but I can wouldn't recommend this for homes with mostly carpeting.  I know our son likes to have his potty chair in various rooms in the house so it could make quite a mess.  Other than that, though, it's lightweight, easy to transport if needed, easy to clean/dump in the toilet and my son loves it.
First time potty training for our 14 months daughter.  Too many choices available on the market, but trusted all the other reviews on Amazon. This no frills potty chair doesnt look like much, but I really think they did a wonderful job designing it.  Easy to clean, and my toddler isnt uncomfortable sitting on it to go potty.  The high back rest helps alot, because she tends to sit far back to get comfortable.  Its very stable and we dont worry about it tipping over.Good value, nice design, and definitely easy to clean.  Highly recommended.
My 2.5 year old just wants to play with this and not use it as a potty. She discovered that the seat insert makes a great cowboy hat and is also fun to stand in and push around the house and put her toys inside and underneath it. I tried every rookie mom mistake to get her to take it seriously and nothing seems to be working. She only wants to potty train on the real toilet and, hey, that's not a bad thing. Just wish I knew before I bought it! I'd suggest starting with the real toilet and a seat to fit on top before buying this. Otherwise, it's a great potty chair! I think it's well made, a good size and has a nice simple design. That's why I gave it 4 stars.
When starting potty training, this seat was the perfect size for my toddler. It was comfortable for her height and she was willing to sit on it for more than a minute. The contents are easily to empty out and wash. There are rubber grips underneath the seat to prevent it from sliding around. No complaints!
We have been loosely potty training, at my daughter's discretion (self-lead...working beautifully) for a little over 6mos, and recently she has become very independent about it all -- she literally holds up her hand to stop us from following her to the bathroom to use the potty sometimes!  We have always just had a cushioned training seat on the big potty, and had recently gotten a potty seat with an attached "step ladder", but she had trouble getting her pants down safely once she was up there, so she couldn't REALLY go and do it by herself.  I thought I would give the floor-potty a chance, and got this one.  She immediately said "I want to go pee pee!" and so I showed her that she couljd stand on the floor, take off her own pants/pull-up and go...she did, and the potty is super sturdy, it's the perfect size for her tiny little hiney (she's only 23.6lbs at a little over 2yrs!), and she had no trouble at all getting on or getting up...the "arm rests" were a great way to help herself get back up - might want to consider that if you are considering the smaller Bjorn potty chair.  It emptied easy as pie, and was ridiculously easy to clean and sanitize...but once I did that, she grabbed it and put it back in the shipping box...she just prefers the seats on the "big girl potty".  Otherwise, great little chair, for sure.I would mention, the "lip" that is there to prevent issues for little boys or "forward spillage" during a pee, might prove a little tough to maneuver or might get a little boy caught on it...I'm sure they have to be high enough to actually prevent the spill/splash, but this one took my daughter a moment to get over the little hump, and being a girl she doesn't even have the "extra accessories".
I bought this potty chair after looking at several other brands/styles because of the high back and arm support. It has a great "wrap-around" design that is perfect for my 4-month-old who is just getting familiar with the potty. For those working on infant potty training, I highly recommend this chair. My little one has no problem sitting up in this chair by herself (of course I'm holding onto her for security). She has already made many, many poops and pees in the Baby Bjorn Potty Chair! It's also very easy to clean. Just dump out contents, rinse, and wipe with a disposable disinfecting wipe. Definitely easier than changing a diaper!
This potty is very nice. I bought this because of the sleek look, high back. It will work fine. My daughter turns 2 yrs old soon, I will then try her on it if she is ready.
Our son is not potty training yet but, he loves to sit on his potty. We placed it in the bathroom and every time before he takes as bath, we take off his diaper and he immediately sits on the potty. With a high back, he looks comfortable and relaxed sitting on it. Lots of great colors to choose from. Simple yet smart design.
Our first potty for our daughter had one of those squishy foam-type seats. We thought that would be more comfortable, but soon realized it just irritated her bum. It had a huge reservoir, was a pain to dump and clean, and that foam part was always getting dirty and could never be completely cleaned.A friend had a Baby Bjorn, and seemed happy with it, so we gave it a try. My daughter chose her own color - I love that there are so many options - and we ended up with a green one. She loves this potty. It seems comfortable, and she doesn't get that red ring around her bottom from sitting on it. And best of all, it's SO EASY TO CLEAN. The reservoir is compact and can be rinsed in a small bathroom sink, but holds plenty. If you forget to dump it once, it won't overflow on the second use.My first daughter still prefers this potty over using the adult one. She's 3.5, and big for her age. The size of this potty is very versatile, and I think it will last her a good while longer if she needs it to.Now my second daughter is getting to the potty-training age (18 months), and we've invested in a second one in her favorite color, yellow (it's actually a lovely shade). The same potty that can accomodate my preschooler works just as well for my little toddler, and that's a great feature.I have zero complaints about the Bjorn potty. It's absolutely worth the extra money.
I love the look and it's appears to clean easily, but we haven't used it much to give good feedback. Our 21 month old will go sit on it without guidance, but he wants to pul out the bowl and take it with him. Hopefully when we officially start potty training, it will be fine.
I am potty training my 19 month old daughter. She is my 6th child and I have owned a league of potties over the years. The problem with so many potties that I find is that there are too many bells and whistles that make potty time more of playtime than getting down to business. This potty is super simple to clean which is a BIG bonus over other potties. You simply pick up the insert, dump it into the toilet and rinse out the insert. I usually just use a clorox wipe to clean it out. The shield is high enough that a boy will not pee all over himself, but short enough that a little girl will not jab herself while trying to sit down. My daughter is 19 months and 24 lbs and this seat is the perfect height for her. As said, my twin 3 year old sons have used this a few times (when both just gotta go at the same time and one is already on the big potty)and had absolutely no issues with it at all. I wish I would have bought this the first time instead of spending hundreds on other potties over the past decade.
Love this potty! It's white and matches our bathroom nicely...it blends in. EASY to use and clean, SIMPLE too. Recommended also by "Toddler Bargains". Have not been disappointed!
It does the job.  She was potty trained within a month I think due to being able to leave this in the livingroom so she could always see it.
I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles, flush noises, music, lights, the works.  Then I thought, wait a minute, the regular potty doesn't have those things.  She wants one like mommies! I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read "the potty book for girls" She was immediately  sitting on it without any prompting. Once I finally took her pants off she went right away.  We are still working on going always on the potty, but she loves the potty itself.  It is very basic and sturdy.  My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front.  I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the "big" potty.
I purchased this seat when my firstborn was a toddler. I'm guessing he was around 2.5 years old.It came with 2 pieces: a base and a cup.The base has a wide, stable bottom on it to prevent tipping and a nice back on it. There is rubber on the bottom to add stability and keep the potty from sliding across the floor. There are no sharp corners  - just curves which are very easy to keep clean. There is a hole in the base; the cup is set into this hole, overlapping the edges. The edges all slope towards the cup so any liquid drains into the cup.The deflector is not removable; it is all one piece with the cup. I LOVE this design. It is smooth so that it will not scratch tender body parts and it cannot get lost.The cup is removed from the TOP of the base! With my other potty, I had to turn it around and remove the cup from underneath the seat. If my toddler ever tried to empty it himself, he ended up making a big mess. With this potty, it was a lot easier for him to empty it without spilling.Having the cup on top also means that he is sitting on the edges of the cup. There are no gaps or tight corners for pee to get into. The deflector could be a little higher in our experience, but it wasn't too bad. I think if it was taller, it might be annoying for a girl so I can understand why it is the height that it is.An added bonus is that this potty chair is not an eyesore. It's rounded corners and pleasing colours are easy to look at.
So far we like this chair. It is easy to clean up and easy for my son to use. Very lightweightas well. A little smaller than I would have thought, and sometimes the seat sticks, but otherwise a good chair.
We just got this potty after trying the Safety 1st potty for a couple of months. As soon as my son saw it he knew just what it was. We watch the "Once Upon a Potty" video and the old bowl style potty in it was throwing him off I think. THis is close enough to that style that he started quoting part of the video upon first site. He then stood up backed up to it and sat down without any assistance, a great improvement from the other potty. He can get up and down from it without maiming his privates. His only problem with it so far is that he's apparently gotten use to having the back pressed against his rear so he pushes all the way back on this potty too. This is a little odd given its oval shaped bowl. Hopefully our stalled potty training will get a jump start down. Just in one day he is much more eager and willing to sit on it and he giggles over quoting the video while he sits there.
We have a small bathroom so I was a little worried how this would fit in there without getting in the way, but it fits great. My toddler loves to go & sit on it & at 18 months has already did 1 & 2 in it! It's a wonderful simple design that makes it super easy to clean. Love the green color, I think the picture displays the color accurately on my computer.
This is a great training potty for toddlers. It's easy to clean and I like the light color. Very happy!
I have a 15 month old who is &#34;interested &#34; in going to the bathroom. Bought this seat so she could familiarize herself with it beforehand. She began using it the first day we brought it home. After a month she asks regularly to &#34;go potty&#34;. Perfect size. She seems comfortable- it is very stable and easy to clean.
My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations.
I bought this for potty training my 2-year old daughter but she wouldn't use it.  However, all kids are different in their potty training likes/dislikes, so I'm only saying it didn't work for us.  She preferred using the seats that go on top of your normal toilet seat or the type of potty chairs that had a lid to close.  She liked the idea of closing the potty lid.
This potty seat is perfect. My daughter is almost 3 so a bigger potty was necessary. I love the back on this as well as the splash protector in the front. Even girls can spray and make a mess! LOL My little girl picked out the green color herself and it's very pretty. It's easy and convenient to lift out the white part and pour the pee in the potty. The bottom has a good grip so it's not sliding all over the floor. Excellent product.
nice potty is easy to clean and looks alot like the adult potty so helps eliminate confusion. has worked well so far.
This is the most comfortable potty chair around! My daughter loved to sit on it for a chair when we first got it and it didn't take long at all for her to start using it as a potty ..she's almost 3 now and still uses it because she says it's more "comfy" than the big potty I think the biggest plus for her is the smooth back rest and the biggest plus for me is it's so so easy to clean!
I bought two of these for my twins when they were 14 months old.  My son was using it by 15 months.  My daughter &#34;practices&#34; on hers.  They are very simple and easy to clean.  Great for smaller tots.  Some other seats were much too big or wide for them.  And, they seem very comfortable to sit on.  The raised back adds support.
I'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair. If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy. The splash guard is way too short, my son just pees right over the top of it. I do like the separate potty and it's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply doesn't hold in the pee stream. Ugh. I'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair. MESSY.
We are taking a soft approach with potty training our 21 month old. He likes his potty chair and can sit on it comfortably, though isn't really using it much yet. Like the chair, purchased 2 of them in different colors, good size for tall 21 month old and easy to clean. I knock off one star only because I can tell the "splash control" on front for a boy isn't going to be perfect, but I think that is likely to be a problem with every potty chair out there...and no big deal since I plan to keep the potty in the bathroom only. If we do decide to take it to another room I will absolutely put something under it to protect the floors.
We have this potty in green.  I was lucky enough to find it on clearance at a local store by me for $12!!  If I would have known how much I would love this potty, I would have spent the money on it two years prior when we were potty training our first child.  I love the simple design of this potty and that it only has two parts.  It makes cleaning much easier.  No one enjoys cleaning out a potty, but it's so much easier when you only have two pieces to clean.  Our other potty had several pieces with it and a lot of cracks and crevices.  I just wipe this potty up with a lysol or clorax wipe and I'm done!
This thing is the perfect height for the boys (youngest has been sitting on it since he was 18 months, and the oldest is 4.5) to sit comfortably.  It is really easy to clean and there are no crannies for icky bits to get into.  It's pretty unobtrusive color wise, but it is kind of large. There was one incident where my older son pinched his fingers between the &#34;cup&#34; and the base, but he has since learned and we haven't had any more issues.  There is a band of rubber on the base to keep it from sliding around and it does a good job, but it seems to attract all the dust and hair in the bathroom and they stick to it pretty well, so I have to use a wet rag to rub the stuff off it every couple weeks.  Overall, great product and not too pricey.
This potty chair is perfect for my daughter as the back is higher up to support her lower back and it doesn't have all the music and sounds to distract her interest in truly trying to go potty.  She gets a toy or a small book and wants to go sit on it and try and has had off and on success with going at this point but I like how easy it is to clean too.
We received this item last week in the mail and I have to say that I am very satisfied with the quality.  This is a very sturdy chair with a nice no-slip rubber coating around the bottom edges, and this seems like a chair that will be super easy to clean.  My daughter is not quite ready for this but I am sure this is a great purchase.
I like it but like the Smart potty by BabyBjorn better. Its smaller and more easily stored away. Other than that this one is easy to use as well, inside comes out and outside easy to clean as well. it's just so big and my son seems to prefer the smart potty as well.
I am so pleased with this potty. It is very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old. It is also very easy to keep cleaned up.
This seat is easy to clean, sturdy and a nice color. We bought a potty that had a face and would play music but my son thought it was a toy. With this it's just one thing .... A potty. So he can get down to business . Nice arch too for back support.
I just received my BabyBjorn potty last week, and my daughter is only 15 months old, so I can't write about her being successful at potty training yet.  But she has already gone #1 in her potty the first time she ever sat on it bare-bottom, and I am thrilled.  I bought this potty early so she would see it around and get use to it before being expected to use it.  As soon as I took it out of the box she wanted to sit on it, and cried when I took her off or took her potty away.  And because she likes sitting on it so much, she has started sitting on it immediately after I remove her dirty diapers during her diaper change, before I put her new diapers on.  And about half the time she goes pee in it while she sits there.This potty is so sturdy and sanitary cause it is easy to clean.  I love how long and deep the opening is, and how there is no chance for leakage.  When it comes to potties, the simplest design is definitely the best.  My daughter can lean on it without it tipping over, and she loves to comfortably lean against the backrest while sitting on it.  The shape of this potty ensures that kids sit on it correctly every time.  I am so happy I read the reviews before picking a potty, and bought this one from amazon instead of just going with whatever I could find at my local stores.
This is a great little potty chair.  I like its two piece design, and how easy it is to empty.  I like the high back, and so does my son as he likes to "lounge" as he uses it.  The only downside is that the piece the comes out does sometimes stick to his behind so when he stands up there is potential for a mess, but this will be true with any two piece plastic chairs.  I really like the no slip grips on the bottom of the chair so my son can't scoot it across the floor.  All in all,  I would probably buy this chair again.
Bought this for my grandson when he comes over. It's lightweight and easy to move. He seems to like it. The plastic shroud in the front is great. My only concern is that it could be bigger. If you have a boy and get this system, you'll learn what I mean.
Our son loves this potty.  It was delivered quickly, it washes easily, and it is simply wonderful.  Only positive things to say about this potty.  Highly recommend.
This fits newborns great so if you are starting early, this is the potty to use. It has a nice high wrap around back to give support while sitting. The bottom is truly non-slip and the whole potty is so stable I use it to help stand up when sitting on the floor next to it!
Delivered timely, item as described, very nice and well made just as pictured, we are very happy.
This is a great potty. It seems very comfortable for my little guy.  He's only 9 months old, but we started potty training at 6.5 months. He loves it and stays put there.  Easy to clean.
Great size, washes well, like the red color. Not much else to say about a poo receptacle really. My son willingly sits and stays on it and that's about all I can ask for!
I bought this because of the excellent reviews, so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive.My son is 3'3" & 30 pounds. (he is almost 3 yr old) He does fit on this potty, but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes. It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said "oh mommy my legs!" It's not great to start potty training with a painful experience. He is now afraid of it.I don't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it's because he is too big for the chair, but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now. I wouldn't recommend this potty for larger children.
I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable.
we used this for a short time and eventually it just collected dust. there's options out there that aren't as clunky if your taking it to go.
This is easy to sit the baby on and easy to clean.  She doesn't get distracted or use it as a toy.  The seat is comfortable for her height and fits her bottom and legs very well.  It's not really breakable.  I like it.
I bought it for my 10-month old son who is extremely active. So when i got it, I was nit even sure I can seat him on the potty and keep him seated long enough. But the seat is so comfortable that he can sit in it and listen to a song for a minute or even two before he gets bored - that is usually enough to get him do his small business there. He even tries to play with it getting the white insert out and putting it back in like a puzzle though we try not to let him play with the potty much. Word of caution -  when I tried to seat him for the very first time, he tried to just walk out of it and went down head-first - he was not a strong walker back then but I was ready and caught him and put him right back so he did not get scared of the experience. We had to pick him up to standing until he was about 10.5 months old and became more confident standing and walking though. He can stand up carefully from it - no stumbles since then.
Very good material, nice and sturdy.  Smooth and rounded at all edges.  The design is simple enough to clean all the nooks and crannies and yet perfect for use.  Definitely deserves an award for design!  This potty is higher than a lot of the competitor's brands but it works for us because it's exactly what we needed for our daughter!
This was great for potty training and then great for teaching my son to go potty on his own.  I would recommend this chair.
We've had several potty chairs and I'd say I like this one best. It has a high back and armrests, making it comfortable for my daughter to sit. There aren't a whole lot of cracks and crevices, which makes it easy to clean. The chair is sturdy and doesn't tip over. It is larger than some of the other chairs, which were a little too small as my daughter grew. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this chair first._________________UPDATE:  This chair eventually went to my niece and nephew.  It had been a good potty chair and I was happy to share my good find with my sister-in-law.  She agreed it is a good chair.
We love this potty!! We're doing elimination communication (&#34;EC&#34;) with our daughter so we started &#34;pottying&#34; her almost as soon as she was born.  Because we didn't know any better at the time, we first used a toilet seat reducer or just held her in the infant-in-arms EC position. Luckily, at around 4 months, we found this potty and have never looked back.The high back is perfect for infants who aren't able to sit up yet fully unsupported. We still needed to closely supervise, as she would sometimes lean forward and, once, she took a dive and ended up bruising her forehead on the bathroom floor. I blame myself fully, as I had looked away momentarily. Now that our daughter is older (11 months), her feet touch the ground, so she's much more secure in the seat. She still needs close supervision though, as she likes to try and stand up out of the seat.I also love that the insert is easily removable. We just flush the &#34;contents&#34; and rinse the insert out with water in the sink. Every now and again we'll let it soak in warm soapy water, but if it's washed right away after use, it stays quite clean.All in all, this is a great potty and we're very happy with our purchase. Thanks Baby Bjorn!
This was the second potty we bought for our son, who is almost 3.  In one word - horrible.  I had a lot of hope that, with all the excellent reviews, we'd find success with this one.  The basic issue is the splash guard, which really doesn't work at all.  Pee still goes everywhere.  I'd love to find one of the old-fashioned potties with the high cupped splash guard - but that's nearly impossible.  If I had known that this potty would be no better than others I've tried, I would have saved my money.
We had a purchased a couple of other types of potty chairs for our toddler and were disappointed in the size or fit.  This one worked great - in fact we got three - one for each of the grandparents' homes as well as the toddler's home.  Easy to clean, good fit, the best we found.
I just finished potty training my oldest child and really loved this potty chair.  When we first started potty training, it was a little too big for her- so if you have a small child, it might be hard for him/her to easily get on and off of it alone.  By the time she was 2.5, she had no issues getting on and off.  The splash guard is great and makes it easy to lift out while still keeping your hands clean.  The potty part is also deep enough to hold anything in it if your child decides to bring you the potty to show you their work :)Great little potty!
I love this potty seat. There is no foam seat for the pee to seep into. Just two simple pieces that are so easy to clean. This was the best thing I could have bought for all of our potty training kids. The lip in front looked too high at first. But actually it is perfect. Perfect for girls potty training and for little boys. I would recommend this seat to anyone who has a little one potty training. I just might keep this seat forever....I will have visiting grandchildren someday. :)
This IS a great potty. Easy to clean and simple in design, HOWEVER, if your son has learned to stand up to pee, then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up.  Of course, we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl, but in the meantime, we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty, which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design, and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it.  I would've gotten their one piece smaller potty, however, my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy, so I wasn't sure if he would fit on the seat.
This is the best potty that I could find out there. The size is perfect for our small bathroom, and our 19 month old sits comfortably on it. I am sure that it would be comfortable for most children who are potty training as well. I wanted something that was comfortable, compact, and without all the bells and whistles (lights, toys, sounds, etc.). This potty is perfect and I recommend it to anyone!
We actually started with the potty inserts that go right on top of the regular toilet (built in type, portable type, and a cushioned type).  My son was refusing to use that to potty train, and we decided to try this one instead.  It took awhile, but now he's using this exclusively.He likes it because it is just his size, doesn't require help from us, and can be put right in front of the tv (we'll have to change this last one soon!).  He will even wait to pee when we are out so he can use his &#34;small potty&#34; at home instead of public toilets.We like it because he uses it, it is easy to clean with the white part coming right out of the chair, and the splash guard is great for the boys.  There's a smaller version of this chair without the back that we take with us when we are out or on vacation too.
I love this potty.  Because it only has two pieces to it, its easy to clean.  The high pee-guard means no need to supervise when my son is using it. We don't ever have any splashing incidents.  Like most stand alone potties, it is very small and low to the ground so I don't anticipate being able to use it for much longer.
My son was so excited when he seen his big boy potty! This has made training so much fun for him. I love that it's simple without all the bells and whistles (distractions!) and looks like an actual mini toilet. The gaurd on this is higher than most which is also great for boys to prevent spraying everywhere. Simple to clean too.
I wanted a small potty chair that would be easy for our 18 month old to sit on. We didn't pressure her to use it, but would casually ask. She would run in and sit on it, read on it, and sing songs. Fast forward to when she is 22 months and she now asks to go potty and will actually use it for that purpose!  Still in the potty training process, but this is a great starter tool.  I specifically got the white with splash guard so that it was the same color as the adult toilet in all the bathrooms and also so we could see if she went.
This is great, partly because it's low-profile and doesn't take up much space, and also (best of all) because it's SO easy to clean!  The plastic seems super-slippery so all potty messes slide off OR are easily wiped away with cleaning solution.  Even the white doesn't discolor over time.  The slight rubber bottom keeps it sticking to tile, so that's convenient.  I would definitely recommend this to any and all looking for a small, simple quality training toilet.  For boys, the pee guard lip works pretty well.
We love that this seat makes it comfortable for our little boy compared with the wider conversion style potty chairs (the ones that turn into step stools) because the back is higher and it has arm rests.  Another great perk is that it takes up significantly less space.  Makes it easier to keep it conveniently located for your toddler.  Also, despite its 'lack' of bell and whistles it is easy to clean and safe.  The no skid rubber bottom is an excellent feature!  Highly recommend this potty chair!
This is a really nice potty chair, I like the high back since my toddler is special needs and has trouble sitting up, this gives her a little extra support in the back.  The color is cute.  Really just your basic potty chair, no bells or whistles, but that fits our needs.  Four stars.
I have two different pottys. This is my granddaughters favorite. It is very easy to empty and clean. I love it.
Nice looking potty, white insert is removable for easy cleaning. Cute color, yellow lining on bottom of potty. And is BPA free!!!
I keep this potty as a spare in our master bath (we have other potty seats by Bjorn). My son loves this potty, and so do I. The simple design makes it easy to clean and use. Ive learned my lesson with the cheaper potties made of thin plastic. I returned every one of them and purchased all Bjorn products. I love how sturdy their designs are.
Like this chair. It's small, convenient and gets the job done. The back rest really helps the baby. Would certainly recommend to others.
My daughter loves this potty. She is 17 months and we are just starting to introduce her to the potty. It is sturdy and bright. She can sit in it for a while, even if sometimes she doesn't do anything in it :-) I just wish it had a lid, it would make it a little easier to keep her from throwing toys into it.
My daughter loves this potty. She actually thinks using it is fun. My wife and I have bought a few other potties that just didn't work that well. This one is perfect. We are so happy we bought it.
We are just now introducing the potty to my toddler; therefore, have yet to use it in its full capacity. He appears to fit great on it and it looks as it it will be easy to clean.
I was looking for a potty to use for baby potty training, he's 6 months old and in the 25th precentile. I saw that some people commented that it was small, which is what i was actually looking for, and it works great for us. The back is great, he can sit on quite comfortably, so long as I entertain him!He has used successfully, and it's really easy to empty. I just add some water if needed and flush it, the seat just lifts out.There is an imprint on his bum after he gets up, but he doesn't seem to mind.Here's a tip: since he still pretty short and his feel don't reach the floor, I use something to put his feet on for leverage, and it really helps. The baby wipes container is perfect.
I purchased these in the hopes they would work for our newborn.  Unfortunately, I haven't even given birth yet and I already know they're not going to hold up to the demands of a newborn wetting even once in them.The pros: inexpensive.The cons: These diapers are horribly rough, even after a washing.  The fabric is fraying and even triple folded, these things do not hold liquid.  Since I'd already washed them I figured I could at least use them for dish towels, but they merely move the water around on whatever surface you're trying to dry, they don't absorb.Save your money and skip these...and buy a higher quality cloth diaper.
Whether you are using these diapers for diapering or for burp cloths, I suggest you look at the version with the padded absorbent center. This version is too thin to serve as either a burp cloth or for diapering. However, the same brand, with the absorbent center pad, is much better.
These for cloth diapering?  Um, no way.  Way too thin for that.  These for burp cloths?  Absolutely!  While I still periodically reach for the pretty and colorful burp cloths that are specifically made for that use, they are not nearly as absorbent as these Gerber cloth diapers.  My child is not even all that prone to throwing up and the other burp cloths are still not enough... I cannot imagine how often you would have to reach for a 2nd, 3rd and 4th burp cloth if you had a baby who spit up all the time.  These are easily washed and inexpensive... admittedly not as pretty, but most mothers get over "pretty" real quick when real life sets in and baby becomes messy all of the time! lol
Love these! Absorbent, soft, inexpensive, held up well after many MANY washes, no stains, ect.  My only complaint is that they shrink quite a bit.My daughter has always hated wearing disposable diapers.  When she was a newborn, she'd holler whenever we tried to put one on her.  As she got older, she'd arch her back, scream, and try to get away as we were putting the diaper on her.  So when she was a newborn, I used these flat folds wrapped oragami style (no plastic cover, although you could use one) to give her a break from her disposable diaper.  We've actually made the switch to cloth diapering full time.  Now I use these as a cloth insert for the gdiaper (fold in fourths, then half) and Thirsties (fold in thirds, then half).  You could also easily use these to stuff pocket diapers.
I disagree with whoever said that these are too thin for burp cloths.  They do look gauzy, but fold them over once, and they're thick enough to absorb most of my baby's spit-ups entirely, and (apologies if this gets graphic) even a single layer is effective at catching all the chunky bits in spit-up which can cause your clothes to smell.  I fear that the prefolds would be too bulky for me and not nearly broad enough.  I like the simple, large form of these diapers.I use these predominantly as burp clothes.  They are so absorbent, so effective, so economical, and so handy.  I have three packs, and I really needed them all when my baby was a newborn.  I keep a tall stack on my coffee table, and I'm always ready for errant bodily fluids.I also occasionally use these to wipe up all manner of spills.  They're extremely effective at drying dishes and wiping down counter tops.  In a pinch, they make great handkerchiefs for my runny nose when I'm out for a walk with the stroller.  I also fold them and put them in my baby's (all-in-one-cloth) diaper if I want to give it a bit more absorbing power.  Tuck one in the car-seat, another in your pocket, and lay one under your baby's head when she goes down for a nap.  They don't take up much room in the laundry, so you might as well use them liberally and keep the rest of your life clean and dry!
I just received these as a gift and will be returning them. I had intended to use them as burp cloths, but they are way too thin and not absorbent at all! You can see right through them. Plus, the fabric is really scratchy. Not at all what I was expecting.
Love that these are cotton - texture is great and they are actually much softer than they look. We don't actually use these for diapers.  I bought them as "temporary burp cloths" while deciding on some others.  I now use these exclusively.  One thing I love about them is that they wash very well - I don't spray them with any stain remover and they come out clean every time simply using Dreft detergent.We also use them to "catch" my little boys' geyser, as my husband refers to it, during diaper changes.  I think these would also be great for household cleaning as well (I'd use separate ones for those).  These also make a great light-weight, breathable blanket for blocking the sun - we live in Texas, so this is a huge plus!
I just want to start of saying that I had purchased these with the intent of cloth diapering my baby.  I had used Gerber flatfolds and prefolds on my first two children back in 2000 and 2002.  They were amazingly awesome back in the day, so I'm wondering what on earth happened.These are very thin . . . I mean see through thin.  I couldn't even use them as a changing, shoulder or lap pad in a pinch. Any baby "mishap" would immediately seep through.  Not only that, they feel very rough - not something you'd want to rub on a newborn baby's skin to clean spit-up or drool.I feel bad for giving such a poor review because I'm normally a huge fan of Gerber products.  I just think that these are pointless and a waste of money.  You can find better flatfolds for nearly the same price as these.  As far as burp cloths, the Gerber prefold diapers work awesome for those.
It may be telling that I've never had old Gerber flats.  Maybe if I had 20 or 30 year old diapers to compare these to, I'd give them a much lower rating.  But I don't.These are absolutely the cheapest way to cloth diaper a baby if you want to buy new diapers.  They're an ultra-basic birdseye cotton.  MANY modern cotton flats are birdseye.  They do indeed appear thin. BUT after a few washes, they are super-soft.  I really cannot over-talk how wonderfully soft they are.  They're a very close second to the flannel receiving blankets I also use as diapers.For comparison, I bought some OsoCozy flats, also sold here on Amazon, back in January.  Those flats are visibly thicker.  After I prepped the OsoCozy diapers, I did a head-to-head comparison.  I put my daughter in an origami-folded Gerber flat, pinned, and kept her coverless until she peed. Then I did the same with the OsoCozy flats--same fold, same pinning, etc and kept her coverless until she peed.  End result?  These are JUST AS GOOD as the more expensive diapers.So, why am I not giving them five stars?  One reason only: size.  Flat diapers are supposed to last your baby from the newborn stage through toilet training.  These really won't.  For all that the product description says they're 27x27, they're not, at least not after being washed.  They are very rectangular after prepping, and pretty small.Their small size makes them PERFECT newborn diapers, though.  Even if most of your stash is all-in-one diapers, you would do well to buy a couple dozen of these for the first couple of months, especially if you tend to have smallish babies (one-size diapers don't usually fit below 8lbs).  They work perfectly for small babies--yes, they even contain breastfed poop!--and once your babe has outgrown their intended use, they are FANTASTIC for stuffing pockets, lining gDiapers (this is my usual use for them these days), and using as doublers for fitted diapers or overnight diapers.
i use this to store breastmilk so my husband can feed the baby.  i also use the bottles to freeze breastmilk.  its great because its compatible for the medela pump but my baby isnt that fond of the nipples.  i end up using the avent for feeding and transfer the milk from the medela.  buy this if you are planning on storing a lot of milk.  otherwise you are better off with avent or gerber new traditions.
I use these to pump & store my milk with the Medela Harmony pump. Each bottle is the perfect amount for 1-2 feedings for my 6-week old baby. But the nipples are worthless---not shaped like me in the least (and probably like no one!)--my husband tried them once while I was away (when we first bought them) and she hated them. Instead we pour the milk into a Playtex drop-ins system bottle with the big slow-flow nipple.
I have not had a problem with using these bottles on my older model of the medela pump. Very helpful to have extras!
I was very disappointed in this product. It was highly recommended by the hospital, so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born. After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks, I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple. We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those, either. We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium. She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those. Now she's a pro! (Anyone need my Medela set????)
This is a must have for working moms who have the medela pumps.  The extra bottles come in handy for transporting milk to daycare and for expressing milk on the job.  Wouldn't live without the extra set.
These bottles are useful for storing milk....they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely.  My baby hates them for feeding, however.  I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles.  I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby...and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast.  Um, no.  Take one look at them and it's pretty clear.  My baby wouldn't even take it in her mouth.  She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples, however.  Much, much better!
These bottles are great but are very pricey.  I have a 2 month old and I was producing more more milk than he was drinking allowing me to store some in the freezer.  I was hesitant to use the bags because I was afraid they would leak so I found myself wanting to buy more bottles, but for $18.99 for 6, I needed to find another alternative.  I did some research and found bottles made my Mother's Milkmate (mothersmilkmate.com or on ebay) These bottles are compatible with the Madela breast pump and nipple rings.  The refrigerator storage system is great too, you have to check out the website to understand what I mean.  If you love these bottles, you've love the milkmate ones as well.Hope this helps and saves you money!
I got the Medela bottles because I intended on breast feeding my child. Unfortunatly I was unable to do that. But these bottles work wonderfully with formula!My daughter retains much less air with the Medela nipples and she seems to prefer the shape as well. I found that when I sterilize Gerber nipples they become "gummy" and "sticky", but the Medela brand holds up very well in our sterilizer.I think the Medela bottles stand the test of time, which ends up saving you money in the long run and my baby LOVES them!
I use the pump-in-style advanced breastpump, and I really like that these bottles screw right into the pump assembly.  I like having many bottles on hand so that I don't need to wash them every day.  I don't freeze my milk in these (I use Gerber bags), but they're great for temporary storage until pouring into the feeding bottles.  I use Avent bottles as my baby seems to like the shape and flow of the newborn nipples (these nipples seem too fast-flowing).
Don't bother with these.  They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary.  It is much easier to buy storage bags.  If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic.They also flow too fast for newborns.
I use this for my portable changing pad and under the sheet in my daughters cradle. It is a bit wide for my cradle, so I just tuck in the sides.  It is wide for the portable changing pad, but still works good!
This pad is great to place under your sheets in parent's bed where mom sleeps and nurses. Just the right size to shield mattress from excess breastmilk!
I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition to the mattress pad.  I have about 4 of them and they are essential.  I use John Lennon receiving blankets (6 is a good number) with the quilted multi-use pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad. I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on. It's nearly impossible to do when you've had a c-section, and not a good idea to strain yourself.
This product seems great.  You can use it for every purpose which involves your baby.  We have them in different sizes for the Crib, bassinett, playard, and just extra changing pads for middle of the night changes and carry around pad.  They absorb great and wash with no problems.  I tumble dry low, that way they keep their shape longer.  Take them everywhere and dont have to worry about laying your little one on hard cold surfaces when diaper changing.  Very affordable and worth every penny.  I highly recommend to every parent.
I use this and the smaller ones all the time.  I have this in the crib as a mattress pad, I put it on the changing table over the cover for an extra barrier.  I use the smaller ones when traveling to lay down to change my child in public areas (those koala tables)  They are durable and easy to clean.  Everyone should have a few of these.
I used this to protect the Pack N Play and crib mattresses, which proved very effective. However, as a regular changing pad, it spends more time in the bleach bucket than in the nursery!  Regular burp cloths are softer on Baby's face and less bulky.  The only reason I can think to use the quarter sized sheets is for the annual visit with Santa.  Santa might appreciate that!
I use this pad on top of my son's mattress as well as the smaller sizes for his playard bassinet and the changing table. They may not be the softest on the market but they work very well. For the price, you can afford to buy several so that you don't have to do laundry as often. The only thing I didn't like about these pads is they seem to shrink a bit when put into the dryer. My advice is to line dry them to avoid this problem.
Of all of my baby purchases, these have been used the most!  I have three that I keep around--one for the diaper bag, one for the bedroom, and one for the laundry--and I don't know what I would do without them.  Since my baby is only 6 weeks old, I keep him in the bedroom with me at night.  I just throw one of these on the bed when I'm changing him at night so I don't have to walk across the house to his room to use the changing table.  It is water resistant (and everything baby can "spill" on it resistant) and it is large enough so that if my little guy starts to go to the bathroom while I am changing his diaper, it gets on this pad instead of the bed.  The one in the diaper bag is also very useful--much more practical than the plastic covered changing pads that come with diaper bags.  Because this is much larger, and absorbant, I just throw it out on the seat of the car, or on the public restroom changing table, or on the floor, or wherever I need to change him, and it covers a nice large area--I don't have to worry about him touching any dirty surfaces.  I will buy these for all of my frieds having babies--I recommed getting at least 3 or 4 of them to keep around!
These pads are soft and absorbent - just the right size to put on a cradle.  The smaller size is perfect for laying on top of a changing table.  They wash well and I haven't noticed shrinkage.  Good value and worth having a couple of different sizes on hand.
This pad is perfect for our playard. I put it under the sheet and I have no worries about trying to clean the matress board since the material cannot come off. It is very soft, provides an extra layer of padding since playards are so hard, and it can be washed and dried in the machines no problem. Even when we go on vacation we pack it up with the playard. Great investment for your babies saftey, babies confort, your sanity (when trying to wash the playard matress), and what makes this even better is the price!!!!
We've tried a lot of different sipper cups, but these are our absolute favorites!  We've been using them for 17 years.  The valves are easy to remove and to clean, unlike other brands that grow mold inside a valve you can't really clean out.  They don't leak unless banged upside down onto a table or floor, and the valves are easily replaced once they start to wear out.Unfortunately, it's getting hard to find this particular style of the playtex cups.  Since they last a very long time, we've replaced valves and are using some very old ones.  We've even replaced lids once upon a time.I ordered one set of these recently, hoping they'd be boy-colored for my new one year old.  Unfortunately, we received pink and purple flowered ones.  My 3 year old was thrilled and the 1 year old doesn't really care at the moment.  I'm not sure if there's a way to request a boy-theme or not, but we'll probably order again sometime soon and take our chances.
I'm a huge fan of Playtex sippies.  I've tried many brands and these are the sturdiest and leak the least amount then anything we've tried.  We have 3 children using sippies and so they get a lot of wear and tear on them.  They last us for years.  This was a great price and I couldn't get it this cheap in the store.  I like the insulated ones better but for the price these were worth it.
These cups don't spill, but the liquid comes out too fast for my daughter.  She's 8 months and still on stage 1 nipples because she chokes easily, so that's not the cups fault.  She was drinking water from these yesterday and had it running all down her chin then choked a little.  So if your baby is fine with a faster flow... go for it!  I'm hoping to use these once she's a little older since they really don't leak at all.  She kept holding it upside down and tossing it and nothing came out!
We've been using these cups since my son was around 8 months.  He had another sippy with a silicon tip and handles at first, but we wanted to introduce a cup that he could use for many years to come.  This is it!  Cups with silicone tips WILL leak if they get bent.  I can throw this cup in the diaper bag and not worry that it's going to leak.  It hasn't leaked once.  I love that this cup will fit in most cup holders.  It's super easy to clean with it's THREE parts.  You can use them as regular drinking cups for older kids.
does not leak,relatively easy to clean,nothing to chew trough (it is amazing that a replacement part for a soft spout may cost as much as a new sippy)and yes, the bottle is finally gone!
the last set that I bought was the wrong colors but I used them anyhow...they wash good and last long.
We have been through soooooooo many sippy cups.  My kids only like these. They don't leak and they stand up to a million dishwasher cycles.  I should probably take apart the top pieces every once and awhile ... but I don't.
I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 1 1/2 year old and have had my fare share of sippy cups to use clean sometimes throw many away. I use to think that using the soft sippy cups  was a great transition from bottles..NOT!! these are the best they are easy to clean they dont leak everywhere and they hold the perfect amount of liquid. I have found that children with teeth chew on the soft tip and it is no longer leek proof which makes night time a big pain, anyways these are awsome and i defiantly recommend them. I got the purple and pink one since they very but i didnt mind its not like having a pink sippy cup makes my son gay or anything so people are so silly
I like these cups a lot.  I love the colors.  They are easy to use and easy to wash. My toddler loves them.  I haven't had any issues with the cups leaking and I have been using them for 6 months. They seem sturdy even after I have been washing them in the dishwasher since day one. Great value too!
Yes they leak, I mean POUR milk from under the sealing ring.  Don't waste your money.  If you are crazy enough to buy them SAVE YOUR RECEIPT!
If you are using Avent bottles, these storage containers are a must. Very convenient and versatile (use as bottles, sippy cups, storing breastmilk, babyfood), easy to clean. Nice size to take to work or anywhere. You can use these with the Medela Pump in Style breast pump, but you need to buy an adaptor from Avent.
I love these breastmilk storage containers.  They make it so easy to collect the milk, cap it, and store it.  When I need the milk, I just take them out of the freezer, heat it in the bottle heater, put on a nipple and go.  They are great.  Perfect size for my baby who still only drinks about 3-4 ounces per sitting.  I will definitely continue to use these after she outgrows them for milk as baby food containers.  They are great.
I love this containers.  First of all, I am a big fan of the Isis Breast Pump, so these containers are perfect for me.  I express into these containers--freeze them--thaw them out--replace the sealing disc with the nipple--warm it up.  Then my husband is ready to feed the baby.  It's one of their times together, and I get to spend time with my older children.  Perfect.
I use these storage containers for mixing breast milk and rice cereal to feed my daughter while we are out.  I love these containers for this use.  I don't have any problem with leaking and I can feed my daughter straight out of the jar.I gave these 4 stars because I didn't get any use out of these for storing breastmilk in the freezer (which is why I registered for them in the first place).  It takes FOREVER to defrost the breastmilk in these bottles.  I just ended up using the Lansinoh and Gerber milk storage bags because they defrosted quickly and took up much less room in the freezer.
These are great. They don't leak and are nice and sturdy. The tops come off and nipple tops can be directly attached. After he stopped with these bottles, I used them since they had flat closed tops, to shake up his formula. I love Avent products and these are wonderful.They attach to the bottom of the Avent VIA Isis pump directly which was nice. Great for storage of baby food later on as well. Tops can be used with 9ounce bottles as well.
We used the infant bath tub initially but by the time my daughter turned 2 months we started using this inflatable tub. I put it in the tub and though my daughter doesn't sit up yet, she has plenty of room to move her legs and arms while I hold her. Yes, it is more strenuous for my back but it's good fun and exercise for my baby. Also, we don't have much room in my bathroom so we put up two extension rods (like those you use to hang a shower curtain) above the tub and store it on them. This keeps it out of the way though the tub does have a suction cup which works.I can't wait till my baby sits up - I envision putting the Snug Tub out on the porch for her to play in. O, by the way, I haven't reinflated it once since I bought it (about 2 months ago or so)- yes, some of the air escaped, as with all inflatables, but it's still sturdy enough. I also sometimes put a blanket in it and let my daughter 'sit' in it and play with her toys. I find it very versatile.
My almost 1 year old grew out of the hard plastic-type infant/baby tub so looked for one that was softer and bigger. This one works great. Like the dain plug and the suction cup to keep it from sliding in the tub.
I bought this because my baby wasn't old enough to sit up yet but was getting way too big for her plastic tub. This works great! You don't have to worry about them slipping in a big tub and it saves water! She is now able to sit on her own and she really enjoys splashing around in this. I love how much safer it is and its big enough for her to use for a couple of years.
This is perfect for my 15 month baby whose 32 inches long, 26 lbs., it's well made and not slippery at all, easy to clean and the suction cup hold the tub really well.  Great purchase.
I was hoping this would be a good transition tub for my 6 month old who is growing out of the tub that fits in the sink.If you are in the same situation, I caution you with this purchase -1) It reeks like plastic and has for weeks.2) it is dangerously slippery. My son can sit up very securely, however he immediately slid. I even bought a tub mat insert to try, and he still slipped.3) It barely fits into our tub.
As soon as my (large!) baby could sit up with confidence, I switched him to this tub. He loves it!! Now he has room to splash his hands against the water, play with his bath toys and explore the duckie-print.The tub is easy to blow up, easy to hang and I've had no problems with it being slippery.Honestly - with a couple gallons of water and a 23 lb baby inside, how much can this thing move?
This tub is perfect for my 15 mo old girl, and we use it as our everyday tub and also take it when we travel.  my only complaint is that the drain sits flush against the bath floor so it doesn't really drain unless you put something underneath it to elevate it a little (I use a foam letter since we already have them in the tub for her to play with).
We used this tub for my baby from about 7 or 8 months old until about 13 months.  It was a great transition from our infant bathtub, giving her more space without using all the water that a full bath would require.  It only took moments to inflate by mouth, and I never needed to add more air.  I liked being able to use the tub in the middle of the big tub so my baby was never in close proximity to the faucet or water controls.  The vinyl is a nice quality, and I ended up using it outdoors as a small wading pool at my mother's house after the baby outgrew it for bath purposes.  Once she started walking it was not long that she learned how to climb out of the sides, but I'm very happy with the job that this tub did for the months we were able to use it!
My son outgrew his infant tub so I tried to bath him in a regular tub - wasn't having it!  So I needed something fast that could act as a transition tub.  This fit the bill.  I would recommend buying a hand pump to fill it (just be very careful).  I tried to blow it myself and nearly passed out!  I used the pump from my exercise ball and it was inflated and ready to go in minutes.  Just place the plug in the hole and fill!  I am not sure why people have complained about it being slipper - my son stands up just fan when I have to wash his bottom.  He loves it!  My only complaint is that the bottom leaves...um...rear end stains so make sure you keep it clean or at least pre-clean your babies bottom before putting them in.  I always do so I don't know how it stains but it does!
was looking for a solution for my infant when he outgrew the baby tub (he was too long for it and his feet were hanging out). This tub is the perfect solution. My baby loves it. I started using it around 4 months when he could lean against it, and now that he can sit and move around more it still is the perfect bath solution. Love that it has a suction on it too to hang up.
I'm very satisfied with this affordable blow up tub.  The bottom part under the baby's butt blows up separately than the sides, which is nice because my 6 month old was unstable sitting on the blown up bottom at first.  She loves the ability to play in the water in here, I just have a hard time keeping her sitting in the tub, she keeps wanting to stand up and climb the bathtub walls. I think that's more an issue with my very active daughter than the tub though :)
Good little tub. Fits just fine in our American Standard regular tub. Little man sometimes pulls the drain plug, so make sure that it is pushed all the way down. The tub is slightly wedge shaped, to help "lock it in" to your tub. We have been using it for 5 months with no problems, little man is now 1 year.
We had the Fisher Price whale tub for my baby, and as she started to get bigger and we removed the middle ledge in the tub she'd often slide down towards the water.  Also, splashing got to be a bit messy on the counter top.  I purchased this, and have used it for a few months - it's perfect!  I've had to add some air to it once, but other than that I just rinse it out after each use.  My 9 month old does not slip around in it at all.  She likes to either lean back or sit in the middle and play.  I wish we had started using it earlier. It's so nice not to have to fill up a whole bathtub with water, just for a tiny baby, too.UPDATE - My baby is now 16 months old, and we still LOVE this tub, even though she's in the 97% for height and 90% for weight.  Unfortunately, it has developed a slow leak.  We got 10 months hard, abusing, biting on the tub use out of it, which is amazing for such a reasonably priced product.  I only refilled the air once in 10 months - the rest of the time it stayed full.  We have been VERY happy with this!
My baby boy loved this toy so much it kept him intrigued and I would recommend it babies mine is now 18 months and this is well worth the investment
This is a nice enough tub but nothing special enough to warrant five stars.  I like the Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub better than this one because it is deeper and the bottom plug is cushioned better the SnugTub's.  The SnugTub is slightly longer, though, and that was a key issue.  Why doesn't someone invent a larger toddler tub?  We're trying to postpone having to waste a lot of water filling the entire adult bathtub for our growing toddler's baths.  A vinyl tub that is 9 or 10 inches high and 30 inches long would be perfect and sell well.  There must be lots of other parents looking for a similar transitional tub!
I bought this wedge as my stomach started getting bigger to find some comfort sleeping at night. The wedge is very stiff, even after working it for a little while. The angle of it isn't right..it should be thicker at it's current thinnest part, because basically, my belly just pushes into it, and it falls on the floor, eventually. It was a waste of money, and a rolled up blanket or pillow does the job way better, and they are way more comfortable!
It is a small pillow, most useful underneath another pillow to give you a little elevation. It's really too uncomfortable to lay directly on it, maybe if you just wanted to put it between your legs it'd be okay. I don't think I'd call this a "pregnancy pillow" - it's too small. My wife needed full upper body elevation and a pillow 1/4 the size of her back (and only 4" tall) isn't going to help. However this worked good for just head elevation (with another pillow on top).
I bought this pillow on a whim not having much faith since it was only $9.99.  It was the best money ever spent!  I have always been a left-side sleeper so I didn't think sleeping while pregnant would be difficult.  By my 5th month I my would wake up with my hips aching.  Just wedging the pillow under my side would make all the difference in the world.
So tiny and hard as a rock.  Inexpensive, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Not even using. Makes me more uncomfortable.
I had two of these.  One on each side of me every night I went to sleep, when I was pregnant.  I didn't like the HUGE pregnancy pillows that take most of your bed and force your husband to sleep on the couch! So, these were perfect!!  Easily adjustable and secure.  I am keeping them for my next pregnancy! :)
This wedge is very small, it will work well for supporting a pregnant belly but is not for sleeping on.  I was disappointed that it was so small and firm.
I got this pillow and when it arrived I was disappointed. I purchased it intending to use it to prop my torso up at night during my 2 trimester. It was much smaller than I realized and tossed it aside. A few weeks later I started using it between my knees while I slept on my side. I also used it under my growing belly so It wouldn't hang. I found myself using it behind my back during TV time and also in the car. I used it all the time. Right now, I am letting a friend borrow it for her back at work since she is in her third trimester. I would recommend this pillow to anyone so has back issues or is pregnant. The case comes off so you can clean it too.
This pillow is smaller than a standard sized bed pillow.  It is just enough to wedge under my hip & keep me off of my vena cava (now 7 months along.)  It does not solve all of my comfort issues, but it gives me peace of mind that I'm not laying flat while I sleep (which I find myself doing without it.)  It seems like it will fit perfectly in my bassinet after the baby is here to elevate her head.  And when I'm done using it for that, it will make a perfect knee-separator pillow.  I have already gotten my $10 worth & forsee using it for a long time to come.
A decent pillow, wife is expecting and is in her 6th month, and this was perfect gift to her for a good night sleep.
We use this headrest for their bouncy seats only. I don't use it in their car seats because the smaller part of the head rest only fit their heads for a few weeks and the bigger part is to big for them now.
I am not rating this very highly because my daughter's head still flopped around quite a lot when I used it because babies' car seats have them sitting almost upright even as newborns.  This didn't help her head from going side to side or even forward.  Also, my car seat came with one.
I love this product.  It holds my son's head up straight and let's him sleep without his head flopping everywhere.  I have the Chambray color but it's still the same product.  I suggest having 2 on hand.  1 in the carseat and 1 in a swing or bouncer.  Also, if baby spits up on 1, then you have another to use while you are washing the first one.
This item seems like a good idea, but after purchasing two I feel that we've fallen victim to "new parent baby marketing". Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it. She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved. I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?) She would just shake it around, bang it, or throw it. Also, it's a total pain to clean it. The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.Save your money on this one.
This is great! I was able to give my child many different types of foods and not worry about him choking. He loved that he could hold it himself and eat. I would not live without this tool. This is my standard baby shower gift now and have recieved many thanks for it. Wonderful. I can't say enough good things about it.
What a great way to introduce baby to fresh fruit &amp; veggies. No choking! I admit the older style bags were hard to clean (Oxy clean and an overnight soak in hot water in a cup before a top-rack dishwasher run did get it clean, but was messy and took extra time).Now, new easy-clean/disposable bags are here! Look for them out there--our BRU had them recently. Pitch them if they're really bad, but just unscrew bag from ring, scrub or soak both and voila, put back together and re-use. Then throw them away as the bags age, tear or stain.Alex has used ours since 4 months of age and our original bags plus newer replacements are still going strong at 10 months, with repeated dishwasher-ing.
I received this as a shower gift from my sister-in-law.  When I received it, I had NO idea what is was or what it was for.  Needless to say, my perception of this has significantly changed (for the BETTER!) I use this for my 7 1/2 month old son with canned pears, pieces of apple and canned peaches...Just cut up the canned fruits/veggies to fit in the bag, and let your little one have at it! Better yet, when they're teething, freeze cubes of juice, and put the cube(s) in the bag--they'll thank you for it! They'll throughly enjoy feeding themselves (albeit making a mess too)...but more importantly, they are LEARNING to feed themselves as well as about the textures and consistencies of food other than the pureed versions they're so used to.  It's durable and EASY to clean, and replacment "bags" are found pretty much any child store.
I didn't find it too dificult to clean as others commented. It's good for babies over 6 months but one must understand that the baby might throw it away (sometimes very far away) and then all the food is gone. It's a cheap item and the baby might have fun as mine did. When they get a bit older and holding things for longer, it is very handy to leave the baby busy eating some fruit, for example.
When my 5-month-old started teething, my father-in-law tried to put crushed ice in a Zip-loc bag so she'd have something to chomp on (she wasn't a fan of chilled teethers). We started using cold fruit to soothe her gums, but even without teeth she managed to break of chunks and I'd have to pry open her mouth to fish out the pieces. This simple little plastic and mesh device has worked very well for us. At first we used to fill it with crushed ice, but then started putting fruits or veggies in (as mentioned on the packaging) and it works great for that as well. We even take it with us to restaurants so she can chew on pieces of fruit. I like that she can hold onto it herself and I don't have to worry about her choking (there's no way she could fit anything but the tip of the mesh in her mouth). I have had such good luck with this product that I'm already stocking up on them to give to girlfriends as shower gifts.
Some swear by this, but my child hated it. He is sensitive to food textures, so he didn't take to the bag at all.
Wouldn't it be nice if the fears of solid feeding could be alleviated?  How much would you pay to have some safeguard against your little one choking as they learn to eat new foods?  Wouldn't it be nice if there were something better than those refrigeratable rings to sooth sore, teething gums?  Now there is!After having a small choking incident, which I was able to react quickly to, I bought this to relieve some of my fears.  I had heard good things about this product but this is something you HAVE to experience for yourself.I found it so nice to be able to offer my daughter bananas, grapes, potatoes, and so much more without having to worry about her taking in to big of a piece and choking.  With the baby safe feeder, your child knaws or sucks on the mesh and the food is dispensed in small quantities that are safe to be swalled by little mouths.I loved this item even more when teething time came around.  I could drop one or two ice cubes in the bag and my daughter would be on cloud nine.  She never cared for those teething rings or other teething toys, this was it for us.  She would hold onto the handle and suck cube uppon cube of ice until her pains were relieved.I think every parent should own one of these, it is inexpensive and well worth the money.
I was afraid that my baby would throw/drop this and break the ring, but then I discovered that I could link the handle to the attachment on the Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Highchair.  It works great!
I think this is a great idea. I only used it a couple times for foods. At that time she was having trouble mastering how to hold the handle and soon after that she was able to pick up foods on her own and was pretty good at chewing. I LOVE this product for when she is teething. I put a couple ice cubes in it and wet it under the faucet so it doesn't stick to her lips. She gets upset when the ice is gone. My daughter is 11 months and has been teething almost none stop since 3 months...Currently she is cutting her first molars and this helps for her to suck on it and get the cold water back farther than a teething ring would.
I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion.  I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me.  Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!
I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag.
I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them.  If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up.  Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean.  Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better.
I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump.  I really didn't like using them with the twist ties.  That didn't make sense to me at all.  I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better.  They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup!I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles.
I do not like these bags.  The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.  The bags are small.  The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.  The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly.
We were using bottles to store milk when my mother bought these. I was SOOO skeptical at first, but I tried them. LOVE EM!!! I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars b/c they are a little bit akward to put on the pumps, but I love them!!! they save space and they are less expensive than buying 50 bottles to store your milk in.
After using both these bags and the Gerber bags, I prefer the zipper-style closure of the Gerber bags.  I've never had a problem with those leaking or ruining my milk.  They are also much cheaper as you can generally find them at discount stores (Target, etc.).
I love this gadget.  I bought two extra bases for my infant car seat for both my husband's and my mother's car.  Unlike my car, there center seat has a harness strap.  Those are hard to get really tight.  My center seat has just the lap belt and it was easy to secure the base.  With the harness strap it was just too hard to get the seat in tight enough.  With the mighty tight, it was a snap.  You just hooked it in, cranked it, and voula!!!That seat isn't going anywhere.  I love it.  It is easy to use, it makes the seat secure, and it is sturdy.  You must have this if you are trying to secure a seat in a position with a shoulder harness.
Something like this is a great idea, but when I called to ask the fire dept. to inspect my car.  They said not to add any after-market things to car seats or seat belts. The firefighter said this could weaken the seat belt over time and it may break in a crash. They also said that the headrest for the infant seat was dangerous because it adds more room between baby and the seat, which may cause the baby to be injury seriously in an accident.I took both out of my car. The mighty tite is just collecting dust.  I have no plans of using it or giving it away.  If I can't find a use for it, I'll probably throw it away.  The headrest is in the bouncer or the swing. They are great for around-the-house everyday use.
This is a great item you cannot do without! When I was pregnant a friend of ours who is a fireman, told us we must get this. He used it for his two kids & said he wouldn't do without it. We had no problems installing it in our Isuzu Rodeo or Honda Civic. I wouldn't install a baby seat without this.
I believe we can fairly judge the usefulness of this accessory in terms of "before" and  "after". We're on our second car seat now, and I've helped install others for friends, and every car seat has its own installation quirks. At some point, with all of them, if you're using seat belts to hold down the car seat, you're going to have to tighten the belt significantly. When I install our car seat (before the Mighty Tite), that means getting up on it and bearing down a lot of weight while tugging on it; when my wife does it, it means not being able to get a really tight fit at all."After" we got the Mighty Tite, and went through the use of it, I'd say our car seat installation time was reduced by 200%, and the installation job was much more secure. During a recent spate of traveling, we had to install and re-install the seat a dozen times in a two-week period, and this was utterly essential for getting on and off of the airplane quickly while still having a securely-installed seat, and even more importantly, getting the seat re-installed securely when we were putting it into a "strange" car.We particularly appreciated the plastic instructions attached to the Mighty Tite with a metal ring -- it meant when we got confused about how to use it with a different belt arrangement, we had the visual reference right at hand and not all dog-eared or ripped up (like our car seat installation manual!)Obviously, if you're only going to install the car seat once in one car there may be diminishing returns on a device like this. But if you have to move it even occasionally, I think this accessory is worth the price for a little extra security and peace of mind, plus a few extra minutes saved.The one caveat I provide is that the plastic retainers that hold the strap in have begun to look a little stressed (the way well-used plastic looks before it breaks), so this might not wear well over a multi-year period. This is not a safety issue, since this part is used only to guide the safety belt, and if it does break, it will still be usable. Still, one would hope it will not! Since we've already put it to heavy use, though, I'm well satisfied at the purchase and value.
I bought this product because I was so afraid of the seat belt not being tight enough for the infant seat base.  I have used this product since my son was just a few months old.  I loved it.  I never worried about the seat belt again.  I was in a car accident with my child when he was almost 3 years old.  I was still using this product with his forward facing car seat.  My car was totalled (I drove a Saturn)...the only part of the car without damage was the roof & the drivers side...my son's car seat was on the rear passenger side, so he recieved more of the impact than I did being the driver.  I honestly believe that this  product saved him from worse injuries than he recieved.  He came out of the wreck with only scratches on the top of his head.  Even though the Mighty-Tite makes the seat belt tight so that the car seat itself won't slide around, his car seat still fell over & that is what shielded his body & face from the glass.  I don't know how it worked out that way, but if his car seat hadn't fallen to its side, I think that he may have been hurt more.  The Mighty-Tite still worked fine after the wreck, & the seat belt never broke like some of the other reviews say.  My son is now in a booster seat & we don't use the Mighty-Tite anymore, but I am pregnant with my 2nd child, I am definately going to use this product again with this baby.
I bought this sheet because I believed everything should be &quot;form fitting&quot; if my son was to be in it - to prevent possible suffocation, choking....This sheet was so rough I could not lay my baby on it.  After washing 3-4 times with loads of fabric softener - no difference.I used it once and it's been in the closet ever since.I ended up putting a thin blanket in the packnplay and tucking it into the sides instead.  It was soft, and when my child was sleeping he didn't pull it out.If and when I use the pack and play as a playpen, I may pull the sheet out and try again.  For the basinett - don't bother.
If you are purchasing or have a pack-n-play, these extra sheets are a necessity.  Baby will spit up, drop the bottle, lose the sippy cup in the playard, and extras are much more convenient than attempting to immediately wipe down the sheet.These sheets fit well, wash well, and aren't overly padded so as to be unsafe. All in all, a reasonably priced, high quality necessity.
I bought one just to try to keep the pad a little bit more comfortable, but it is so thin.  At nine dollars I thought it would be better.
I couldn't fathom why the pack'n'play layette bed needed a sheet. The spittle and drool just wipes off, right? Not as easily as you might hope, and these sheets are just the thing to make it easier. They fit perfectly, match fine, and keep muck off the mat. Way to go, Graco - you've done it again!
I bought this sheet for a Graco brand pack and play...the sheet is fitted, just not in the traditional sense (there's no elastic) just kind of pockets sewn in the corners.  It stays on OK though.  Just one thing threw me, I thought the color "tea" would be tan or some variation of a light brown, but it is definitely green.
I bought this sheet for my Baby Trend playyard.  The sheet fits well and I've had no problems with washing it.  I do, however, put a bassinett pad (one of the big lap pads) under the sheet to help with keeping the &quot;mattress&quot; dry.  It's not the softest sheet ever made, but that's not what I was expecting.  After all, my son plays on it.
I had two of these sheets for my first child because that's all I could find at the time. Other reviewers are right on about the quality. VERY thin and not very soft either. You can see the pattern right through them.Now that we're expecting our second child any day and she'll be sleeping in the play yard for a long bit, I wanted to see what else was out there.I found the following brands at BRU, bought one of each and tried them on the bed. Here's what I found:Nojo: Terrycloth-like fabric. Soft but still a bit thin. They are elasticized though, which is easier to put on and stays on better. There were three colors available at the store (dark blue, light blue, white). Price $9.99Graco quilted sheet: Very plush, though the fabric is synthetic feeling (I didn't check, but I'd guess poly blend). Most comfortable of any that I tried. Will probably use it under a more natural feeling sheet. Elasticized and stayed on well. Was only available in a dark blue. Most expensive at $14.99Carter portable crib sheet: Knit fabric. On the thin side, but soft. Stayed on well, was elasticized and came in at least 4 colors (green, white, blue, yellow). Price $7.99Koala portable crib sheet: Listed thread count of 220 and it felt like a very decent quality. Elasticized, available in a variety of colors (pink, white, blue, green, etc) and one of the cheaper ones out there at $6.99Overall, I was VERY pleased with the options out there. Highly suggest NOT buying these, but going with an elasticized sheet. Both the Carters and Koala sheets are cheaper and are better quality.The Pack 'n Play fitted sheets will only be used as under sheets from now on!
These sheets are incredibly thin and cheap. The elastic isn't good, and the fabric is just not soft. We've bought several other brands, all of which were better than this stuff.
We couldn't get the sheet on right.  It kept lifting the corners of the floor mat.  They weren't soft like the others either.  We never used them... You can find ours at Goodwill.  Waste of money.
I love these. They are very easey to put on and take off. They wash in the washing machine, and dry in the dryer. They are small and don't take up much space to store when waiting to be used.I have four of these in three different colors. It's a bit much though. It's only necessary to have two. Ones in the wash, and ones on the pack and play. They also fit well over the quilted pack and play sheet.
We have the Travelin Tot Safari Playard and even though this sheet is made for Graco Pack n Plays, it's perfect for my son's playard also. I couldn't imagine putting him in the bassinet part without a sheet... I'm glad Graco came up with such a great product. It's best to have a few on hand for spit up's or leaky diaper's...
These reusable nursing bra pads are bulky and show through shirts.  I was very disappointed after using them the first time.  Haven't used them since and have purchased others to try.
I've tried four different products. I'm working to test each product I can get a sample of. I believe most products fit one or more specific needs. I hope my research helps you make the best choice for your needs.So far, each brand's strengths were as follows:>Kushies (3star)absorbed moisture immediately so they were the best inner doublers,>La Leche League (3star)appearance was best for use in B/C nursing bras,>Medela (2star) was easy to find in stores and absorption improved with time,>NuAngel (4star)was very affordable. "White/patterns" absorb a bit faster than "natural" so I like to put "natural" as an outer doubler and "white/patterns" as inner doubler during heavy let-downs.If you only drip a few drops during let-down any one of these brands would be fine. Read further if moderate to heavy let-downs are common.All products were machine washable, free samples, and pre-washed in hot or warm water and cold rinse at least once before use unless otherwise noted. No fabric softeners were applied as they can cause repelling. All samples were used at least a month before final opinions were noted.Categories: dry shirt test, rate of absoption, appearance, leakage, light use, heavy night use, doubler.

I have been through 4 brands of disposables and also have several pairs of these. At first when I was sore and using nipple cream, I used the disposables. The yellow cream stains, so I didn't want to mess up my good pads. After I no longer needed cream, I moved on to the washable ones. I think they are so much softer and more comfortable than the disposables. I forget that I even have them on. I agree with other posters that they may not be as discreet as some of the disposables, but I don't really care. I don't wear too many tight clothes these days and if I did I could use disposables (to me the J&J and Avent disposables are the most discreet). I don't leak much anymore, so these are plenty sufficient to collect leakage. I have four pair. I generally do laundry once a week, with one load at some point mid-week. I'm able to always have some on hand.
These are bulky under your bras and if you have heavy letdown you will leak right through. They are also difficult to wash, getting balled up and don't dry well.
These are a little to big for me (even thought I have big-uns).  They tend to get wrinkles in them and you can see them through a shirt, an under shirt, and a bra all at once.  Not my favorite.  They are, however very absorbant.
I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they've worked great. They're easy to wash and dry, I just throw them in with my regular clothes. I didn't give it 5 stars because you can't wear these with thin clothes or they show. I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way, but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show. I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use. I bought two packs and might get another one so that I don't have to wash them during the week. Why buy disposables? Seems pretty wasteful to me.
I was hoping to find a more eco way of dealing with leakage than using disposables. These work in terms of absorption for me (I should qualify that to mean I leak but generally during feedings or at night and not profusely, but enough to soak 50% of the surface of my bra at a time).Unfortunately, they are so thick they show through my more tailored clothes (flowy, patterned tops seem to remedy much of this problem). The stitching is rough and itchy. Once the pad is washed it's very ripply and won't sit flat (which is the biggest annoyance for me). They're great if you plan on being a slovenly hermit at home, but I wouldn't want to wear them in public.
I used this stool during my baby's first month. It did make breastfeeding a little more comfortable. But after the first month, it became more of a hindrance. You don't need it if you are using a nursing pillow,  like &quot;Boppy&quot;. Pricey. Better to borrow one from a friend.
I loved this so much, I bought two. I had my baby by c-section so nursing was tricky at first. I used the stool in the hospital and loved it, so bought one for home, and then two. Perfect height to get those knees up so you're not hunched while nursing. When baby weaned, I kept this for use under my desk in the office. My back problems are almost non-existent now.
I so regret not buying this sooner. My back and feet felt SO much better after using this stool. Highly recommend.
Yes, it seems a bit ridiculous to buy a nursing stool, but I got one after I used it in a nursing supply store and it totally changed how comfortable I was! Love it!
The Medela Nursing stool has been a lifesaver. It comes in handy when trying to prop baby at the right angle. Which also means this is not just a handy item for nursing, but also for bottlefeeding too! I wish I had invested in this item with my first child, would have saved me from some aches and pains. I was lucky to get this item on clearance at another baby retail store for $9.90. Great bargain and money is well spent on a terrific and useful stool.
This seems like a silly purchase and pricey for a simple stool. But it was so necessary for trying to get a good latch with a newborn. I wish I would have had this at the beginning but only discovered it in a nursing room at a baby store. If you're planning to breastfeeding or having trouble with latching, this is a must.
Icouldn't have nrsed without it.  Even my mother-in-law stated, "wow, this really works" as she was rocking her granddaughter to sleep. a bit of a pain when you are vacuuming, one more thing to move, but, otherwise, a great idea.
I didn't have it when I started, but I really appreciated it once I got it. A definate improvement. The only part that I don't like, and this is an individual thing, is the ridges (tread). I am usually bare foot and they irritate my apparently sensative feet. I've put a dish towel over it to make it more comfortable for me.
Learned of this wonderful invention from a prenatal class.  I recommend it to all my pregnant friends as it makes nursing for long periods of time comfortable and you can use any chair in the house, you don't have to necessarily sit in a fancy glider once you have this versatile stool.
I wish I'd had this when I was pregnant.  But I have it now and it has come in very handy.  I don't use it all the time but it's very comfortable when I do.  I use it a lot more with our glider when I'm pumping or just rocking the baby.  I wouldn't buy it until you see if you need it.
Once you have this stool, you will use it long after you stop nursing. It is wonderful for just propping your feet up while reading, watching TV, doing needlework, and much more. I have a rocker/glider that I use in my front room and the gliding ottoman is just awkward and bulky. I was using a regular child's step stool but have had to tip it onto two legs and I'm starting to notice some wear on my carpet. It is also easier to pick up and move out of the way than the ottomans or switch to the couch.
This stool is a miracle worker for tired legs and backs.  I love to use it when nursing my son upstairs.  The slanted top means your feet are positioned perfectly for holding a baby.  It's very sturdy and doesn't slide around on the floor like my daughter's plastic stools do.I did not get this until baby #2, and I wish I had had it with the first one!  Believe me, there is no comparison between rocking/nursing/holding a baby with this stool, or just resting your feet on the floor.Definitely in my "top ten" list of must-haves for breastfeeding.
I decided against a glider/rocker for nursing and went with a stationary chair. I went about a week of nursing with my feet flat on the ground when I realized my back being achey from the position. This stool was recommended to me at the hospital's breastfeeding class and I used it at the hospital while nursing but thought it was just an extra thing to have. Boy was I wrong. The nursing stool angles your lap up drawing baby closer to you, which allows you to have your back straighter instead of hunching towards the baby. If you find yourself stuffing an extra pillow/blanket under your nursing pillow to fill in the gap between the pillow and your lap this stool will solve that problem, and won't fall out of your lap onto the floor! The stool was easy to assemble and nice solid wood. I have been using mine for two months with no problems. The hospital had this exact nursing stool too and you could tell it was really worn in and old, but still held up perfectly. The nice thing is when you are done nursing the stool is still practical to use as a foot rest for chairs around the house- including a nice under the desk foot rest while you are on the computer.
These are great if you have an infant who learned to stand up in their crib and decided it was time to sharpen their new teeth on the rails (which I think almost every infant is!). in other words these are a must. I have only 1 problem with these (hnce 4 stars). no mater how you try to group them, they do not cover the entire rail on any side of my baby's crib (standard size). At least 2 inches on each side are still left bare for her to chew on. The company should change their length in order to be able to provide complete coverage at elast for standard crib sizes.
My 13 month old immediately pulled off the covers and started playing with them.  She loved them and thought they were a cool new toy but they did not do the intended job.  They pull off very easily even though they were a perfect fit on the rail.
I almost didn't get these after reading the reviews, but they sounded like exactly what I wanted so after making sure the measurements were right I decided to give them a shot.  They are perfect.  They fit our crib perfectly, our girls don't even really notice they are there and they stay on great.  Very pleased with these.
If you have an Oeuf Sparrow Crib, these rail protectors are too small. Not sure how they would work if they fitted!
I bought this at babies r us. It did not fit my rail. It says it fits most standard rails but doesn't give any measurements. How are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it? What a pain.
I realized that there was a DC-10 power cord (bulky) on my power strip and wondered if this would be able to fit it. This didn't register until after I had bought the cover. When it arrived I was pleased to find that it was big enough. My boy is only 10 months and has yet to get his little hands on it. I'm confident he will be unable to open this if he finds a cord and follows it back to the power.
Works as intended at a good price. One drawback is that it is really hard to open even for adults. I wanted to use it on an extention cords with items I often plug in and out. With this device it is only practical to have cords that are infrequently changed.
This does what it is supposed to do - keeps my daughters fingers out of the extra outlets in the power strip.  That's a win in my book.
This securely protects the surge strip plugs from little hands. My baby loves to go toward the cords and when she's grabbed toward them, this holds up. We keep her from them on a regular basis, but on the off chance she's near them, this does the trick.
Everyone with a power cord and a child should have this. Its simple and amazing! Worth every penny and more!
This thing is bulky and me no likeThough they snap and the locks are tightBut it's huge but I guess that's okBut won't be ordering more, it's not worth it to payOk so this technically does the job but it's stinking huge and the locks work too well in that it's a pain to open up to get more things plugged in so I guess it's best to use it for power that you won't need to touch for a while
I had to put one of these on my computer power strip as my son wanted to push the button with the light on it, this is great and I am very happy with my purchase, you cannot go wrong with buying this.
it doesn't work for HUGE plugs (like our roku), but will work with every other TV/Stereo/cable/etc component we have!  our daughter figured out the on/off button on our power strip, so i ordered this the very next day and it's wonderful!!  she tried to turn everything on/off again and found out she couldn't and now she stays away from that area!  a total life saver and pretty sound product!!
This is challenging to get open and closed for the adult in the equation. There are a series of little pegs that must fit into little holes to get it to latch. But they are quite challenging to get to line up correctly and heaven forbid you need to get it back open. Now you would think that that's the point of the power strip cover, right? Except the hole that allows the cords to come out the top is so wide that my 9 month old just sticks his hand right inside and can put a finger in the socket. It does come w a couple outlet plugs for the extra slots in your power strip, I was just hoping this would work a wee bit better. If all you really need is to prevent your child from unplugging things from your power strip, than this will work for you.
This does what it needs to do.  It's a bit ugly, but keeps our daughter from playing with the plugs.  We ordered another one already.
I have a basic single row power strip, and i couldn't shut the smaller side door or it would depress the power switch... therefore making this completely useless to me.The snap buttons are hard to open and close, so it would be good to keep little fingers out, but i just couldnt use it for my power strip.The stip i have is SIMILAR to this one,&lt;...>but not exactly the same. Mine is dark color and newer looking with spots labeled "adapter" so you can plug in large plugs and not lose any outlet space.
Not very easy to open and close, which is great for baby proofing but not good if it's something you want to unplug frequently. Otherwise it works well and holds a large power strip.
Easily contains our power strip and multitude of plugs behind the TV. Not the most attractive solution, but it works.
This is a very useless item.  It doesn't protect children from sticking their fingers inside the cover.  This is easily done even by myself through the top where the cords are supposed to come out.  A child can easily unplug anything inside the cover and get their fingers inside, which completely defeats it's purpose.
this is the best/cheapest for keeping little hands away from extension cords and looks better in person - it's white not beige
This is a great protector for over the power strips! I had difficulty opening the part where the outlets go but that's a good thing cause I wouldn't want my little guy to be able to get to them easily! Included with the package are several plug covers to put in unused outlets on the power strip. I forgot about one of our power strips and I'm not hesitating to buy another one of these!
This seemed effective at stopping our 8-9 month old playing with the power strip, and certainly he cannot get his fingers into the live sockets with this cover.  It does organize the wires better, so although he could still play with them, he's less interested, and I have time to pick him up and put him somewhere else without there being a hazard.  However, he could get his fingers into the gap if he wanted to, but I don't think that's a problem currently, maybe when he's older there could be potential for getting fat fingers stuck.  Also,maybe he'll be able to open it in the future, but the latches seem stiff at least for the initial few months, making it hard even for me to open! It allows many different shape plugs, but sometimes companies make strange shapes so those don't fit, which is annoying, and there is probably no product on the market to allow for those odd shapes.  At the moment I'm happy with this product and after a month trial, I bought another two for elsewhere in the house.
I'd move along if I were you.  While this does the trick there are better products out there.  This is not the saftey strip you've been looking for.
These are great. I'd had issues with my daughter crawling around and unplugging, or turning off power strips if she got to them. This makes them very secure. She cannot force them open, and cannot get to anything. Definitely recommended!
This is one of the worst products created for child safety. It didn't fit our standard power cord, the front section opened really easily (actually had a hard time getting it to stay closed) and once we opened the back section to plug things in, couldn't get the back section closed again. Also, the opening at the top is huge! Definitely big enough for my 9-month old to stick her fingers in, which is kind of the opposite of its purpose. I sent it back and moved around furniture to hide our power cords instead.
We got this for the power strip in our livingroom by our tv.  It does a great job of hiding the strip and the plugs and I like that you can open the part of the on/off switch separate from the section where the plugs are.  But there also lies the problem with this.  The clips on the side are not easy to reattach.  So as long as you don't plan on opening and closing this a lot then it works great.... but if you need a cover over a strip that you need to access a lot, then this one will most likely frustrate you quickly!
I purchased this changing table in the summer of 2002 (my baby was due in Sept) I put it together very easily by myself. When I read the directions I was disappointed when it said to only use this table for babies up to 20lbs (I was having a 10lb baby) so I didn't think I would get much use. I couldn't afford a more expensive one so I kept it. My son is now 2 1/2 yrs. old and weighs 35lbs and we are still using it!!!! Yes, the middle shelf has a little sag in it (very little) but other than that it's perfect!!! I am so suprised by how sturdy this is!!! After reading some other reviews, I can't believe how many other people don't like it. I'm using it till it can't support my son anymore and gives out but no problems yet. I store toys and diapers on the other shelves. I would highly recommended this table and it's so affordable too :-)
We bought this for about 70 bucks and got 4 sage lined wicker baskets to fit within it for organization.  Great table, that does the trick.  Fits almost everything we need for clothes, and we have a diaper depot hanging off the side to fit all the changing table items.  :)
For my fourth baby I bought all new nursery furniture. Since she is my last I didnt want to spend a ton but I did want good stuff. I love this table. It has tons of storage, was easy to put together and is solid. I have also loved the matching crib and dresser!
We purchased this table to go with the White Jenny Lind crib we bought. Table was very easy to put together and is extremly sturdy. Having two children I couldn't possibly see the point in spending $150 or more for a changing table that you can really only use for the first year depending on the size of your child. We've been using ours now for 4 months and I have no complaints.
Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief!  Didn't even use it once!  Don't bother!!!  Just use a pillowcase & it works just as well...
We recently bought this pad for our changing table in the blue color. It's very soft and fits well with our pad, which was made by another company. Another viewer was right about the lack of slits to pull the straps through to hold the baby. However, our son isn't extremely squirmy so we don't use the straps anyways. He hates it more if we use them and he's more still if we don't. Overall, we like this cover, especially for it's cost.
Very convenient. Baby (4 months) is not gassy at all. But to be honest I didn't try any other type of a bottle since this one works so well.
I've been using the playtex drop in system since my daughter came home from the hospital and I love it. I have never had a problem with them a must have for new mothers
These are great. They save time and don't leak - like the standard bags sometimes do. HOWEVER I will only buy the generic ones from now on since they are so much cheaper! You can get both sizes at Walgreen's, Walmart and Target. Save your money!
I was under the impression that the liner collapsed as baby was drinking, but that is not the case, so I'm not sure how this system is any different than a normal empty bottle.The only thing it makes easier is cleaning, since I can just drop the liner in the garbage and use another one next time.
I didn't want bottles with a ton of moving parts that needed to be washed carefully. Using these allows at least part of the bottle to be clean every time, so you only have to worry about cleaning the nipple (and the bottle base, but that doesn't usually get very dirty at all).
I have some Dr. B brand bottles. They are awesome. But when I was a first time mom, I hated washing bottles and parts. It didn't take much time, but still it took time. So I switched to Playtex Drop-Ins bottles. Yay! I rinsed tons of nipples and washed them all at once later on the day. Now I have my 2nd child. Playtex Drop-ins is the only one I use.The liners are expendable. It designed for the bottle. It's durable and doesn't have plastic smell like other generic brand I used once.Please note: If you want to use generic brand liners, you fill water to the water lines ON THE LINER instead of the marks on the bottle itself. The water level/volumn is different.
These are so easy. I don't have to wash a million bottles anymore! I just have to wash the nipples. The only complaint I have is that I pre-fill with water and dump in the formula when I'm ready, but when I put in the 8 oz. and let the bottle sit for a while, the bag expands a little so it only looks like I have 7 oz. So the measurements may be a little off. I would use a measuring cup to make sure you get exactly how much water you want and not rely on the liner's measurements.
Since these are used for only minutes and then tossed away , and never heatedto a dangerous level, the baby is safe and colic etc . is reduced. Only glass bottles are safer but they do not reduce colic..so I choose theseUsed them on 2 healthy kids and loved them
I love the drop-ins system.  I used them for my first daughter when I went back to work and my family who watched her loved the convenience of them. I am using them again for my DCP for my second daughter. There is less washing needed during the day as the bottle doesn't get dirty.  I have never had an issue with these and was happy to find them on Amazon!P.S. There is also a system you can buy to pump directly into the bottles.  It was cheap and saves a step!
The plastic drop in bottles work perfectly well.  I recycle the plastics and I don't have to wash the bottles.
these leak and don't colapse use the older rolled liners they do not leak.  and you can see them colapse like they should
What's to say, they do they're jobDrop-ins are straight forward and they get from me a nodThough at times they feel like a wasteBut saving time not cleaning puts a smile to my faceThese do 4 ounces, but when you get to 4 ounces it's probably better to just go to the 8 ouncers becase you have to remember that you need to put in formula into the water and it's nice to have some space to mix the formula.
I tried Avent and Dr. Browns before switching to Playtex Drop Ins.  I liked all three but Playtex drop ins are so easy!  And, the way the nipple is, for my daughter, seems to be the most natural and closest to breastfeeding.  if you feel the nip, sounds weird!, it has a texture to it that other bottles don't.  most bottles nips are pretty "hard" unless you go latex...which scared me because I didn't want to find out the hard way that my baby had a latex allergy!  Anyway, the silicone nip on the playtex nursers is much softer and pliable so the baby can kind of pull on it as she wants to.  It's great!  I highly recommend.  Hopefully this review is not too strange :)
We've been using these and absolutely love them! So much easier to clean than other bottle systems. Can easily remove all air to improve gassiness and colic in little one. Just press in the liner from the bottom. We are currently supplementing with formula and only using 2oz per feeding in a 4 oz liner, and it is still easy to remove the air.With the ring and nipple loosely on the bottle we carefully press on the liner from the bottom until the liquid level nears the top of the liner. Then we tighten the lid and continue to press any remaining air out through the hole in the nipple (be careful when pushing up on the liner before tightening the lid as liquid can easily overflow). If your fingers are not long enough, we sometimes use the handles of some of our kitchen serving utensils to aid in removing the air.
I have no idea why I spent so much money on Avent (leaks all the time and too fast flow) and Dr. Brown's (difficult to clean).  I love this disposable liners because I just discard them after use, which is awesome when you have a baby to take care of.
I've been using these liners since my baby was 3 months old. They work great, they don't leak, and they make my life so much easier. These are ESSENTIAL for our out of town trips. I would take a box of liners, only about 3-4 Drop-ins nursers, and about a dozen extra nipples and caps for a 3 day trip. With my older kids I had to lug a whole plastic bin full of bottles plus the microwave sterilizer when we went on trips!
Perfect and fast sterile use. Using these for my grandson. Used them when his mother was a baby and still love them.
I've been using the playtex drop-ins since my daughter was born and she never had much problems with her bottle. No upset stomachs (I think she may have had 2 ever and she is now 19 months old) and spit ups were uncommon. I know it's added cost and waste, but I am not willing to give up the convenience and how well they work for us.
I've tried other brands of drop-ins and Playtex is the best. I won't try another brand. And you can't beat the price on Amazon (for 100).
Classic brand, and will be great for faux formula for 'reborn' baby dolls (they are very popular, and for me, a better option than a real kid :D  (I'm middle-aged and disabled, but do love a cute baby !!).  One diaper, one bottle, and no college fund.  Perfect kid !
I love the drop in system bc although you have to buy liners, it's easy, sanitary and really helps reduce air intake. My only issue is when I put the liner in and use the bottle to measure- it's slightly off so I have to pull the liner out and check the (example) 6oz mark and I am using the bottles that are made for expandable liners so something is off and I like to be as precise as possible... It's  not that big a deal but I wish the bottle lines and liner matched perfectly.
I love my playtex drop-ins. I have been lucky to always receive liners that are intact and work just like they are suppose to. Easy clean up, great price. Love them.
I've been using these for almost a year and they are great. It's nice to not have to clean the inside of the bottles every night. We've had very minimal leakage issues. And I do think there is something to Playtex's claims that it reduces gas/air. Also not terribly expensive over the long-run. I will use the Playtex Dropin system again with my next child.
I started using these when my baby was 1 month old. Its great to not have to scrub bottles all the time! And I believe it helped w/ her colic. I still love how convienent these are.
use with playtex storage system. It is the best way to pump in place for use later. Both daughters use these with the storage kit. o cleaning bottles.
We used Playtex drop-ins for both of our children. I prefer buying them from Amazon, because they are must cheaper than the store. You get more for your money. These drop-ins are great quality. You don't have to worry about your child getting air in the bottle. I would highly recommend these to others!
This is my 3rd baby.  We used playtex bottles with liners for our first 2 kids and loved them!  I guess Playtex decided to change their bottle sometime between our last baby and this baby.  The liners no longer match up and it's hard to see the numbers.  We decided to scrap it all and go with another brand completely, unfortunately.
I started the first month of motherhood washing and sterilizing bottles multiple times a day. Then I came upon these Playtex nursers with disposable liners, and now I only use a regular bottle if I have to.  Valuable time has been saved, now that I'm using these things instead!The only caution I have for others out there is to be very aware of the measurements. Because the liners can accommodate 8-10oz of fluid, don't trust the measurements on this. I noticed the difference when I poured 5oz of pre-measured milk that had been stored in a milk storage bag, and when it was in the Playtex bottle, the bottle indicated only 4oz of fluid.Aside from needing to be more conscious of the measurements, this bottle liner system has been a life changing discovery for my household.
It is very easy to just drop in a sterilized liner and clean the nipple. Very quick and easy to get a feed in. I can't go with anything else except for Dr. Browns bottles, I do have those also.
I have been using those for months and will keep using them. They are convenient because it is easy to prep a per-sterilized bottle without having to worry about cleaning bottles. I usually rotate with 4 nipples so I always have at least one clean to put on the bottle and it is ready.The bags don't seem to collapse as the milk is drunk. This might be more an issue with the bottle itself than the drop-in.First few times I wasn't careful in positioning the drop in and ending up pouring the most of the milk on baby due to a bad leak. After doing that twice I was more careful in positioning the drop-in.Conclusion it is a great idea, time saver on cleaning.
Drop in liners do make bottle cleaning so much less time consuming then before. Too bad Playtex is quite expensive. I tend to go back and forth between these and the store brands. I've found that most store brands work just as well and at a fraction of the cost. However, when I bought them on Amazon this time they were at a descent price plus a $1 off coupon which made the purchase worth it.
These make bottle cleaning and heating near effortless. My precious baby isn't nearly as gassy either. These are a godsend.
We use these whenever we are away from home (take up less room in a diaper bag or suitcase) Took her a while to get used to the nipple on the bottle. But she's pretty easy to feed. If there's food in it, she'll figure out how to use it,lol. I am pleased with the price of these, they are more expensive in stores.
These are great liners.  I like the whole playtex drop-ins system.  I have less to clean up with these, which allow me more time to spend with my baby.
We were shopping one night and decided it would be easier to buy formula, liners and diapers from amazon than going to the store. I didn't realize it would save us money also!
These drop-in liners are great. However, some of the liners were very squished and collapsed already while in the box. So I had to stretch them out so I could put the formula in. No biggy, but just odd. These are convenient and worth the money. I recycle them too after use and rinsing. Good product.
These liners are much better then the bags: it is easy to use, and save lots of time on cleaning bottles!
I have used disposable drop-in liners from multiple stores (Wally-World, the bullseye store, & various drugstores) and find that they all work just as fine as these Playtex ones do, but at half the price.  I like that the Playtex liners are thinner feeling, meaning the liner collapses better inside the bottle when baby is drinking...but even with the others feeling like a thicker plastic, they work as well.  Playtex, come down in price and you'll get 5 stars instead of only 4.
I used these with my first daughter 8 years ago. They are wonderful! You do not have to sit and wash bottles constantly. The baby will also have less gas since there is little to no air to contend with. The only difference with these are that they are expandable. This may make a difference for some using formula in respect to measuring differently with the expansion. I will be using them to store breast milk for when I go from breast to bottle as baby gets older so the expansion won't affect me any. I recommend these liners for everyone.
The playtex with drop-ins system works great. Makes cleaning super easy - since you don't need to sterilize the bottle every time you use it. The liner and the nipple are the only things that come in contact with milk - the liner is disposed off after one use, and the nipple can be easily sterilized.This system works particularly well when traveling. I introduced these to my son when he was 2.5 months old and we were on a flight for 16 hours. I simply took 2 nurser bottles, lots of liners, and many nipples. Made cleaning super easy on the flight - and gave me the piece of mind that everything was sterilized. The biggest advantage was that my luggage was a lot less bulky (as opposed to traveling with 8 glass bottles).The only downside: The 1 oz, 2 oz, 3 oz etc markings on the nurser are not correct. You should use another system of measurement to figure out how much milk/water you want to pour in the nurser.
I love this bottle system! My whole family used these with their children so I decided to try them on my son and jeebus christ these are amazing. They definitely cut down on gas and are such a time saver! Out of the whole box of 100 that I purchased twice NONE of them leaked!
This product works directly with our Medela breastpump with the use of adapters that come with the breastpumping kit.  It is nice not to have to transfer the breast milk from one container to another.  I cannot comment on the freezing aspect since I did not make enough milk to be able to freeze.  The only downfall to the liners that we found is measuring out the quantity is not accurate if the liner isn't fully expanded.  We measure in a different container and pour into the liner.  The best part about this system is that we are sure that the container holding the milk is clean- we just don't trust a regular plastic bottle to come completely clean.  Our other bottles are the good old fashioned Evenflo glass bottles.  All in all, we recommend this product.
These things work really well for storing milk.  Easy to fill, and disposable.  I just wish that they were a little more solid around the top edges.  I would still buy them and use them again on my next child.
We've used these (and the four-oz size) every feeding since he was brought home 5 months ago.  Such a time saver for clean up and disinfecting.  We couldn't live without!
I like to keep a few of these with me for changing in public places or changing an extra dirty diaper. Just the right size, and leakproof.
People...please don't get ripped off. I went to Walgreens and got a large 50 count of underlayment pads that fit perfectly on our changing table for 3.99  Please don't fall victim to the cute designs and baby marketing gimmicks. These work...but you can get the exact same thing at your pharmacy for much much less.
I love these and will be buying more.  I like that is made of tissue paper and nothing plastic.  They absorb pretty well--I admit that when my son decides to pee in the middle of a diaper change the sheet does get wet very fast, but 95% of the time it doesn't leak into my changing pad sheet. I usually throw away the wet peewee pad right away so it doesn't have time to leak anyway. These really are a lifesaver and save me from excess washing of the changing pad cover. I only wish that Amazon sold the 108 ct instead of just the 36 ct pack.
Very handy item to have available. Heats faster than boiling and more efficiently/safely than the microwave.  The only problem I've found is that the heating instructions included with the warmer are overestimated. If you set it to a lower temperature (between 1 and 2) and let it warm longer, it's easier to prevent overheating.This warmer DOES HAVE an ON/OFF SWITCH, but still no built-in timer (the oven timer works just fine).And as far as the bottle floating around during heating, you can put the bottle in BEFORE you add the water, and fill up the water to the same level as the liquid in the bottle to prevent uneven bobbing.My son is now 1-year-old and no longer uses bottles, but I still use this warmer for his refrigerated baby food and even to warm up a cup of milk for him.
I use this warmer to warm both formula and breast milk. I find it easy to use. The warmer is small, compact and comes with a 4oz avent storage bottle and a spoon for baby food. Unlike other reviewers, I have an on/off switch at the back. I am not sure if it's a different model from theirs.The warmer heats the bottle evenly and I have had no problems. Personally, I think it beats the running water method (and is much faster). However, if you don't stand there and keep an eye on it, you are liable to forget about it and the milk can overheat. That is the biggest drawback, though I am not sure how avent would change that, since if the warmer automatically shut off, the milk might get cold!!The other issue some people have mentioned is that bottles float! They only do that if you fill the warmer with too much water. There is a Max line for the water on the warmer and for smaller bottles you only fill water to slighlty above the level of milk. That insures that the bottles remain steady...and don't float.Overall, I like the warmer. It's convenient, easy to use, small and nice!!
The bottle warmer works as advertised.  I like the aesthetics of it and it lasted without a problem through my son's eating-at-night period.It may overheat the bottle if you don't monitor it, but it worked well for us.  Just keep an eye on it.
My baby is an Advent baby. I love all the Advent products, but was a little disappointed with this one. The bottle warmer, is maybe too good of a warmer, as it tends to overheat the milk even before the recommended time limit. The timings really should be precise.
So we have used this bottle warmer for over 8 months now. I have to say, with all the sleep deprived parents using this item, often in the middle of the night, you would think that Avent would be wise enough to put an auto-shut-off feature on this little doohickey. But, no. I exclusively feed my baby breastmilk, and that stuff is like "liquid gold" (from what everyone has told me, and I'm inclined to agree), and I can't even tell you how often I have put a bottle in the warmer to warm it and then forgot it was in there for like 15 minutes. The milk gets boiling hot in that time, and then it's useless and I have to pour it out because it's not supposed to be heated to boiling. I know people are probably going to read this and wonder how one could forget that they put a bottle in the warmer, but now that our baby is sleeping through the night, it's more for when my husband is giving her a bath, I will get the bottle ready for him as he gives her a bottle after her bath and puts her to bed (his time with her during the week). So many times I have forgotten it was in there and burned the milk, but also - and this is the really dangerous part - the light will shut off for like 30 seconds at a time (what they call "blinking", if you can believe that), and so often it will look like it's turned off when there is no bottle in it, but it isn't, and it will just keep heating the water in there until it's all gone. We have found it on after a couple of hours away from it because we didn't notice the "blinking" light because it was off at the time, and there is no other indication that it's on from the front. The switch is on the back and it's not clearly marked "on/off" either. I can't imagine how it hasn't caught fire for other people or melted the plastic when the water is all gone. Thankfully, I have noticed it before the water was completely gone, but it was almost gone. How unsafe! Anyway, I still use it because I haven't found one with an auto-off feature, but will be looking for one. I have to set the timer on my microwave now whenever I put a bottle in because half of my brain cells disappeared when my baby was born apparently, and I'm way too distracted to remember it's on. BAD DESIGN!!!
I received this as a gift and was surprised at how quickly this warms bottles.  However, if you don't pay attention, it will overheat the bottle.  It would really be helpful if there was a timer or auto shut-off because the water can become scalding.  I usually use the wide-neck bottles so I don't have the "floating" problem but the few times I did use the slim regular bottles and did experience the floating bottle.  The upside is that it does accommodate the wide neck bottles.  It's also an easy-to-clean item.
I thought the idea of a bottle warmer was a rediculous waste of money before I had my daughter. I breastfeed, but have a hard time functioning in the middle of the night, so I pump during the day and warm a bottle for the baby in the middle of the night. For three weeks I boiled water in a pot and held the bottle with metal tongs...not ideal for someone half asleep. Once we coughed up the money for this warmer I was a much happier, half-asleep mom. It only takes about 8 minutes to heat a 5 oz. bottle. Since the heating elements are on the bottom of the product, I would suggest swirling the bottle and testing the temperature before giving it to the baby, better safe than sorry. Cleaning of the product is ultra-easy as well, vinegar, water and some soak time and it's good as new.
I like this bottle warmer.  It warms up the bottles quickly and that means alot at 3AM with a screaming, hungry baby.  I use the Dr. Brown's bottles with it and they fit fine.  I haven't had any problems with uneven heating or anything like that.  I have even taken the warmer with me when we go to friends houses so I can heat up the bottles quickly.  I strongly suggest that you do not put the nipples on the bottles while they are in the warmer.  It causes the formula to overflow from the nipple.  Found that out the hard way.  Other than that, I haven't had any problems or issues with the product. I would suggest this to parents looking for a small warmer.
I didnt really care for this. I couldnt tell when the bottle was ready and the light would go on and off and not warm the bottle or else get it to hot. Might be user error but I didnt care for it.
My sister-in-law told us not to register for this because she couldn't get it to work.  Well, I wanted it and I registered for it anyway.  We got it and I decided to give it a try just to make sure it worked.  I used it the next time my friend came over with her newborn and it worked great.  Just add a little water, throw in the bottle, and in minutes it was perfect.  My only suggestions would be to add an on/off switch and a timer.  But other than that, it's another great product by Avent.
Save your money.  You can heat a bottle faster under hot running tap water or by heating a bowl of water in the microwave and sitting the bottle in it.  This bottle warmer is definitly not a necessary item.  It is expensive and it takes too long to heat a bottle.
I first purchased another bottle warmer which I promptly returned because it did not work.  I received this bottle warmer as a gift from a friend who has three children, two of which are twins.  So, I figured she knew what was good and what was not.  And she was right, this works well.  I read some of the other reviews of this product but can only say I've had no problems with this.  It's easy to use and always warms the bottle just right...not too hot, not too cold.  I'm very pleased with this product.
it's a very practical item, it saves time and avoids forgetting milk/food being overcooked/boiled!is very easy to clean.is not heavy at all, you can carry it everywhere.
Several reviews complain about features of this warmer, but I think it is wonderful.  I use Avent bottles and Gerber baby food jars in it with no problems.  If you put the bottle/jar in the warmer first and then add the water, the bottle/jar will not float or tip over.  It has three heat settings for how warm you want your bottle and a red light on the front shows when the bottle is warming.  The light shuts off when done, but if you leave the warmer on, it will heat through another cycle.  It heats so quickly though, that you don't have time to get distracted and leave the bottle to get too hot.  Even if it had auto shut-off, a bottle left in hot water will continue to heat and could be too warm to serve to your baby.  It uses a coil to heat and I've heard that these type of heating mechanisms should be unplugged when not in use so that they won't get ruined, but there is an ON/OFF switch on the back of the warmer if you'd rather just use that.  The basket inside is removeable and makes it easy to pull out 2.5 ounce baby food jars.  The warmer is small, convenient and easy to clean.  I am very happy with it.
This is a really great product... With just a little bit of water it sterilize everything really fast and it turn off by itself...And it's big enought to put almost everything you  want to... I really prefer this one instead of the microwave one because the other one is smaller, what means that you have to spend more electricity because you have to sterilize more times!!! And not even try to boil the bottles in the stove .... believe me, you would forget to turn it off... That has happend to me a thousand times in my mother's house!!
I have to say, I love this. Easy to use and most of all,its clean.
I bought this Sterilizer and I am so glad I did.  I was planning on breastfeeding but when that didn't work out, I found myself making formula everyday, sometimes twice a day. I can fit 6 Avent bottle set-ups in the sterilizer and it works great.  It is quick and easy to use, not to mention it looks great on my countertop.  It doesn't take up a lot of space and it looks nice.  Two thumbs up for this product!!
Since we had twins we were going Through A LOT of dirty bottles. I didnt want to put the bottles in the dishwasher with all the other dishes. I didnt want to always have to boil the bottles on the stove either. So we purchased the Steam Sterilizer and im so happy we did. It has a permanent place on my counter top. I cant even count how many times i have used this in the past 6 months. And it still works at good as the first time. We have all avent bottles so i dont have a problem with bottles not fitting. Other reviews said the bottles were very wet when they came out...but if you think about it..they would be after all the sterilizing. After mine are done i just put them on the bottle dry rack and let them dry. Its just like when you wash them in the sink but this way you know they are getting clean ALL OVER. I think also that the dishwashers water gets hotter than this and does something to the nipples to the bottles. Ive had some friends who ran into shrinking nipples after putting them in the diswasher. I would rather be spending time with my children than standing over the stove boiling my bottles and part. It only takes 8 mins. Im very happy with our purchase
I am primarily breastfeeding, but I thought this would be useful for sterilizing pump parts and the occasional bottles, etc..  I discovered Medela Microwave Steam Cleaning Bags instead, and this thing went in the closet.  I feel badly for the waste of money...but the bags are SO much easier!!!  And not space consuming.  Plus you can use them during travel, at the office, etc..  Much more cost efficient and useful!
This sterilizer is GREAT!  My girlfriend boiled her bottles and I can't believe how much easier (and safer) this is!  This only takes minutes and no risk of steam burns!I also sterilized the Avent breast pump and all of its parts in this sterilizer.  It worked great!Another plus:  the two racks with the tiny holes (not the one that the bottles rest on) can be snapped together to form a "basket" if you wanted to throw stuff into your dishwasher.  I've never done that...I'd rather sterilize the bottles and nipples and stuff using the steam from the water and not use detergents from a dishwasher...my baby's not even a month old yet...maybe after he's older, I'll use that feature as well.  For now, this sterilizer is EXCELLENT!  Definitely worth the money!  We're very pleased with it.  We also have the Avent food warmer...another great buy!
Perfect for breast pump accessories.  IF YOU ARE BREAST FEEDING AND/OR PUMPING, YOU NEED SOMETHING LIKE THIS to clean all those pesky little teeny/awkward accessories.  But beyond that (as far as baby's bottles and bottle accessories/pieces, pacifiers, small plastic toys, etc.) if you have a dishwasher it probably has an optional steam-dry cycle that works just the same as this microwave steam sterilizer.
Despite the concerns about BPA we are using these bottles for our daughter, and using canned formula to supplement breastfeeding. The concern with BPA seems to be heightened when the bottles are washed with hot water, or sterilized at hot temperatures. We bought this sterilizer, but have stopped using it. However, we still use the dishwasher, which is fairly hot. I am keeping an eye on Avent's statements:[...]We keep using them because they seem to be really excellent bottles and nipples, she feeds easily and doesn't get a whole lot of gas. The nipples are designed so that you can graduate her to faster flow nipples as she gets bigger. We are hoping that the BPA concerns will turn out to be unwarranted.
This is a great product. I leave it on the counter and throw in pacifiers, WASHED bottles, etc all day then throw in the microwave when full. Uses much less water and energy than running the dishwasher.
I bought this sterilizer after trying to hand clean my breatpump - not feeling it was clean enough when i was finished.I haven't regretted it since.  It is so easy to use, so quick, and everything looks clean as well as being sterile.I use it for the pump as well as bottles.I throw my son's pacifier's in every once in a while as well - it works great!If you don't run your dishwasher everyday, you need this product!
I was not told by my doctor that I needed to sterlize my daughter's bottles, but I do anyway. This thing is great. It fits any type of bottle. I use it everyday. It so easy to use and fast. It takes only 4 mins to sterlize your bottles, nipples, pacifiers, etc.
I am one of those without a dishwasher, unfortunately.  I use this sterilizer a few times a day for my baby's bottles and parts.  I don't use Avent bottles - works fine with other bottles.  I have to agree about making sure it's shut/snapped properly.  You have to make sure it's just right before you snap -- otherwise, you will break a nail or two.  Also exercise caution when taking it out of the microwave.  I always use an oven mitt to take it out and when opening the lid to avoid steam burns.
This is a great sterilizer and is so easy to use.  It can also double as a place to store your bottles.  I and my baby hated the bottles that come with it though.  They leak and are awkward to hold.
I had an electric steraliser (which died) before buying this one.  I wish I had had this steraliser all along.  It's so easy to load up, everything fits snuggly and has it's place (I had trouble with bottles falling over in my electric steraliser), and extremely easy to wash and keep clean (the electric steraliser was a pain to clean - especially the element).As we use Avent bottles - 4 fit perfectly and are steralised in 8 minutes (our microwave isn't very powerful).  From the instructions it looks like other bottles fit easily as well.I use this daily and haven't had a problem with it - easy to use, easy to secure the lid and I use it for my bottles and dummies.Recommended if you are using bottles and especially the Avent brand.
This sterilizer is absolutely wonderful, especially if you take your baby on the road, i.e. to the grandparents' house.  If they've got a microwave, then you're ready to go.It's also very durable.  Ours gets lots of use every day and yet looks like it just came out of the box brand new.  Plus, unlike a bottle warmer appliance, there are no moving part or electrical components to wear out or break, so we expect we'll be using ours for years/babies to come.
This is such a great item and I can't say enough good things about it!  I use it several times a day for pacifiers, baby bottles, and breast pump bottles.  It couldn't be easier than popping things in the microwave for 5 minutes and knowing that your baby is getting sterilized items.A word of advice- be careful about removing it from the microwave.  The water inside and the steam can scald if you are not cautious.  Let it sit for a few minutes before opening, because the water can splash when opening the lid.
I really like using this product. It is fast and simple to use and holds a lot of bottles as well as my breast pump accessories. It makes sterilizing your baby products so much easier. Let's face it, who is going to go and boil a pot of water everytime you needs to sterilize stuff (which is every day when you have a baby!)Buy this simple to use product which will help to keep your baby healthy!
Very easy to use (I even use it to sterilize my yogurt jars for the yogurt machine !), and quick (3min in all) : it's a great product !
It's the best way to go! Regardless of whether or not you have  a healthy full-term baby, sterilizing the toys that may have been handled by other children or licked up by the dog is essential to keeping your already healthy baby healthy! Boilng is a good alternative but not everything can be safely boiled and some hot water doesn't cut it for me. Do yourself and your child a favor and purchase a sterilizer.
While we agree that a sterilizer isn't really needed, we liked having this one when we wanted to quickly sterilize our daughter's bottles.  It also sterilizes other pieces like breast pumps, etc.
The express steam sterilizer is really the easiest and most efficient way to go if you want to be assured that your baby's bottles are truly clean.  When I first started using bottles I would use the sterilizer between dishwasher uses.  But after repeated cleanings in the dishwasher, the ounce markings on the bottles started to fade away, and the plastic caps to cover the nipples started to change color.  From then on I've used the sterilizer exclusively. It is quick, easy and effective.  I have taken several extended trips with the baby, and it is so easy to travel with and store her clean bottles in. This is one of those products that may not be necessary to have, but I am so glad that I do!
I sterilized bottles and breast pumps the old fashioned way with my first child and in the begining w/ my 2nd child. NEVER AGAIN! This is a very simple, fast, effective and economical way to get just about everything for baby sterilized.
I love this.  This is the most wonderful item I have gotten.  I clean the bottles and then load them into this.  4 to 5 minutes later, the bottles are all sterilized.  I love this.  Since I express milk and freeze it, it is reassuring knowing that the storage containers are sterile.  I also love it because you never know if you are washing the bottles and pacifiers and such with warm enough water (I am a first time mom).  With the sterilizers I just have that reassurance that everything is clean enough for my baby.  This is well worth the money.  It is so easy to use and comes with extra bottles.
Every new mom should have this sterilier. It so easy to use and it's fast just pop it in microwave for 5 mintues and you got everything ready to go. This a must have for all new moms.
I love this sterlizer. It will fit anything that needs to be sterilized, including breast pump accessories. The wattage is simple to use, just look inside your microwave on the bottom with all the info and it tells you what wattage it is and them refer to the manual to see the time. Highly reccomended
This product gets the job done. Does what it says. All you have to do is add water and pop it in the microwave for 2 mins. I wish it were a bit smaller, but I suppose its size accommodates large bottles. I put bottles, pacifiers, breast pump parts in it without a problem.
This is a great item if you don't run the dishwasher alot.  We don't need to run ours daily, so the sterilizer works great and takes very little time.  Get a drying rack though, because the items will need to dry if you're not using them immediately.  Once I got a lot of bottles, I started running the dishwasher more and this became obsolete.
Wash 4 bottles, place them in the provided tub and 4 minutes later you have sterile bottles you can use( and store ) for the next 4 feedings. Very convenient.
I did not register for this but bought it after my son was born. I was sick of boiling water or waiting for a full load to run the dishwasher. I found that when I used the dishwasher bottles and nipples turned colors depending on the food that we ate that week. (red when we ate pasta). This is a great thing to have and we still use it a few times a week and my son is 10 wks old.
It's so simple, makes your life so much easier!!! The lit will close if you turn it until you find the right position. Also, remember not to sterilize more than 4 bottles at the time. It just works perfectly. My baby is 8 months now and I've been using it since she was born. GREAT!
I use this to sterilize my breast pump accessories, the occasional bottle, pacifiers and other plastic toys.  None of which are the Avent brand, but all work well in this unit. NO COMPLAINTS!  It's quick & easy.
I highly recommend this product whether you are breast or bottle feeding (or sippie cup for that matter). I did not originally register for this item because I didn't think it was necessary, especially since we have a dishwasher. This is a great tool to get all those baby/toddler items germ free. I mainly use mine for sterilizing my breast pump supplies, bottles, and pacifiers. 4 minutes in the microwave and its done. Its not necessary to sterilize all baby products but when something really needs to be, it sure beats having to run the dishwasher. There are just the 3 of us so we only need to run the dishwasher about twice a week. I find that I sterilize more often just because it is so easy to use this product.
This is THE best way to sterilize bottles, bottle pieces, pacifiers, and breastpump parts.  It is quick and easy.  Forget boiling water or whatever else, get the microwave sterilizer.
My almost 4 month old son is VERY small (24th percentile!) so the doctor recomended me buying a sterelizer, in other cases careful scrubing and just putting the bottles in the dishwasher would do, and it can save you some trouble. but for those people who need or really want a sterelizer, this ones great. Its much less expensive than the other sterelizers that take over all your counter space! It cleans my bottles very well, and I use mostly avent by the way. It can also sterelize my 2 1/2 year olds "magic cups" after he gets over a virus or if he had milk (another product by avent). It is fairly simple to use and much less stressful than boiling water, in my opinion. It also comes with 4 bottles, although my house is a bottle factory as it is! This sterelizer can also be used as a drying rack if needed. I love this sterelizer and it has kept my small son very healthy, happy and playful!
I used this item 3 times, now its collecting dust.  Most books that I've read and my doctor agrees that it really isn't necessary to sterilize bottles.  They only need to be washed in very hot soapy water.  My son goes through tons of bottles a day and its not convenient to sterilize them in this item.  You can only fit 4 bottles in there at a time.  Save your money and wash you bottles well by yourself!
I bought this one as well as the full size counter version. This one was really helpful with pacifiers and nipples. I had a harder time with bottles just cause not many fit in it. But I found that bottles in the dishwasher and nipples and pacis in the microwave steamer were much better. In the dishwasher the nipples sometimes come out with the white dish det. film on it, of course in the sterilizer..not..BUT please don't worry about being burned. Common sense tells you what to touch or not touch and honestly if you do it once...you won't do it again.. Overall better for the money then the bigger one from Avent.
This product is easy to use, works well and is FAST . . . and everyone knows that time is precious is a new baby.  I use Advent bottles & pacifiers and they fit perfect as do all the parts to my Medela breast pump.  I don't use the sterilizer every time anymore since my daughter is a little older now.  I run the bottles & pacifiers though the dishwasher so I feel comfortable with the heat they get from that.  This sterilizer is great though as it is very light weight and easy to store in between uses.  It's up to you & your doctor whether you need a sterilizer, but if you do decide to get one, definitely get this one.
This sterilizer did the trick.  We used Avent bottles and 4 oz and 9oz.  You can get a set of 4 bottles in this thing and it only takes 4 minutes to steam (based on voltage of microwave of course.)  I would recomnd this.
I was told that I could wash our baby bottles in our dishwasher and I would not need a sterilizer.  BUT we live in post housing on an Army base and our dishwasher is awful and hardly gets anything clean.  So I handwash all my bottles and bought this as an extra step to help me get them clean enough for my child.I really like this product a lot.  It is very easy to use and since I am using Avent products and an Avent manual pump, everything fits great in this sterilizer.  I can even pop pacifiers in there when they fall on the floor.  There are slots for basically everything and it all stays put when I am moving it around.I know that it isn't really necessary, but I like using it for that extra peace of mind that my baby is getting CLEAN bottles.  Every parent has different 'must haves' when they have babies and this is one of mine! :)
I love this sterilizer and AVENT products in a whole! I bought a sterilizer because I don't use the dishwasher at all, and well I just didn't trust it to 'sterilize' my baby's bottles well (especially the nipples!).  Well I must say that I'm very happy that I got this product.  It is VERY easy to store and does the job well. Avent bottles fit perfectly in it (as I'm sure you already guessed), but it also fits all other bottles!  I use it to sterilize my bottles, nipples, caps, pacifiers, teethers and breast pump parts.  I generally sterilize the bottles once a week, but if needed, I can take it out and sterilize her teethers, etc anytime.
MODEL SELECTION:There are two microwave sterilizer models marketed by Philips/Avent.  The first is the SCF271/07 (ASIN B001C3KXPG) and the second is the SCF271/02 (ASIN B000056OUH).  BOTH actually contain the basic Express II Microwave Steam Sterilizer which holds up to six (6) bottles or a combination of other items including microwaveable breast pumps, cups, etc.The only difference is that the SCF271/02 contains an ADDITIONAL two (2) of the 9oz/260ml  Airflex Natural Feeding Bottle and Nippple.Strangely enough as of this writing, Amazon is selling the SCF271/02 (the one that contains two extra feeding bottles) for a much lower price than the SCF271/07.  So until prices remain like this, know what you are buying and consider it a bonus to have the two extra bottles.TO STERILIZE OR NOT TO STERILIZE...WITH THIS MICROWAVE STERILIZER:The argument is not whether you should sterilize your baby products (or expose the baby to germs as argument in strengthening the immune system) because if you're searching for a sterilizer and reached this page, then I'm going to assume you agree with the sterilization process.The other argument in question is whether you are content with using hot running water and anti-bacterial soap or running a dishwasher and if these steps alone are enough to sterilize.  Well it doesn't help to take an extra step to go thru a short few minutes in the microwave.  Again, if you're in this page then you've come to accept that this sterilization process is worth the extra caution.HOW MANY MINUTES IN THE MICROWAVE AT FULL POWER AND 200ml OF WATER?2 MINUTES @ 1,100 - 1,850W, 2 MINUTES COOLDOWN4 MINUTES @ 850 - 1,000W, 2 MINUTES COOLDOWN6 MINUTES @ 500 - 800W, 2 MINUTES COOLDOWNI'm restating these from the manual because it's important to ensure proper use.  Too little water and you can end up damaging the sterilizer.  Too much water and you fail to properly sterilize.Check to see the wattage of your microwave.  The model number is usually a giveaway on this.How much is 200ml?  Your baby bottle should give you that info.Also remember to allow 2 minutes cooling time prior to unlocking the lid unless you want to be greeted with hot steam on your face and second degree burn or worse.HOW LONG WILL IT REMAIN STERILE?The manual further states that the items will remain sterile for 24 hours PROVIDED THE LID IS NOT REMOVED.  So yes you can sterilize in advance and leave it inside until you need it for the day.COMMENTS:Avent and Philips have consistently provided quality plastic products.  The look and feel is what I have come to expect.  It is well made and there are no rough edges or protruding plastic parts that may have not been molded properly.The manual will tell you how to position the items in the sterilizer versus simply dumping them in.  The point of the sterilizer is to allow hot steam to circulate around.  So incorrect position may mean not creating a good sterilization process.When all is said and done, this is a simple sterilizer you put in the microwave.  For the low cost it is offered, it's a small price to pay for extra security for your baby.  Follow the included instructions and enjoy.
This was the perfect solution for my pump parts and bottles. I read everywhere that you do not need to buy a sterilizer if you have a dishwasher, but I don't run my dishwasher fast enough to have my parts and bottles ready for each feeding/pump.  This fits all of my pump parts and 2-3 bottles and nipples.  It's ready in 4 minutes, which is way faster than dealing with the dishwasher.  You do need to prewash in soapy water, but I don't worry about scrubbing.  Overall, it does the job in a very short amount of time!
5 reasons to have the avent express micro sterilizer:- Reasonable price!!- It comes with an extra value of 4 avent bottles ( it says here that comes with two, but I just got mine and comes with 4!!)- Its great for travel,not too big, not too small.- Very very very easy to clean- It does the job in 4 minutes!you can keep it anywhere because of its convinient size ( and its made of plastic!)* I used to have an electric sterilizer and as soon as I heard about this one, I got it  and life with a baby it just  became simpler than ever!!!
I purchased this and it works wonderful...however, we do have a dishwasher and I find myself using that to clean the bottles over using the sterilizer.  I do still use in on occasion if I don't have a full dishwasher load to run.  This is certainly not a must if you have a dishwasher.  If you don't have a dishwasher I highly recommend it!
This is a truly wonderful product! I got mine on sale at a local Target store, and it included 4 9-oz Avent bottles as a bonus, so it was really a great deal. :)I was pleasantly surprised to see how EASY it was to use this sterilizer. I tried boiling huge pots to sterilize all the bottles, pacifiers and breast pump accessories, and it took forever to boil and turned out to be too costly. This sterilizer accomodates all my Medela pump attachments, Dr. Brown's bottles (that have 5 pieces each!) and a few pacifiers easily.  All it needs is 200 ml/7 oz of water and a microwave, and in 4-6 minutes you get it done! Since it's SOOO EASY to use, I also sterilize all my daughter's plastic toys in it. It doesn't take up much space on the kitchen counter (in fact I store mine on top of the microwave since I'm using it several times a day). The greatest thing about this sterelizer is that it gives me peace of mind that whatever goes into my 2-month old daughter's mouth is clean :)
I bought this right after my daughter was born and it is WONDERFUL!!!!!!!  It is used in my house daily and has been for 6 months.  Very happy with this product. Before I got a Medela pump, I used the Avent hand pump and used this to sterilize it.  Now it is just used for my Avent bottles but it's so helpful.  In four minutes, you have sterilized bottles and parts, 4 at a time.
I have used the Avent "II" sterilizer found at other retailers.  (probably not much difference between the two)  I have been using the sterilizer for one month since having my twins.  It has really been helpful cleaning non-Avent items (breast pump items, baby bottles, pacifiers, etc.)  It can sterilize in 2 minutes (depending on the power of your microwave).  You don't HAVE to have this sterilizer, but, it helps if you want to clean a few items without having to boil water each time or running your dishwasher.It came with two small Avent bottles.  I'm not reviewing the bottles themselves - that's another topic.  However, this is a nice feature so you can try these bottles out to determine if you want to use their bottles or not.
I purchased this along with my Avent bottles before I had my daughter. Six months later this sterilizer has done very well under heavy use (6+x/day) I quickly learned to use oven mitts to remove it from the microwave. It does get very hot. Of course that is the point - no heat no bugs killed!! Even got the hubbie to use it! This is one of those items I could not live without.I have the Medela microsteam bags for when I am away.
Pretty good. Sometimes the side containers pop off
We received the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot for ease of access to diapers. It attaches perfectly to the Gulliver Changing Table we have from IKEA which made me really happy. Accessing newborn diapers is a bit difficult since the diapers are much smaller than those used for older babies but that's fine since we won't be using newborn diapers for long. I'm curious to see how it will work with the cloth diaper inserts since we're planning on cloth diapering when our baby is out of the newborn stage. We haven't received our cloth diapers so I have yet to see. I'll post an update when I get them.I do wish it had a little larger storage for diapering supplies. With the wipers warmer in the caddy, it's difficult to see the supplies on the back side and I can only hold a pump bottle of hand sanitizer or a couple of tubes of diaper cream. Other than that, it's a handy product.
This holds all you need and more. Great size, good quality and versatile. Worth the money if you are looking for something to keep diapers in on a crib or play yard.
Overall, we've been very pleased with the quality of this product.  It was very simple to put together and was very easy to attach to the front of our changing table.  The top caddy easily holds one of the wipes tubs. The diaper caddy holds a variety of sizes easily...we were able to double stack the newborn size diapers and easily hold several of our son's size 4 diapers as well. The containers on the side are not huge and not very deep, but they are large enough to hold a few essentials (i.e. diaper rash cream, tube of aquaphor, etc). It will not hold larger items (i.e. bottles of baby lotion that are bigger than a tube).  This isn't a dealbreaker for me, as it's just as easy to store those items in a bin on my changing table. The acrylic is pretty sturdy...it's withstood at least one drop and a few accidental bangs and hasn't cracked.My only one (very minor) complaint is that the clip at the top isn't wide enough to attach to the side of my changing table. It's a bit inconvenient to have it in the front, but the opening only fits on the front (which is presumably what keeps it secure).  It's not a huge issue, but it would be nice to be able to adjust it. Overall, we've been very please with this and plan to order another to use on our secondary changing area on the pack and play in our family room.
Freed up space on my changing table as baby has grown and now takes the whole length!  Good quality product! Just make sure your changing table has a rail for it to hang on (see the pic).
This is a wonderful product. I actually purchased it used from an infant resale shop and I am so happy that I did. Initially the diapers seemed a little small in the large container but I soon discovered that newborn diapers could be stacked in two stacks which means the container holds twice as many! Now my son is about to turn one and his size four diapers are a perfect fit, we still use this item every day!
I like have this organizer, but on our changer (attached to the crib style) it sits just a little loose.
Although I gave the diaper depot a low rating I do have to say I like that it hooks on the side of my changing table. But the reason I gave it a low rating is for two reasons:1. No diaper warmer will fit on it... not even the Prince Lionheart brand2. There is a slit on the bottom so you can easily gain access to diapers... this seems great but the diapers stick together and you end up pulling out 3 or more diapers at a time. Not worth it.
We have had this product for 2 years now and it works great! We hang it off the side of the changing table and it keeps everything handy. The plastic is thick and it is very well constructed. The only issue we have with it was keeping the box of wipes from moving about in the space for the wipes. We just use the plastic flip top box the wipes come in and it isn't a wipe warmer so it is smaller. We couldn't take a wipe out of the dispenser using one hand without either lifting the lid off the box or lifting the enitre box. To solve the problem, we just bought industrial strengh velcro and attached it to the bottom of the box and the "lid" of the diaper depot. Great product after this minor adjustment!
It works really well for me. There's plenty of space for diapers, my wipes warmer fits on top, and I have odds and ends on the (removable) side compartments.
I have this attached to the pack & play in my first floor. It allows me to have a complete changing station without having to go upstairs to the nursery...very useful since I had a c-section and going up and down the stairs is not the most fun thing to do.
My son is huge and long for his age.  At 8 months he was way too long for the changing pad and his feet were kicking off the products and wipes at his feet.I ordered this product and it got everything off the changing table so he fits now with leg room to kick away without hitting anything.  Wipes are right there and we put a kleenex box in the diaper dispenser (the diaper dispenser isn't great--I'm not sure how it works w/o you grabbing more than one at a time.  We put the diapers on the shelf right under the table and put products and stuff in the lion heart thing.A MUST HAVE!!  I love this product.
I bought this because I am an Obsessive Compulsive - :) I just have to have everything in it's place.  Love this item.  Organizes everything nicely.  My only complaint is that the holders on the sides are not big enough for your standard - big baby powder.  I have to use the smaller 9 oz size.
This product is wonderful and better than I expected.  It is well made and I have recommended this product to my friends for the excellent quality of this product.  It is a must buy and well worth the amount I paid for it.  I am extremely pleased with this product and will buy again from this seller due to the quality  of the product :)
I love this product!!!  It is one of the few things that I knew I wanted with my second child that I didn't have with the first, and I have not been disappointed.  I use mine on my changing table and it keeps everything so handy in one place.  It is always neat and together, and I never have to look around for what I need.  My son is still in size 1 diapers so I do find that when I pull a diaper out another one might fall out.  This is a minor inconvenience for the organization that it provides.  The last thing you want in the middle of a diaper change is to be disorganized!
All my daughter's furniture is a variety of Delta Children's products and we own theDelta Eclipse Changing Table, White.  We already stocked the diapers, wipes, warmer, etc on the changing table and thought we were ready to go until our instructor at a baby class at the hospital gave us advice on changing our baby.  The instructor said it's a good idea to have everything out and ready when you change your baby, as sometimes they can be hyper or throw a fit.  If you're not ready to change them, the results could be disastrous.  Another tip was to "have everything should be within arm's reach", as you will want to place one hand on the baby at all times.Upon learning this, I asked my wife "isn't there some kind of "side cart" for the changing table where you can have the diapers, powder, wipes, lotions, rash paste, etc right there?"  She said there was, so I looked to Amazon to find it.  On a side note, despite registering for the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer, I've learned that you never get exactly what you register for - especially on your baby registry.  Instead, we got theMunchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmer - Greenas a gift.  That warmer itself isn't bad, but the compatible stand (Munchkin Diaper Duty Organizer) isn't what we wanted because it has to sit on a flat surface (like a dresser or table).  Remember I wanted one that hooks on the side of your changing table "within an arm's reach"There are other products that hook onto the side of your changing table, such asMunchkin Diaper Change OrganizerandDexbaby Nursery Organizer, Whitekind of fit what i'm looking for, but the "shell" is made of cloth.  Cloth makes things flimsy.  I wanted something more rigid and heavy duty.That's when I found the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot.  This thing is awesome.  Per the picture, it's got 2 removeable side compartments to store stuff like bottles, cotton balls, rash cream, etc.  The middle compartment is for diapers that you pull out from a slat at the bottom.  The top part compartment is for baby wipes, which fits your standard wipe case.  Although the Munchkin wipe warmer we own doesn't fit on that top compartment for wipes, it still does everything we need to for everything else.Highly recommended.
I like this product. It's easy to fill and the side compartments are very handy. I have the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer and it tends to slip out of the top part of the stand. Also when you go to pull out a diaper of the slot you usually get more than one.
I am a minimalist and do not like all the organizers that are insanely large.  This one holds a lot but is not large.  You can easily hold a day or two worth of diapers, wipes, creams, and lotions.  I have been using this for 9 months and I love it.
We were originally keeping the diapers and wipes on the shelf of the changing table, probably because we didn't think there was a better option. I am so glad we found this, it works and fits perfectly for our changing table.The only issue we have now is that the wipes are accessible by the child being changed, and sometimes she likes to sit up and try to grab the pack. But if this wasn't there, I'm sure she would just find something else to do that is just as inconvenient.
I was looking for something that would hang off of my changing table, out of reach of my unusually tall son's ferocious kick.  I was concerned about this because my crib is spindled, but it fits perfectly and is exactly what I was looking for!
I actually used this with my Pack N Play and loved the handy organizer features.  I moved it to my changing table after discovering I could order one of those Pack N Play Parent Organizers as a replacement part (even from another company's product!) which worked much nicer with my play yard.  Still - this item was very handy.  Note: it only fits on the "front" of a changing table or play yard (the attachment arm/hook is not wide enough to hang from the sides).Update at 1 yr: still using this item.  A good buy & fit on the pack-n-play but also on the changing table late on.
This is one of my most useful baby items.  I hang it on the side of the changing table and it holds diapers, wipes, and diaper cream.  It keeps everything conveniently close by.  You can also hang it on the side of those playards that have changing tables attached. I think every mom needs one of these!
This hooks right on the side of my pack and play! Everything I need for changes in one convenient place!
I didn't car for this organizer. It looks cheap and also like it might crack easily. There are nicer options out there, but they are more expensive.
pFits perfectly on our changing table and keeps everything nearby. I assumed it would also fit the same brand wipe warmer but it does not.
I bought this item to hang onto the side of our pack n play. It didn't work for what we wanted, and we sent it back. Thanks to amazon's awesome return policy. If your looking for something like this for your pack n play, I'd recommend something else. This doesn't fit over the edge of the pack n play.
This diaper depot is a life saver. In the middle of the night, the last thing you want to do is locate diaper, diaper cream, wipes, mylecon, tylenol, breast pads, etc.  Even though the rest of your house may fall apart, this will keep your baby essentials organized!!!!! Everthing fits in it great.  Smaller diapers may slip though too easy, but bigger ones like size 1 and 2 are fine!!!
This was a total piece of garbage.  Several things are wrong.1.  It doesnt fit every changing table.  When I attach it to mine, it tilts downward and is not level at all.  You need to have a bottom slat or base to support it under the top slat it will go onto.2.  The side compartments keep falling off because they dont attach they just fit over the edges.3.  The biggest complaint is that the wipe tray does not fit every wipe box or wipe warmer and we have the same brand name wipe warmer that made this product.4.  Consider that you will be taking away 5 inches of walk space around your changing table after you put this hunk of plastic onto it.If you have your changing table in a small area or corner of a room, this makes a difference.What a cheaply made piece of plastic.Pass this up and buy a wall shelf to go over the changing table instead.
This holds our wipe warmer and about 2 days' worth of diapers, so far so good.  However, the side containers really don't hold much.  We can fit diaper cream on one side, and our little man's brush and baby lotion on the other.  I keep hand sanitizer and lotion for me on the changing table between the pad and the edge of the table.  Wish it would hold a little more, but it's great to have the things it will hold within easy reach of our son while we're changing him.
it has enough room for about 15 diapers and a wipes container on the top.  The two side bins are removable (a little too easily if you ask me but no big deal) and we use them for small lotions, nail clippers, the nose aspirator, and a few other things.The large lotion bottle we have and the large &#34;tub&#34; of A+D ointment we use don't fit in this though so i have to keep those on the counter itself.This has a lip so you can hang it from the edge of the changing table but since we have rounded (sleigh style) edges, it doesn't fit there.  We ended up putting it on a drawer instead and it wroks just fine.  Only thing is that the drawer underneath the one we attached it to doesn't open (the diaper depot gets in the way since it's taller than the drawer).  No big deal.I would recommend this - it saves it space and keeps us organized.
I have no complaints about this. I did all my research before purchasing, ie: measuring the size of my daughters changing table...and this was a great fit. She's now 16 months (yes just writing this review now) and we still use it. Her size 3 Huggies diapers fit fine and of course you get a lot more newborn diapers in there. All her creams, lotions and accessories fit in the side compartments. Very pleased.
Its great, it fits so many items, i fit like 15-18 size 1 diapers, wipes, bottle of cream, tube of diaper cream, lots of small staff (hair brush, cotton swabs, nail clippers, alcohol pads, etc.) it very easy to put it together, i never had a problems with it falling down or falling apart. Plastic is very thick and seems sturdy. Well  this huge plastic thing doesnt look very attractive, but it super useful and clear, so u dont see it right away in the room.
This diaper caddy is a wonderful addition to our baby room which has very little counter space to put stuff. It fits our munchkin diaper warmer but just barely and holds about 20 diapers in the storage below. When you do pull diapers out sometimes 2 or more come out. The side holders aren't locked in so if you try to pick up the entire diaper caddy just by holding the side pocket it will fall.If you're looking for more reviews of baby registry essentials, read the baby registry guide from AllMomsArePerfect.com. Good luck!
~*My wipes warmer fits perfectly with this product. i also like that my diapers aren't exposed to dust while sitting inside the diaper depot. but it doesnt fit my graco pack n play straight, it leans.*~
I have a Prince Lionheart wipe warmer that fits perfectly on top. The diaper bin has enough space for around 14 size 3 Pampers diapers.
I read in the reviews that this would work on a graco pack n play but it doesn't fit on the side when the napper/ bassinet insert is in. Once my daughter outgrows the bassinet it will be fine and we still use it right now but it will be more useful when it fits. It does fit onto the end but sits at angle due to the curve.
My sister got me this for my shower and I love it. I also own the ultimate wipes warmer and it clicks right into the top of this. It holds quite a bit of diapers for size 1 and I'm sure as they get bigger it won't hold as many. I love having this because it's right on the end of the changing table, has everything I need in it and is a life saver. I wish it could hold more stuff as some of the bottles of baby junk I got are a bit big. Other than that I love this product and wouldn't do without it. Great price too!
We had a pack n play w/bassinet and changing accessory set up in our lower living room instead of always having to go all the way upstairs to the baby's room.  I love how this diaper caddy connected onto the side of the pack n play and we could have everything handy.
It's useless. The one I bought came broken into pieces and Amazon refunded me the full amount. Thanks to Amazon.This so inferior and cannot hold much. Nowadays I believe no one is using tiny soap bottles or cream bottles as it's cheaper to buy the big ones. This cannot hold any of those.
Love it, and it is a must in our babies room, but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer (Lion Heart 2004 model) does not fit correctly. To fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer. I love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course.Note:We do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great, especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and/or clean up from showers! Also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery's theme
This is great!It fits perfectly and securely over the side of the changing table. I like that the side holders are removable, because I only ended up using one of them. I was leery about this, since it's plastic and only cost ~$12, but it is AWESOME! Also, I got it from Amazon two days earlier than it was estimated to arrive (bonus!!).It is a very solid plastic - it is not flimsy at all. It's easy to pull out the diapers one-handed (from the bottom slot of the holder). I recommend this MUCH more than a hanging cloth "diaper holder" - this organizer is SO much more useful! It also puts the wipes right there - easy to grab!Highly recommended!
This was recommended to me by a fellow mom, and it works great! I was worried about limited space on my changing table, but this has fixed the problem. Highly recommend.
This is an awesome organizer that many of my friends use and love.  My changing table and crib have sleigh ends and unfortunately this makes the end piece too thick to fit into the hook.  I didn't think about this fact before ordering.  Oops!  Hopefully this review will save someone else some time/money.  Best of luck with your new babies!
we bought a second hand pack and play and there was no diaper caddy attached as some pack n plays offer. I ordered this, fast 2 day prime shipping, and upon receiving it, immediately tried it (empty) on the side of the pack n play. It fit and appears to be secure on the side so we can use the pack n play changing pad and have our diapering needs close by.
After purchasing the depot, I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top). I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type.
We have this at the top of our stairs.  It works great!  It is obviously not he prettiest thing over a nice railing, but it keeps our little one safe and does not obstruct the view much.
it does what a net should do....we set it up on our balcony.  Nothing more to add here as it's a net.
i use it in my indoor round stair and patio stair. to keep my child safe when walking up and down the stair. easy to install.
These are safe no doubt.Easy to installShort...So I need two to cover my relatively small balcony.No more toys and even dishes landing on innocent pedestrians.
Once you install this piece of netting, it really is a nice product.  Installation, however, is worthy of an epic stress fest.  The ties they include are nylon rope, cut into 7 inch or so strips.  Pretty much worthless.  We ended up using zip ties like some of the other reviewers and found that to work quite nicely for getting the netting taut. Along the bottom we did use their eye screws that they included.  It would be helpful if they had more holes along the top pre-drilled so where your railings don't perfectly match up you can switch holes one or two inches over.  Same thing for the corner, we found there was a pretty significant gap of where the horizontal and vertical holes met, therefore the corner kind of sagged.  We fixed this easily with a couple hand made holes, but they aren't quite as finished as the other holes.  Like I said though, once installed, this netting is virtually invisible and has been complimented on by many of our guests.
This works perfectly on my banister keeps baby safe from falling through the wide opening. This allowed me to save money because I didn't have to pay a handy man to add more spindles to my stairway banister.
When my daughter turned 4 weeks old we switched to the Primo Eurobath Tub.  It has been really great.  She flops around a little so we have to keep a hand on her, but I am sure it will be better suited for her when she gets a little bigger.  Better price on this elsewhere... so be sure to shop around.
We got this lovely tub after giving up on inflatablesSnug Tub, and a few smaller hard platic modelsFisher-Price Bath Center - Aquarium Ocean Wonders,Safety 1st Comfy Bath Center in Light Blue, andThe First Years Sure Comfort Newborn to Toddler Tub.It has been really great for us: bigger than most, but still small enough to cradle your baby or toddler. My daugther has always been big for her age, but at age 2.5 and 40" tall, she is still using and loving this tub. No other hard plastic tubs I've tried fit her beyond a year or so.The primo keeps the water much warmer than a porcelein tub does, which is good in winter- you really notice the difference if you ever have to bathe your toddler in a regular bathtub. You can't put much water in for safety reasons, and then it goes cold fast. The Primo EuroBath solves both of those issues nicely.I like that you can fill it pretty full for older toddlers so they stay warm and get to experience the feeling of a real, splashy bath (with toys) without the safety concerns and slipperyness of an adult tub. We try the big tub from time to time, but at age 2-ish, my daughter is still a bit wobbly, even just sitting in the tub and playing with her toys, and with the big tub being so slippery, the Eurobath feels much more secure for her. At her size, she can't physically slip and get underwater in this tub (without doing a handstand in it or something)!I also like that you can place your child in the saddle seat end or the more open end. Each side has some support, with the toddler end allowing more movement but not as much as just an open plastic tub- the plastic pommel in the center provides a nice barrier to force her to stay seated.And speaking of staying seated: you kind of have to stay seated in this tub- standing up in it is a little awkward, which is good. In the big tub, my daughter constantly wants to stand up to "just get another toy" or different soap or whatever. In the Primo tub, she forgets to want to, because it's just not possible or comfortable to try to do so.The only "con" of this tub for me is that it's not quite as cushy and comfy as our previous inflatable tubs, and the hollowed out areas in the underside can get water deposit buildup and stains and are awkward to clean, even with the Clorox bleach wipes I bought just for that purpose.Everything else about this tub rocks! I can see us continuing to use it for quite a while longer, until my daughter is a little more mature and can handle the freedom of the big tub. I just wish I had known about this tub when she was a newborn, as we would not have had to try out and discard 5 different tubs prior to getting this one!
We got this bath for our newborn. Unfortunately we weren't able to use it until very recently when she turned 4 m.o. The issue is that the triangle stopper is very wide on newborn side and my girl was crying when we put her in this tub. Even now she prefers to lay her legs on top of the stopper, not around.So for the first 4 months we used the infant bath seat made by the same company that was absolutely great. And the stopper in this seat is much narrower and much more comfortable for a baby.
I bought this when my son was too big for the sink at about 5 months. We used this for 6 months. I would hang it from the shower curtain rod with a plastic ziptie threaded through hole in the tub and then one of these "S" shaped rubberized hooks from the Container Store. After my son started walking and climbing, he just used it for leverage to climb out. I though that I would get more use out of this, but at 11 months it became unsafe since he was trying to climb out of the tub (not the tub's fault). So the eurobath was replaced with a rubber rub liner with suction cups and now he walks around the real tub.
Keeps baby nice and secure while still submerged in the water (those baby hammocks in other tubs don't really work well cuz baby is barely in the water).  Has two ways to sit - more of laying down side and a sitting up side for when baby can sit up.  If you don't have a deep enough sink for the puj tub, this works well for small babies too.
We bought this tub after our son outgrew his standard baby tub because we were nervous about putting him in our deep jetted bathtub. It's been a great item and our son LOVES his baths more than ever. The way the tub is designed works out perfectly for our wiggly toddler - it "holds" him in place so that he doesn't slip under. The drain is my only complaint - we use this tub by placing it in our "adult" tub and the way the drain is situated we have to lift the Eurotub slightly to get it to drain (or place something under it to prop it up) -also: the drain cap should've been designed to open in the other direction so the natural water flow when draining wouldn't close the cap so easily. Two tiny prices to pay for a great tub - I would definitely recommend it and I would purchase it again.
I use this tub along with the Safer Bather and absolutely love it.  While on vacation at a friends home I about lost my mind without this tub.  She had another baby tub and my daughter was sliding all over the place.  I have used the Eurobath with the Safer Bather from the start with my baby and she doesn't slide anywhere.  She is now 8 months old and loves to kick and play in the water.  I plan to buy this for my friend when she has her next child.  I think every parent needs a safe tub.
I bought this tub after reviewing almost all the other comparable tubs on here! My son was 5 months old when I bought it, and he is now 14 months... it works great for us! He is just starting to outgrow the small side (and he is very long for his age), so we just switch him to the other side or put him in the big bathtub if we wish. I love that this tub is BPA free, and it cleans/dries very well. It is large, but has plenty of room for your child as he/she grows. One of my most useful buys!
My daughter is 3.5 years old and I have been looking for a large enough sturdy bathtub for her.This one is just perfect in every aspect.It is large and deep enough for a toddler and very comfortable and stylish.My daughter is thrilled with it and loves her bathtime in her new Primo Euro Bath.It is easy enough to empty out the water and it fits perfectly in a standard bathtub.Definately a good buy.I would not reccomend it to parents of a newborn or a small baby.This is more of a second baby bathtub.
My 9 month old son loves bath time with the Fisher Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub.  It's got anti-slip for infants and same goes for the toddler position.  Only thing I did not like about the tub was that it's too shallow and my son is big for 9 month.  (I'm guessing the depth has something to do with safety).My brother who just has his daughter said his Primo tub was too big so he wanted to switch.Pros..it's bigConsit's too big and waste a lot of water.  over twice as much water as the FP whale tub.  Which I would not mind if it was bit deeper so my son can get a better submersion but it's not any deeper than the FP whale tub.Main problem is that Flooring is too slippery so my son was startled everytime his bum slipped against the floor.  He loves bath time with his Fisher Price Whale tub since he was an infant. Always smiles and never wanting to get but yesterday for the first time, I saw him startled and whining to get out of the tub.  Never once saw my son slip on the Whale tub.  In fact he would rotate and splash around while taking a bath without a problem.  With Primo tub he stopped dead on his track, scared that he would slip.I supposed you can put a towel to offset the slipping problem but I think I'd rather look for another tub.
we like that this tub is large enough to bathe a toddler in.  IT can be used for both babies and those that are old enough to sit up on their own
Like most parents, I try to streamline the baby gear I buy - if one product can have two uses or can be used into toddlerhood, I'm all for it. That was my thought when purchasing this tub. The idea of being able to use one tub from birth to age two seemed very efficient. While I do love this tub, if I had to do it again, it wouldn't be the only one I'd buy. While my daughter was about average length and weight at birth, I found she slid around quite a bit in this tub. She just wasn't big enough for the supports to be very effective. I put it away and just started bathing her in the sink. It was only at about four months of age did I feel she could fit into this tub comfortably. At that point she was in the 99th percentile for height and weight, and she fit into the EuroBath very well. Now, at a year old (and about 27 pounds!) we still use the infant/reclining side, since I love the extra help the molded parts give me while bathing her. We will probably transition her to the toddler side in a month or so. If I had known that I wouldn't use this tub early on, I would have bought a Puj tub or something similar for the sink for those first few months.Other that that, we love the tub. It's big, but that's a key feature. If you don't want a huge baby tub, try some of the other offerings. The drain hole is fairly efficient, the molded plastic cradles your child, and the price isn't bad (try Buy Buy Baby or BRU - both are cheaper than Amazon for this product). Remember to overturn or hang the tub up when empty so that it doesn't get mildewy (and it will if you leave water standing in it).
When I first got it I through we don't need this until baby is older but since he is able to sit upward we are using this. He is a fast growing baby only one yr old but already bigger than many 18 months. We have five different tubs at home and both grand parents house plus a travel tubs.  So fur this is the winner. I highly recommend this!
I have had this tub for at least a year and a half now, and I still love it.  My chunk 26 month old can still fit in it comfortably.  It also worked great when he was much smaller.
This is the only tub I have ever owned, and I LOVE it!  I've tried other models when watching my friend's kids, nieces and nephews.  Of the ones I've tried I felt that the molded ones don't grow well with the kids, and the ones with padding, foam, or the slings never get as clean as you want them.  I got this one based on the reviews, and none of those things have ever been a problem.It was a little big when my baby was a newborn, but I just lined the reclining end with a small towel (rolled up a bit at the bottom to give her a boost) and it propped her up perfectly.  The grandparents didn't have a baby tub, so I had to bathe her in the sink when visiting.  I dreaded it because I was so spoiled by how easy this tub makes bathtime.  That free hand can be priceless!  I went so far as to bring it on vacation with us (for her and the 2 other babies there) - just packed a bunch of her stuff inside and threw it in the back of the car!  She is a year old now and she still fits just fine.  We lay her back to wash her hair in one end, and when she sits up she can spin herself around to the other end to play.  As a little bonus, now that she is mobile, using this tub keeps her contained.  I am not chasing a slippery toddler up and down the length of a full size bathtub!It is a definitely a big tub compared to other models, but don't let that deter you.  I went to Lowe's and bought one of those giant, locking suction cup hooks.  I stuck it to the top of the tub wall opposite the shower head.  It holds the tub, and we still have plenty of room to shower.  Our mesh tub toy bag hangs neatly out of sight underneath it, and as a bonus the toys aren't soaked every time someone takes a shower.  (The only thing with the suction hook is that if it's not locked down the tub can fall, and when it does it is LOUD!  But - lesson learned - it only takes a second to lock the hook.)I've never used the drain.  She is only a little kid - I don't think she gets so dirty that she needs a whole tub full of fresh water to rinse.  After her bath I just tilt the entire tub up to dump it, wipe it out with one of those Lysol or Clorox disinfecting wipes, rinse it and hang it up.  The only real crevice to clean out is the drain plug. The rest of the surface is smooth so it wipes down quickly.Overall, I feel like this tub is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.  We're expecting another baby and - again - we will be using this tub just as soon as this one can take a real bath!
First, this is for our 3rd baby and it's our 3rd tub. I love the fact it's big. Now when I give my 6 month old a bath, I can do it on the counter not breaking my back doing it in the tub.It's no frills, no toys, lights just a tub. I love it, it's really big and very sturdy.
This tub is great. Very well designed and extremely well made.  My son is very big for his age and yet still fits in it really well.  It is very sturdy and yet is light to carry and as our bathroom is quite small is hung on the wall out of the way when not in use.  It fits well in the large family bathtub but also on the worktop next to the sink when my back is too sore to lean over the bath.  The small plug is very easy to use too and means you can drain a little water to top it up if you need to.  I love the fact that as he gets older he can sit up at the other end and I won't have to use so much water as the large family bathtub for him for quite some time. I haven't seen a better bath anywhere.
I had a different baby tub before this because I thought this was too expensive. But my baby outgrew the one first one I bought so I ended up buying this one and I wished I bought this one in the first place!The tub is large so it holds more water. My baby loves playing in it! The newborn side of the tub is awesome. It prevents my baby from sliding.The toddler side is great too! My son enjoys sitting up and playing with his floaty toys.Don't be intimidated by the size. I have a narrow tub and was worried it wouldn't fit in it, but it fit perfectly!
I have 20 month old twin boys and they didnt really use large baby tubs (no room!) so I completely forgot how important this would be for my now 4 month old son! Thankfully someone bought me an infant tub, and thank god its this one!* The Eurobath doesnt leak on the counter, which is a god-send since it didnt fit in our double sink too well* Holds enough water to cover my baby* Has an infant side for babies who cant sit up yet (although we put a little dishtowel there for extra "gripage")* Has a toddler side for infants who can sit up, gives them some room to play* Cute color too* Will fit in the big tub when we need it there* Cleans up very easilyBUT* Its really really big and its hard to store* Theres no support to keep a baby from slipping* it wont fit in the sink* Its expensiveAll in all though, this is a great tub and by far the best available on the market, really comfortable, dont waste your time buying a cheaper model, you will just wind up buying this one anyway, if you wind up with a good tub.
It is a great bath tub for my newborn! The side for the newborns in this tub makes them feel safe since the baby does not slips so easily. It also gives a good support for the head. You can actually enjoy to give a bath to your baby by focusing more in cleaning and playing with the baby than worring about finding a way to hold him to avoid him to drown. It really facilitates the bath for first time parents.
I bought this tub after my 5 month old son started to become too big for his other infant tub.  A friend has this tub and highly recommended it.  I am so glad she told me about this tub, since it is so big and he won't grow out of it for a long time!  The tub is roomy and the grooves hold him well.  I imagine that this tub would be great for a newborn as well.  We love this tub and highly recommend it!
We chose this tub because of the molded infant side and the big toddler side.  We started using this tub when our son was three weeks old, and he just seemed so small in the tub.  A few weeks later, he flipped out of my husband's hands and landed face down in the tub, so we discontinued use of the tub until he was about 4 months old.Now that he's older, he loves it!  While lying in the infant side, he had the freedom to splash around, and I never have had a problem with him rolling over or anything- the sides help keep him from doing that.He's now 7 months old, and we've switched him to the other side of the tub.  He loves it, and the middle core keeps him from sliding around too much.The biggest setback with this tub is it is huge.  We keep it in the tub of our spare bathroom, and it takes up most of the tub.  The drain is also inadequate- it is much easier to just pick it up and dump all the water out.
This is really a great product.  We bathed our daughter in this from new born until 3 1/2.  Found it to be safe and secure as one side is more shallow for the newborn.
I works great as it has 2 sides. Start on one when she was a newborn, but then as she got older, she moved to the other side. About 2 months into it realized that the plug actually suctions to the side on the tub, so the water flows easily. It is bulky though, so you need to have space in the bathroom to store it and to use it. The Primo sign fell of within a couple of months.
this tub is a little big, but it is absolutely the best tub out there.  before my baby could sit up, it was a huge help to have both hands free to wash him.  easy to clean and will grow with the baby.  the other tubs out there are way too gimmicky
No frills, sheer elegance in design! Love this bathtub. I was looking for a simple plastic design so that the tub would be easy to clean/sanitize with no mold issues. The closest highly rated blue whale tubFisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub(like most others), while really cute, has a tendency to develop mold in hidden crevices. The PRIEuro has no crevices. I have been using this since LO was 2 weeks old. She is 4 months now and still loves it. It is quite big in size but we have ample counter space on the vanity so it works well for us. Looking forward to using this until LO is a toddler!
I got this tub on the advice of previous reviews and have to agree it's great.  It is big, I store mine on it's end in our linen closet and set it on the kitchen counter for baths.  My girls slipped around a little on the infant side until I put a burping cloth under them.  The wet fabric helped keep them in place.  My only complaint is the drain plug must have been stuck in backwards.  The force of the draining water blows it closed so I have to prop it open by sticking a pair of scissors through the hole.
I registered for this tub after doing my research and reading reviews and have only had positive experiences with it.  It's the first tub we've had, and I predict it will be the ONLY ONE we ever have. I have used it for my 3 month old since her first water bath and I have had NO problems.  It IS a large tub to store, but I don't mind since it makes our bath times so fun and easy!  My daughter just loves splashing around in it and it fits her little body so well that I don't worry about her slipping out or off of the infant rests while I bathe her.  I actually put this tub into our bathroom tub for bathtime - fits perfectly.  When her bath is finished, I simply dump her water into the large bathtub to drain and store this one away.  There is a drainage hole and pipe for easy draining if you choose to use it somewhere other than a bathtub.  There is a lot of room for her to grow also - we'll be using this tub for years to come!
Your baby will have support with this and can lay in it alone. This means your hands will be free which is great for a quick bath if your baby is like mine and cries during the whole time.
We registered for this site unseen based on the reviews.  It greeted us on the porch of our house when we arrived home with the baby.  At first, I thought a refridgerator had been delivered!  (Okay...slight exaggeration.)  But it was HUGE.(...)
My baby is one month old and we love the eurobath!  It's spacious and comfortable, he likes being in the water, other bathtubs have a seat out of the water.  It also has a plug on the bottom which makes it easy to empty.  I love that it holds an older baby too.
Bathing my infant girl has been so easy thanks to this bathtub! I started using it when she was just three weeks old, and the contoured infant seat supported her just fine.  She has never cried during her bath, even when I pour water over her head, because the seat positions her so that it is next to impossible to get water in her face or ears. She is six months old now and loves her bathtime more and more each day. She still fits comfortably in the infant seat and is able to kick and splash very easily and safely. She still cannot sit up on her own, but with my assistance I have also moved her over to the deeper side of the tub so that she can play in the water. I can already see that the tub is designed so that a baby can sit in it with the bare minimum amount of slipping and sliding. Yes, it is much bigger than most tubs, which makes it impossible to store anywhere but in your own tub or shower stall, but it is worth it, because I know that we will be using it well past her first year.
Arrived caved in from shipping. If a plastic tub can't endure shipping, how can it handle a growing toddler? I had a nightmarish experience returning through Marketplace, horrible experience for a cheap overpriced tub. I ended up ordering the hoppop bath, which I love. The PRI tub certainly wasn't worth the $50 I spent. Go to Bed,Bath,& Beyond to see it in person and pay $24.99 if you really want it. I still prefer the hoppop that I purchased through Amazon.
This tub is large, fits in the bath tub, and works very well for our daughter.  She just chills out in it while we scrub away!  It also has a plug in the bottom.  But we just tip the water out in the tub once we're done bathing her.
One thing I didn't understand when I registered for this online is that it's huge! We lived in a small one-bathroom condo when I had my first baby and it was difficult to find a place for this thing since we had to take it out of the tub every time we showered.If you have a bathroom that's just for the baby where you can leave the tub in there all the time, this tub is perfect. If, however, you bathe your baby in your own bathroom, consider getting the Sure Comfort tub that's smaller.
I used this bathtub from the day I brought my son home until he was old enough to climb out of it on his own. When he was really tiny we just put a rolled up waschloth at his groin to prop him up a bit more. But it was so nice that he could be supported but be deeper in the water. He stayed warmer and he was much more relaxed than when we bathed him in the standard baby tub at my parents house. As he got older we were able to let him splash and kick and explore so much more because the back is so supportive. Yes, it is a little large, but it has a drain in the bottom and we just stored it in the regular bathtub when we werent showering. Recommend it to all my moomy-to-be friends.
I LOVE this tub! The moulded shapes hold my baby nicely and allow me to have my hands free to bathe him properly. We have been using it since he was three weeks old and it still works well. We always lay a towel in the bottom to keep him from slipping around and for comfort. The drain on the side is a nice convenience and makes emptying it easy. The only issue is it's size, but we found that it fits perfectly under the crib and we store all of the baby toys, towels and baby bath products inside.
This is a great tub for when babies have out-grown the infant type tubs, but can't yet sit on their own in big tubs.  This tub is huge, which I was aware of..it's one of the reasons I love it.  My son who is almost 8-months, looooves the freedom this tub gives him.  He splashes to his little heart's content.  My only negative comment, is about how slippery it is.  I still have to have one hand on him at all times because he likes to reach for things and squirm and he has taken a couple headers into the water, which he didn't seem to mind, where it gave me palpitations.  It's a lot of work to hold him in place while he's kicking and splashing, while also trying to bathe him. I use a towel on the bottom of the tub to make it less slick, and it does help, but it isn't fool proof.  Once he becomes more steady, and aware of himself, it will become easier.
Used it for 1st time today. My 5 month old seem comfortable in it. We just graduated from that 1st year tub (with sling) since he look too big for the other tub.1 less star for the scratches and dirt on the tub when it arrived. But it's good after washing. Well it's a molded plastic. Nothing fancy. Very well shaped though!
We've been using this since birth for the past 4 months and it's working well. I don't really have a comparison point but no complaints. The back seems a little slippery so we put an organic cotton diaper on it as a little pad to make things more comfortable. There is plenty of room and I think we'll begin to love this more once she is old enough to sit up. For now, we get through bath without any tears or falls and that is good enough for me!
I really like this tub for my sitting baby. She still manages to swish herself around face down, despite the little barrier that sits between the baby's legs. But that's why you're never supposed to leave babies unattended in the bath. They can manage all sorts of crazy things when left to their own devices.The only reason I didn't give this tub 5 stars is because the white tub develops a little brown spot where her bum sits. I clean her thoroughly with wipes before each bath, so I'm not sure why this is happening, and she's never pooped in the tub. I've tried scrubbing it with baby-safe detergents, but it won't come off. It seems to be permanently stained. I'm too afraid to try bleach in that spot, since it's where the most sensitive part of her body rests in the tub. If I could have gotten another color for the same price, I would have.
As the previous review stated, this is the perfect tub for a tall baby. Our 24 in tall 2 month old outgrew her 4Moms CleanWater tub and we wanted to find a tub she can continue to use as she grows. She loves this tub as she can kick her feet around with plenty of room. It seems to be made well and is super sturdy, we have been using it for a month and I can see using it until she grows out of it. Yes, it is big but we keep it in the bathtub of our spare bathroom all the time so it is not an issue. If you only have one bathroom and are low on storage space, you would probably want to look elsewhere but if you have the space, this is a must!
This is a big improvement over our previous tub, which had no built-in supports - only a separate chair on which our son would constantly be sliding downward.Three places for improvement:1. There is no stand, and apparently you can't purchase one.  I built my own to elevate the tub 6&#34;-7&#34; in order to save my back.  (I don't endorse this - a poorly built stand would present its own obvious risks).  Plus I feel safer being able to reach the baby easier.2. It doesn't drain fully on its own - it must be tipped later on after the baby is out.3. The middle support piece could be taller.  For the most part, it holds my 6-month-old in the reclining position.  However, the does a full-body kick (like in professional wrestling to escape a pin), and has almost managed to throw his whole body onto the top of the supporting piece.
Newborns can be so wriggly &amp; this product was a great help at bath-time!  Especially for 1st time parents!  The design holds baby in place &amp; our 1 month old (who is almost rolling over already) stays put during bathing!  The only change to this product I'd recommend is a foam liner where baby sits/lies.  I went to a craft store &amp; bought some for cheap &amp; installed it myself (used a towel as a 'liner' the first 2 baths).  Also, it is quite large for counter-top use but we made it work in our master bathroom, too big for the kitchen.  Really a nice product, helped me feel more comfortable about bathing a newborn!Update at 4.5 months age:  I stand by my statement above in that this is a great product - IF you use it.  I have taken baby into the bath with me more often &amp; Daddy helps to dry him off when we are done.Update at 7 mos (July04): Using more now that he is bigger &amp; harder to take to the tub with me (wants to crawl in the water).  Still would have liked for a layer of foam against the back, as said above I did my own!
My son is 7 months old...we've been using it since he was approx. 1 month. We used one of those "bear" shaped bath sponges to support him a little when he was tiny, but we're still using this tub and we love it! He's now able to sit up and play in it. I can see we'll be using it for a while! It's a good investment. It is large....you'll need space to store it or in our case we just keep it in the tub in our extra bathroom! You and your baby will love it!
I have used this tub for my two kids and it is perfect for our needs.  We use it inside our full sized tub.  My son who is almost 3 still fits in it and I used it for my newnorn daughter as well.  The design really helps little ones stay upright when they are starting to sit.
I wanted something comfortable, safe, and high quality for our 4 month old.  This is a great tub for her getting ready to sit up on her own.  It is big, and takes up almost the whole bathtub, but it beats the others since it creates her own bathtub.  There is plenty of space for her to kick and play. It drains easily and easy to clean.  For the price you will get your deal, especially the end result is a happy baby :)
I received this as a gift.  I didn't use it until my daughter was 5 months.  It's wonderful!  While you would never leave a child unattended - it does provide a great deal of support.  I have a hard time getting my daughter out of the bath - she just loves being in there!  I highly recommend this item!
I had the previous version of this same tub with my older children (a hand me down). I LOVED it. Thinking I was done having children, I gave it to a friend. Several years later, chose to have another child and ordered a new tub.Improvement: This one has a plug you can pull out, rather than a tube. HUGE improvement, as the previous version was prone to mildew in the tubing, and yanking the tube to help with drainage was problematic.This tub can hold a brand-new baby. One side has what looks like a slide with sides. It actually supports the baby, and holds it to keep it from slipping. It also has a support between the legs, again to prevent the infant from slipping. Reclines a newborn slightly, since htey obviously cannot sit upright.When baby is older, seat him on hte other end, where he can sit upright.This tub fits inside any standard bathtub. I love it, works great, and recommend to every new mom!!
We purchased this tub in transparent blue. At first sight it seems HUGE. It's because the tub has two "sides". One for infants who need to lay reclined, and the other is for older babies/toddlers who can sit up with minimal or no support. Other reviews state that the drain is slow, but I wouldn't know....I use the tub inside our regular bath tub and dump it when we're finished. Our tub is stored hung on a nail on the bathroom door or turned over in the big tub. It's very ergonomic for baby and allows whoever is bathing baby to use both hands for washing. Have been using this tub for about four months and have NO complaints. Sturdy, easy to clean, easy to store, and my baby loves it! It also matches our blue themed bathroom quite nicely. Also the shipping time was great!
Our baby's umbilical cord stump fell of when she was just a few days old, so we bathed her in this tub.  She was too tiny for her arms to fit in the arm places, but it worked perfectly because she fit snugly and securely in the place that the body is supposed to go.  Baby won't slip under the water because of the plastic mouldings, so you can have both hands free to wash and reach. Once our baby was big enough to sit up, we put her on the other end (toddler end), and she plays and splashes, while still having the plastic molding so she can't slip back into the water.  She's 18 months old now and we fill the tub to the brim in the big bathtub.  This is a large baby tub, but it stores easily in the bathtub, cleans up very easily, and you will be able to use it for 2 years at least!  Well worth the extra $$.
My son is 9 months old and could be bathed in our regular bath tub without issues. However, bathing him in the tub kills my back! We have been using this tub on our kitchen counter since he was born and its the best thing. I can bathe him at a comfortable height without bending and kneeling. Now that he sits well unsupported he would rather sit, which this tub allows. But when he was a newborn he was able to lie down and be well supported. I think this tub is wonderful. It is large and spacious and I think it could easily be used well into the toddler years. My only complaint is the drain. We have to put a plastic spoon in the hole to keep it open, otherwise the water pressure pushes the plug shut while it's draining. Other than that, I absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to awkwardly bathe their child in the regular tub.
I have two children, while my younger one loves it, my toddler still hates bath time. However, this is much better and less intimidating that a regular bath. I'm hoping to find a way somewhere in here to get my toddler to enjoy bath time, currently its like war just getting her leg wet! This tub is durable, very well built, does not look cheap. Its big enough for a toddler and perfectly built inside for a smaller infant.
I purchased this after the fold away unit I had been using for the first four months just wasn't cutting it anymore.  I will start by saying this unit is BIG.  Although there is a side for newborn infants, I think they would slip around too much and the unit would be very big for a small baby.  That being said, I started using this when my grandson was 5 months old...he is now 14 months old and I use it every week and I don't see him growing out of it anytime soon.  I use the other end of the tub (not the reclining end) and it allows him to sit up and the straddle guard  keeps him from slipping.  To save my back I put this on my kitchen island for bath time and I have no problems transferring it with a few inches of water in it from the sink to the counter island.  It is very easy to clean and I just leave it in the bathtub to drain completely and store it there...when I need the tub I just take it out.  Well made heavy duty plastic will last for babies to come.  Yes it does take up some space but I hide it in the tub behind the shower curtain and I'm just fine with that,  I find that I don't use the plug as it seems easier for me just to dump the water into the sink from the long end.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.
We used this bath tub with our first son and loved it. It truly  last a lot longer than most and is very safe with infants.However, i just re-ordered one for our second son and had to return it because we now live in a smaller space and it is way too big! If you live in a small place, consider that because it is very large and difficult to store.On a side note, the packaging was beyond awful. the box was damaged, not closed...bad bad bad
This bath tub is humongous. It needs its own bath room.  Too big to put it on top of a kitchen sink.  Since the only place I found for it near water source is inside our bath tub, which places it practically at ground level, my back is killing me.Unless your are planning to remodel your bathroom to fit this monster, go for something else.  Definitely not for a 700 Sqr Foot apartment in the city.
Saved the day. Two years old granddaughter growing out of smaller infant tub. This one claims to be the biggest on the market. She fits fine in this one and has just bought her mom and dad at least another year before they have to worry about putting her in the bathtub which they now do not have.
this tub it gigantic. thank goodness i have a spare room by my bathroom to store it in otherwise i would have no choice but to send it back. it is nice & sturdy though.
I have ventured to three bathtubs (Firstyears, Safety1st, and finally Primo Eurobath) for my daughter.  Nothing is even comparable to this Eurobath.  She is having fun in it! and always looking for to bath time.  My daughter is now 13 months and she is about 20 lbs.Below is the comparison of the other bathtubs to Eurobath. With other tubs, I experiences:1. Not much room for her to grow and play in the bathtub.  And the water is just covering her buttock (not even up to her waist).While Eurobath gives her so much room to play and keep her body warm with the water that cover up to her chest.2. Too much curving that is just HARD to clean!  I need to use my toothbrush to clean up certain areas in the tub due to the molding.While Eurobath has a smooth curve that makes my cleaning time a breeze (just wipe it dry and done!).3. The infant sling I have, use a metal that finally got give away to corrossion due to its daily exposure to water for the first 6 months.  So basically it was useless!  And for the other one, it was just too narrow for the infant part.While Eurobath infant section has so much space that even my daughter still fit in there for hairwash.  No need to bother corrosion issues too!4. The toddler section is using a chair that is always too big,  my daughter almost always slipping and I need to hold her with my muscle to avoid her sliding.While Eurobath toddler section is just made ergonomically that holds her position in the water.  So less to no more chance of sliding.5. Yes I am editing ADDING this particular benefits that I noticed lately too:  Have you ever had a problem after soaping your baby's buttock then when it times to rinse by filling up the water to the bath tub, you took your baby out thinking it is well rinsed but yet noticed that the buttom of your baby is STILL soapy?  Well at least I did.The FirstYears and Safety1st that we have only cover up to my daughter's waist: if I want to clean the buttock, I need to basically pull her up to rinse it (and pulling her in those bathtubs are not easy because not too much room and not to mention she is heavy too).While the Eurobath: because it covers close to her chest, I just need to slide her around to clean the buttock.  I let the water do the work (floating/buoyancy). And with so much room, my hand can reach and clean her buttock easily.Well I could rave about this product on and on.  Glad that I purchased this product and to listen to other parents' reviews here!  Great one!
This was one of the best purchases we've made!  Our 9 week old loves baths in this tub.  He's very comfortable in it since it cradles him & I love the idea that it can be used for so long.  We purchased it directly at the store which I see was wise since shipping can be so expensive.It is very big compared to the other tubs out there, but we just store it in our bathtub when it's not in use.
This was such an upgrade from our last bath tub, my daughter is 5 months old and on the big side for height and weight. This tub is so large but in a good way. I'd just like to forewarn you do not need to put too much water into this tub since they are reclined so deeply into, and the only con is there isnt any grips on it so once your kid finds out how much fun it is in this tub they can jump around and thus slip around a bit- not bad-- but wanna keep a close eye on them.
This is the only tub you need.  It works for infants up to 3 year olds.  Our newborn uses one side and the older toddler uses the other side.  It is so multi-tasking.  If you buy a newborn tub, you will be buying this one shortly thereafter because your newborn will outgrow the small one so quickly.  Highly recommend.
This bathtub was recommended by one of my best friends, a supermom, and I am so glad I bought this on her advice!We've been using this tub since the little girl was a little under a month, and at first I needed to be more supportive of her as she'd squirm and start to slip one way or another.  But already at just 3 months she lays and splashes and plays in the little molding and we can float a duck around at her and clean her so easily as it supports her.  I love that we'll be able to keep using this bath as she grows into this little baby spa.The material is durable, the molding perfect for a little baby and the features are practical.  There is a max fill line and a little drain, though I really just flip it over after we bath her in our tub.  The biggest issue is storage - it would never have fit in our old apartment.  We leave it in the tub, flipped up to dry.
I have a deep soaking tub so i needed something that would be a bit larger. This is definitely larger. My infant daughter is still very small for the infant seat but she will grow into the space. I also like that there is a drain in the tub. would have given 5 stars if there was an insert to buy for infants. One of the other reviewers commented to buy no slip pads and this is very helpful. will be very slippery without.
This tub is bulky, but great.  It's like a real tub, and it does fit into a bath tub.  It is highly easy to keep clean.  And has two positions.  One is a reclining position for a younger infant.  In this position I would place a washcloth down before the baby to prevent sliding.  The second position is for infants to sit upright.  Great device.  Is something that could be used for years or passed to family and friends as a hand-me-down.  Well worth the price.  No mildew issues at all.
This is a great bathtub for babies. I love how the sides come up and kind of hug my baby, I don't have to worry about him rolling over in it. It is rather large and takes up most the space in a regular size tub. Its very easy to clean. I would recommend this tub to everyone.
This tub is great!  Its totally huge.  My 3 month old loves to kick and splash in the bath.  I started using it at 1 month and bath time has never been better.  I used a smaller tub to begin with because this tub seemed alittle to big for a newborn.  It has a contoured seat that keeps him from sliding down in the tub.  My baby seems very comfortable in this tub, I highly recommend it.
I love this tub, it's great for infants and toddlers.  I do recommend but it does take up alot of room.  Worth the money.  Great design!
Got this tub because my son is pretty large for his age and outgrew his spa baby tub at 4 months. he LOVES being able to lay and kick in this tub! looks like it should be big enough until he is a toddler. it fits in our bathtub perfectly.
Hands down BEST BATH EVER. This bathtub is awesome. We originally purchased a different tub, but at 4 months our baby outgrew that one so we opted to buy the PRI EuroBath. I only wish we'd bought this tub first. It is big, but its not any more cumbersome than a smaller tub. Our little man has plenty of room to splash around and he can rest comfortably in it with all of his bath toys. It is super easy to clean and a great great product. Don't bother buying the smaller tubs, go with this one!!
If you're looking for a tiny bathtub for your itty-bitty newborn baby, this might not be what you had in mind.  It's big.  It's not the sort of bathtub you plop in or on top of your kitchen sink (unless you've got a pretty big sink and you're very tall).  I actually use this inside our regular bathtub when bathing my daughter.  I used a bath cushion to give her extra support and comfort on her back/head when she was unable to sit up on her own.  And though she's able to sit up now, using this bath makes so much more sense than filling up the regular bathtub (which would require way more water).  I definitely foresee myself using this bath for my 7 month-old for several more months, and possibly a couple more years.
My son had his first bath in this tub. It's a bit large for a newborn. I had to use my forearm for support and bathe him with my other hand. The second time I used it, I used one of the mesh beds from another bath with this set. My son was in heaven.There's plenty of room in the tub. It's easy to drain. I usually drain a bit of the water mid-bath and add more water to make sure I'm getting all of the soap off.He is now 10-weeks and loves splashing his hands in the water. He looks forward to bath time.
I received the sure deluxe newborn to toddler tub at my shower, But my little girl outgrew the newborn side at 3 months, but was to small for the toddler side. Here bum would pop up over the plastic part that is suppose to keep her from going under. I  bought this tub and it is great! It is the only tub where she has been able to kick her feet and it holds her so i can bathe her with two hands. It is big, but fits perfectly in our tub and gives her so much room to play around. It has made the both of us so happy i only wish it was padded, but other then that it has been great!
after tried out 3 different tubs, i finally bought this one. i didn't want to buy this tub at the first place because it is a humongous tub. i kept trying out other tubs and kept returning them. so finally, my husband got tired of returning tubs, he picked out this one but i was still having doubt because it is so big. but, once i gave my daughter a bath in it, i knew that this is a good buy. my daughter wouldn't slip off in the tub and there is plenty of water to pour over her body and it takes less time to bath her.
Before I gave birth I received a smaller blue infant tub that is generally pretty popular and widely available. I loved it for my newborn, it was small and compact and easy to place over the sink.  However by months 3 it was clear the tub was far too small for my son, even though it claimed to be for toddlers as well.  So we decided to get this one, it is far superior to the previous one.  Though this one does not come with an newborn insert I find the tub itself is so much smoother, softer and more comfortable for the baby then the previous one.  The laying down part is still being used at 7.5 months.  I think it will probably be used for quite a while, since it is easier to lather him up in that position.  The tub itself is large but the bottom is proportioned enough to fit over a nice size sink.  I should have purchased it first.  I am very happy with it and highly recommend it for your newborn, infant or toddler.
My 3 month old daughter LOVES this tub. We originally had the First Years tub, but she grew out of the newborn hammock but was still too small to bathe without it. So she basically started having a meltdown every night because she was uncomfortable and couldn't stretch her legs out. You can imagine this wasn't good for our usual bedtime routine! Well, I read the reviews on here and went to BRU and got this tub immediately. She loved it right off the bat. She could fit in it without any kind of a sling because the tub itself is very supportive. This tub is also HUGE which means lots of water to splash in! When she first started getting to know this tub, she started kicking around frantically and made us wonder if she was panicking or having a good time. Well turns out she was just having a good time haha. She loves to splash around and kick her legs, and turn from side to side (all supervised of course). I find this tub is great for getting out her energy as well as working out a little gas before bedtime. I'm not sure if this tub would be good for a brand newborn since it is a little big, but I never tried it until my daughter was over 12 lbs.
Love this tub for my 8 month old. She had outgrown her washpod tub (which she also loved) but I wasn't comfortable putting her in the regular bath tub yet since she is such a squirmer. This tub was a hit right off. She loves it, there is plenty of room for her to splash around and it is really easy ton wash her.
I bought this tub because it received really good reviews - but it is gigantic and really takes up half of my bathroom.Also, because of it's size you don't transport it and end up keeping it in the bathtub anyway!I found it's just easier for my daughter to take a bath with me!
Once baby had outgrown the sink, we were stuck using the one I originally registered for - a "space saving" model. HATED that one. Too much work. Read reviews and bought this one - baby is now 15mos and we are still using it. LOVE it. One tip - for small infants, use one of those big sponge things to keep baby from sliding around, or put a wet handtowel behind them. Oh, and I use to store it on the back of a door. Used one of those stick-on-hooks to hold it up. Worked great, out of the way & able to dry out. Buying this for all of my girlfriends for their baby showers.
I first used this bath for my baby's very first bath at 4 weeks (she was born 6.5lbs) and it worked very well! I felt she was safe and secure while I washed her. I used a face towel to line where her head would rest. She stayed calm and loved to kick and splash and she still very much enjoys bath time. I store this in our full sized bathtub (which we do not use). When my friend gifted this to me she remarked how huge it was and then realized it was meant for toddlers too. The drain works well but I just dump the water out and let it dry standing on it's end balanced against the bathroom wall. If you fill the tub past the tushie support piece the tub will get too heavy to turn over and drain will be needed. The tub has a line that the water is not supposed to be filled past, just about at the same level of the tushie support. The inside of the tub stays clean; I do get a little mold on the underside at the end where I stand the tub up. It's easy to clean without any odd crannies and I love that it is all white and "clean" in appearance. I think this would be tough to have in a home with only one bathroom or only one tub that multiple members of the household use.
We are still using this tub after almost two years! My son loves it. Saves water and keeps the bath warmer for my little one rather than putting him in the tub with an inch of water. Eventually we will have to move on, but it was great for the money!
This tub is really nice.  The contoured area for the baby is just right, and it seems really safe.  My baby hated baths until I bought this tub, and now he is much happier.  I like this tub, but I agree with other reviewers that the drain is slow.  Also, the hard plastic is unpleasant for the baby, so I also bought the Safer Bather cushion.  I realize now, though, that I really didn't need that...a soft washcloth or cloth diaper would be enough.  I recommend this tub to anyone who wants to have good control of the bathing situation.  I feel much more at ease using this than I did using the sink because I know that my son is not going to slip into the water.
The bathtub is priceless.  I read reviews previous to registering and I was so glad that I did.  Although it takes up a lot of space and isn't very cute, it is worth its weight in gold.  It holds baby so well from the very beginning and provides the "extra hands" I need for a productive yet safe bath-time.  I can foresee us using this bath for a long-time and I recommend it to everyone I know!
This is the second bathtub we bought.  I wish it had been the first, and only bathtub!!  Our son outgrew his first bathtub by three months.  It had a baby sling, but he hated the sling.  We bought this one next, and he loves it!  He just lounges around in it, and I love that it cradles him so well so he doesn't slip!  It is very safe and comfortable for him.  I'd definitely recommend it!
We like this tub a lot. I only gave it 4 stars because it is bulky, so I don't really have anywhere to put it when my son isn't taking a bath, but we love that we don't have to fill the tup up and waste water. We always put a little towel under him so he doesn't slip. He is still in the infant side. It is great though.
When I purchased this I didn't know my son was going to be born 2 months early and be a tiny little preemie. So, I was worried that this tub was going to be too big for him. Not at all. This tub is so fantastic it kept him nice and secure in the tub for quite a long time. The tub has an area where the baby sits that separates their legs and holds them in place (of course you need to also make sure you have your hands on your baby at all times in any tub). My son always felt very secure in this tub and I loved that it really grew with him. As he got much bigger he then would sit up in the tub and had plenty of place to play with his toys. We used to put this tub on our dining room table  and it was so great because we were never leaning over and wrenching our backs - oh how nice those days were. This tub worked for my son for quite a long time (we used this until my son was a year old no problem) and it's so easy to clean and drain. Don't waste your time with other tubs, this is the one to get, it's fantastic!
With a bad back and knees I have been bathing my child in the kitchen sink so that I can stand up, but she was getting far too big for it. When I saw this and read the reviews we ordered it. The first night I used it was fantastic. No longer do I have to hold onto our slippery baby with one hand and wash her with the other which is uncomfortable for the both of us. She can lay back and calm down at the end of the evening whilst I wash her with both hands and not have to worry about letting her slip and I love that when she's a little bit bigger she can switch ends and sit up on her own. Brilliant. Love it.
I did a good bit of research when looking for a tub as I wanted something that we could use for a while with our little one.  I also wanted to use the actual tub for familiarization purposes as the little guy grows older.  This tub is perfect.  Beginning from a couple of weeks old, he has been taking a bath in the infant side of this tub.  I do put a hand towel down to keep the little man from sliding (although he still does a little), but for the most part, this tub allows me to use both hands for washing which speeds up the process.  It's also nice to have a drain plug that allows you to adjust the amount of water in the tub if you happen to put too much in.Many people don't like the size of the tub, and it is large.  It will take up the vast majority of a standard size tub (which you also have to keep in mind for storage purposes).  Our bathtub stays in our normal tub unless we have company, then we stash it in the nursery.  It's not pretty, but it works.If you are looking for something collapsible or portable, this is not the tub for you.  If you are looking for a tub that you can use in a dedicated bathroom and are focused on bathtime safety, this is the tub you've been looking for.
Someone was really thinking when they developed this tub.  It's by far the BEST tub EVER!!! Perfect for large babies and small.  I store mine in the tub.  I had another one and my baby grew out of it before I could blink.  This one will last and last.  FYI Babies r us sells it for about $10 less.
I don't know why the website will not let me have it at one star!  I DO NOT mean 5 stars!I bought the Diaper Dekor first based off these reviews online, and I hated it!!  I does not work at all. Then I got the diaper Gene and it's better but still I think it sucks. Not only do you have to buy the special liners (annoying and expensive) it's confusing to operate.  I finally just used a small trash can in my laundry room and empied it out every few days.  At least it didn't annoy me!!! :)  I am looking into the Diaper Champ now as it uses any regular trash bag.
I loved hearing all the yeahs and nahs when registering for my baby about the diaper systems. I stood with the diaper genie because of the reviews. I love it, I have no complaints. No smells, no troubles. Works GREAT! Easy to use!
I don't understand the other reviews, mine has been a wonder. My son turns 2 in a couple weeks and I don't know what I would have done without this. When he was a newborn I would empty it only when it was full. There would be this long sausage of diapers which I found hilarious. Now it isn't nearly as long... maybe 8 or 10 good wet diapers of a 2 year old who LOVES his juice. About a month ago I noticed a little odor and I used Lysol. Since then no problem and I stuck my nose in the bottom and took a good sniff. There is one thing I do differently then the directions though. After I cut the plastic liner I remove the diapers out of the bottom (careful I don't dump one out of the liner) and then I tie the knot in the end. I even feel good enough about this product to let my son then drag it to the trash, he loves helping. About the bad review on this product, are you sure you are giving a couple twists after putting a diaper in the genie? Or a really good twist and maybe a double knot at the bottom of a freshly cut liner? This is what I do every time and I only change it when I have to or think about it. One thing that took my husband a while to catch on to (and I mean a year) is when you put a diaper in to push it only to where those griper things are. This way you can get the best twist and seal it in completely. When he was a baby I use to wait until there was 2 diapers (at the start of a freshly cut liner) so they could be gripped together. Yes, not as clean but with how fast you change newborns it was never a big problem.
I used this diaper pail when I had my first daughter a couple of years ago and I did not like it at all. I thought it was very difficult to use. (until you get used to it)  It didn't contain the smell well at all. The refills were a pain to put in and like another reviewer said it twisted when it wanted to.  The lid also kept coming off of mine. I threw this out and bought the safety 1st odorless diaper pail which I find contains the odor much better.
Excellent product. With the wide opening model, the opening is the right size to shove diapers in and keep any poop that clings to the outside of the diaper from depositing on the Genie.Save on refills by putting 2 diapers into the same "sausage", then twist only twice (not 3 times as per instructions) to contain them ...Our baby is 5 1/2 months and we've used it since first coming home from the hospital. He's now on cereal and beginner fruits and veggies and despite the increase in smelly poopies, the Genie works great.To help with smells---make a compact package out of diapers by folding in half and closing up by wrapping the back with the tabs around to the front and re-securing the tabs; the newer, scented, wide-opening refills keep the smell down (much better than the older style Genie and refills); empty it every 2 to 3 days as it fills up. I sometimes use a Chlorox wipe on the inside when I empty it.We've also had no problems emptying it; just hold it above your garbage can and swing open the bottom hinge, after using the lid-mounted cutter (press down hard and twist twice). The diaper "sausages" fall into the can and you don't even have to touch them.
The Diaper Genie is great.  It helps eliminate diaper odors, thanks to the slightly powder scented bags, and that it seals off each dirty diaper.  It's convenient,  VERY easy to use, and most of all sanitary.  We'll have this thing filled to the gills with dirty diapers, and you wouldn't even know that any stinky diapers were in the baby's room!  When it is filled, just turn the knob to cut the bag, tie off, throw out, and start all over again with fresh clean bags!
Buy the Diaper Champ instead. The Diaper Genie's only redeeming quality is the fact that it closes at the top. Otherwise, it's kind of a pain in the rear. I stick air freshners to it to compensate-I think that says it all.
It's a neat idea...the problem is...the replacement bags cost too much and don't justify the convenience.  Honestly, my husband and I use the plastic bags that the daily newspaper comes in.  They are slim and hold about 7-10 diapers.  At the end of the day, we toss them out into the garage...end of story.  If you really need this kind of doodad, there is another type out there where you can use your own plastic bag...that's much better than this deal.
When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills.Once I started using something different, I realized immediately just how wonderful the Diaper Genie really was. The odor protection the Diaper Genie provides is much superior to that of the other diaper pail. When I used the Diaper Genie, my son's room never smelled. With the other product, his room smelled horribly, even when I changed it daily!And, I found that the Diaper Genie really isn't any harder to use, and that it is much more pleasant to change, since all the diapers are sealed when you open the lid.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie. Save your money and buy one the first time around. You'll have to spend a little more on refills, but your house won't smell, which really is the point behind a diaper pail.
I use this for less than 1 month: The quality of the material (plasitc) is bad and cheap, it doesnt control de odor ( the room really stinks) and it broked after a month of use, and the refills cost too much money! I definetly go with the diaper champ, better odor control, no refill bags ( use conventional kitchen trash bags).
Why does everyone think you need this thing? Of course, we thought so.  We have used it five or six times.  We ruined two packs of refills just trying to figure out how to use it.  Once we got the hang of it, we realized it's pretty useless.  It does work to keep odor out I suppose, but so does a plastic bag.Just put your diaper in a plastic bag!
It is so annoying that my son figured out how to rip these off.. but at the same time I love this product. Very soft, cushy, works great, looks nice, easy install. No complaints here! Makes me feel more comfortable with him playing in the living room : )
When our grandson started pulling up and standing, I knew it would be just a matter of time before he would find the hearth made of brick and waist high.  So I looked at my favorite shopping place and found these guards.  I read the reviews and decided to give them a try.  They were really easy to install using the 3M tape that was included.  We have had them on the hearth now for 3 weeks and they have stuck solid so far.  Reid has even used them to pull up and they have stuck.  He fell the other day and landed right on the corner, I held my breath, nothing happened he didn't even cry just went on. So I thank the makers of these guards for saving an hospital visit.  The don't stink like some people said.  They match the color of my brick so unless you look and stare you hardly notice they are there.  I am not the type to worry about how they look with the rest of my living room, I just wanted PROTECTION and they have done that already.  Thanks.
This has been stuck on my fireplace for a year without coming off (cement slab hearth).  I did have the problem with being about six inches short.  Looking at reviews recently prompted me to call Prince Lionheart about getting a short missing piece, and they offered to send me one at no charge!  I was also happy that they are one of the few companies that still seem to have their call center located in U.S.  Very nice not having language issues.
My son was able to pull this off right away.  I'm constantly retaping it to the fireplace.  When it does stay on, it's great.  Have prevented a few bruises/cuts.
These cushions seem pricey, but they were the only ones we could find to buy, and going without some type of cushion on our brick hearth wasn't an option.  My 11 mo. old daughter started to pull a piece off the other day, but then she gave up and I pushed the piece back down fine.  What I really love about this product is the color of the foam that really blends right in with our living room decor, and the foam can be easily cut to fit perfectly, which we had to do.  My daughter loves to crawl up and sit on the hearth, and in her exuberance she's tumbled off before.  This cushion has directly protected her head a few times.
We have a standard fireplace hearth (no odd angles) that is about 6 feet wide and this has worked out great.  It sticks to the brick without a problem and my 11mo old plays on our fireplace constantly.  Since we bought these from BabiesRUs He has managed to get one piece off but considering he weighs 25lbs and has been pulling at these constantly I'm only taking 1 star off.  Otherwise this is doing a great job keeping him safe and reapplying the one piece isn't that hard.I bought the brown ones and both my wife and I actually think it looks pretty good on our gray brick fireplace and brown tables.  We also bought a 4 pack of their edge guards after the first two brands we tried couldn't survive my son's curiousity.  I'm sure my kid will still find some weight to hurt himself but hopefully now it won't be a call 911 kind of hurt.
When I got my Simmons Changing Pad, this came with it free.  I'm afraid that this is going to get a poopy stain and gross me out to the point that I have to throw it away. It fits the pad great and feels much better to the skin than the plastic cover of the pad.  The terry cloth is so soft and makes the pad so comfy.I was shopping the other day and found that a division of Carter's also makes changing pad covers that will fit the Simmons pad.  They are a little cheaper, but only come in 4 or 5 colors.I read in a review for the Simmons Contoured Changing Pad that the plastic had ripped, so she had to throw it away.  I think that would be a good reason to buy one of these, because you could keep using the pad and just cover up the tear.
When I was a brand-new mom, eager to color-coordinate my baby's nursery, I bought terrycloth changing pag covers in almost every shade available. Good thing I bought so many, because each time baby oozed, leaked, squirted, spit up, fountained, or otherwise made a baby mess, I would have to carefully fit the straps back through the strap holes, then remove the pad cover, toss it in the wash, and put a new cover on. Doesn't sound like much work, but considering how many messes babies can make, changing the pad gets to be almost a daily chore. On top of that, the terrycloth just doesn't clean well, even with those special baby-stain removers and even with Shout! It's much easier (and less costly and less stressful and less time consuming) to use the bare changing pad and simply wipe down any messes with diaper wipes or with a gentle cleanser. Don't waste your money buying pad covers.
keeps baby's skin warm, rather than putting them directly on the cold changing pad surface. i have washed it several times, and it handles well in the washer/dryer.
I registered for this item because it goes with the changing pad that I chose.  I can't believe that this cover is made by the same manufacturer as the pad!  It doesn't fit well.  It has no holes for the safety straps on the pad to fit through.  I cut small holes to pull the straps through, and they were all frayed after just one washing.  In fact, the entire cover is already covered with frays and snags after only two weeks of use!  The material is rough and cheap.  My husband and I have opted for covering the pad with a clean bath towel every day.  It's softer and easier.  We will look for another option, but until we find one, this cover is not the answer!
I am pleased with the changing pad cover...It was very expensive, that is my only complaint. It washes well and remains soft.
I bought this cover because it was the only brand offered at Babies R Us.  It was nearly worthless after the first washing because of how much it shrank.  I have since bought a Carter's cover and am much happier.
These covers work great, but you need a couple.  They are a very inexpensive way of adding color to baby's room.  We have the My Little Snoopy bedroom set, which is mostly blue, but when our daughter was born we bought one of these covers in pink.  It adds a nice girl touch to her room.
I am all about ease of clean, and this cover while very easy to clean it is not optimal to place it in the drier (even on low).  With each washing it got smaller and smaller and it made the contour of the pad malform a bit at the corners.  My suggestion, don't put it in the drier and it stays perfect (learned with the 2nd one we bought).
This is probably one of the least costly monitors on the market.  Why only 4 stars?  Even for the price, I thought there were a lack of features.  For a few bucks more, you can get one with lights the flash when your baby is crying.
Not too happy with this monitor.  We thought about replacing it early on but it was ok enough to just deal with the static.  My husband became the master of turning it down just enough to tolerate the sounds but hear the baby when he cried.  We used it for 7 months, every day during naps and night, and today the power adapter quit working so the only way to use it is with the 9v battery which lasts all of 3 hours before crapping out.  So, in summary: it will work but it's not a very good product and doesn't seem to have quality components to make it last.  Would probably be a better idea to just to buy a more expensive one out of the gate since you'll be spending that amount of money anyway once you buy something to replace this one when it dies.
I got exactly what I was hoping for - a simple inexpensive baby monitor without all the bells and whistles. The transmitter is downstairs in the baby's room and the parent receiver is upstairs in the kitchen. No, the sound quality is not perfect but it is great for the price. I can't hear every breath she takes but I can hear when she's in her bed playing and I can hear when she's crying. I don't get any static.My only real complaint with this is that it takes a 9V batter (or can be plugged in) but the battery is not rechargeable. I usually have it plugged in so I can't comment on how long the battery lasts.
For the price, in a small home, it worked well.  I didnt have a need for an expensive, over the top monitor and if that's your situation too, you'll be happy.
If you want a monitor that's super sensitive, get this one. I could be laying in bed in the same room as the baby bed, and my husband will come in from another room cause he heard the baby fuss when I couldn't. I'm not kidding, the way we know when we've got it to the correct volume is when we can hear the clock ticking. I can't hear the clock just sitting a few feet away from it, but this baby monitor can hear it clear across the room.Just don't unplug the transmitter while the receiver is still on... it's LOOOOOOOOOUD static.
We've had this monitor about a year now and it works wonderfully! It's a great relief getting this one as a second monitor after our old Fisher Price Sounds and Lights monitor has had us tearing our hair out for the past three years... what a piece of junk!  This monitor works well, with no static.  Can't say muchbetter about a monitor than that! :)
Love the price, product works just as you would expect. Minimal static, no interference that I've experienced. Great that it works just like it should, and super glad that I didn't waste the money on one of the other really expensive baby monitors.
Every baby monitor on the market seems to start at $50 and most cost around $100+. I thought the more I spent the better quality. I was wrong! I purchased a fisher price baby monitor from amazon before this one and the unit died on me after 2 months of use! It turned out all the reviewers had problems with the hand unit frying after being plugged in to the socket for too long. Both of ours died after less than a month of use. We borrowed a friends who had only used theirs for a month and that one died too! Not wanting to spend another $100+ on a monitor that was only going to die after 1 month we opted for this baby monitor. Wow what a difference! We shouldn't have been fooled by the price in the first place! This monitor has been used for 4 months and it's still kicking. Here's some PROs/CONs:PROs:1. After 4 months of constant use this monitor shows no sign of dying.2. This is the first monitor we've had that doesn't pick up cell phone static!3. There is VERY little static associated with this monitor.4. We hear our baby clearly and the base unit is 5ft away from the crib and next to our white noise machine.5. Even though you are limited to 2 channels we have never picked up any conversations or other baby monitors.CONs:1. They recommended that the unit be plugged in at all times for optimal use. This means you can't walk around with the monitor. Although I remember the directions saying you can use it when it's not plugged in. We just don't use it that way because we keep the monitor in one place in the house.2. You only have one hand unit. Not a problem for us but it might be for others.3. You can only use 2 channels. I put this under both pro's and con's because while it's not an issue for us, it may be for other consumers.Bottom line is, I would buy this monitor again in a heart beat and wish I had purchased it in the first place. Sure it would be nice to see what my child is doing in her crib when she's talking to herself, but as far as hearing if your baby is awake, crying, babbling, singing, talking, etc. this monitor does the job!
It works well enough and I love that it has an outlet plug so that I don't have to run it on batteries but the sound quality is terrible, lots of static! I honestly dont recommend this item, buy something nicer, it'll be worth it for your sanity and peace of mind.
After my expensive video monitor died, I decided to go back to basics and try this one. Good enough for it's purpose.
This Monitor gets BAD interference! Very buzzy with static! I would not recommend it. I gave it 2 stars because it's super affordable ... but you don't want to buy it unless you really don't mind the interference and constant buzz.
I read lots of reviews before purchasing this monitor. My grand daughter is now 11 months old and I watch her during the day while her parents are at work. During the day she takes two naps. She always wakes happy but before the monitor I did not hear her until she cried. Now I am able to clearly hear when she wakes and begins playing with her crib toys and am able to respond before she becomes stressed. Also I know exactly when she drifts off to sleep. There is occasional static but it is very low. My daughter-in-law spent a lot more money for something not nearly as good. In my opinion for the money this is the absolute best product on the market hands down.
I got this moniter for free after purchasing a playyard from Babies R Us..  I  had my reservations (it was free??), and read several bad reviews, but when my son came home and I set it up, I was impressed!I've had absolutely no problems with static and I can go anywhere in my home or yard and can still clearly hear my baby breathing and the quiet television in the background.I was thrilled that it turned out great... and it was free!
I owned one of these 5 years ago and it worked reasonably well, so got another one this time around (previous one was given to my SIL).  I don't know what they've changed, but this one is bad enough I'm going to break down and order something else.  We've had trouble finding an outlet we can use that doesn't have other major interference (like if the alarm clock or toaster is on the same circuit).  Plus, for some reason we're picking up another kid and their family that is no where around us (no babies within 2 houses in any direction).  I can't imagine what they've heard us say based on what we've heard!  Going to replace it with the V-tech which is less than twice as much...wish I'd put the money into that to begin with.
This monitor is your basic monitor. It does all the things that any normal monitor would do. No frills. I use it as a stationary monitor in the bedroom. It's crystal clear and is a great buy, if youre looking for an inexpensive monitor.
We bought this because my 2 year old lost the cord to our old monitor.  This is a cheap monitor that does the job.  If you are looking for crystal clear & no interference then you will have to spend more than $16.  It does have some occasional interference, but you just move it a little or switch the channel & it is fine.  It also has some "white noise" in the background much of the time, but it's minimal.  It is a cheap, simple monitor that works well.  It fit our budget & our needs and I have been happy with it.
This baby monitor has amazed me. When I was pregnant I lived in a tiny apartment where there was no need for a monitor, but I put the most basic, inexpensive one I could find on my registry for when we went to grandma's house. I didn't have high expectations.Well, since then, grandma ended up moving into a 4900 sq ft house, and baby and I lived with her for a month. I used this monitor every night and it never went out of range even in a house that big (at that point my daughter wouldn't sleep without music on, so I knew since I could still clearly hear her lullaby CD that it was working just fine).After that, I moved into my current 2600 sq ft home, and this monitor has performed beautifully. It doesn't pick up any interference even with 2 different wifi networks in the house (linksys and netgear) and it has seriously taken a beating. It has been sat on, dropped on concrete, rained on- and this morning I even dropped it in a puddle while taking photos in my backyard! As I pulled grass out of the AV port, it was still fully functioning! I am seriously impressed by this product and the value is unbeatable.
no plastic-leaching worries from these bottles due to potential dangers of #7 plastic bottles that most plastic baby bottles are made of. i was also surprised at how affordable they were. the item was shipped quickly. my only slight complaint is that i wish these came with silicone nipples instead.also, my opinion is that there's no need to buy a 4oz bottle since babies will quickly grow out of that stage. if you're short on money, just get the 8oz ones - you'll be holding the bottle when feeding a baby who can  only consume smaller amount of milk, so no need to worry about the larger size for the baby.
I use these to pump into and then to store the milk in the fridge. If I'm pumping to freeze, then I store in the Dr. Brown's bags. Glass bottles are fantastic- they're the absolute best for preserving your milk, easy to boil and sanitize, great price, and they can go in the dishwasher. I would definitely have directly bottle fed my daughter with these, but she absolutely refused any bottle, that didn't look and feel more like mama. However, my best friend has EBF three babies for a year and all three took to this bottle no problem, when she returned to work each time. So, I'm hoping that when my daughter's older she may take to them (she's only 3 months) but in the meantime, I use the lansino moMMa bottles for feeding, and she has no issues with those. Also, if you've ever had coca cola in a glass bottle versus coca cola in a plastic bottle, you can definitely appreciate how glass preserves the flavor- ijs
We used Avent with our first child, and had that for our daughter too. However, she had a lot of issues with gas so we tried different bottles. After asking around we landed on these, and were thrilled. She uses a medium flow nipple at 10 months, and she hardly has gas issues anymore. That being said, if you can check out local stores as they were half the price of what they are here on Amazon. I love you Amazon, but your prices are getting steep.There has been one bottle that got a crack in it, but I even dropped a bottle on to our concrete floor and it did not break. Also, for formula these bottles are very narrow in the neck. I ended up making my own funnel with an old breastpump attachment, which makes it a lot less messy.
I bought these glass bottles after reading all the articles about bispenol A.  My daughter was used to the Dr. Brown's bottles and could not get used to this classic bottle.  She got so much air when she sucked on the bottle, we could not use it.
We didn't want The Boy drinking his milk out of any leechy, plastic-y material so we bought these. The size is right and they feel strong and secure. These are not the type of glass bottles that will break when your baby squeezes their little hands around the bottle. Those are not the kind of glass bottles you would want to buy.Lucky for you, this is not that kind of glass bottle. You'll be happy you got these and so will your baby.
these are good quality, and do not leak (as long as the nipple is positioned properly over the bottle opening, which is so easy to do). I take them out of fridge and put under hot water and so far (3 months of use) no cracks.
I purchased these bottles for our new baby. I like how durable and easy to sterilize they are also replacement nipples are very affordable also. I like the idea that because the bottles are glass we will be able to use them for future children with the minimal cost of nipple replacement. I am happy with how sturdy they are and have no fear of breaking the glass at all.
It's inexpensive and glass - EXACTLY what I was looking for!  Don't have to worry about scary plastic chemicals.  Great product!!!
My baby still has a tiny tummy, so these small bottles work well for the amount of pumped milk he can drink at night. Sturdy bottles, bottle nipples work well too.
I bought these at Target for my 9 month old. We were using the disposable liners in a bottle holder. I got to thinking about all the plastic in her life, and the lack of plastic in mine. I know it's super easy to buy plastic bottles, toys, cups, even some lotions have plastic in them. I think a little "safe" plastic here and there is O.K., but I'm trying to avoid extreme exposure. I've read some literature on plastics, and it seems like no one really knows for sure if any of them are 100% safe. I just didn't want everything in her life to be wrapped in plastic.These bottles are great. I paid $9 for 3 bottles and 3 fast nipples. The liners I usually have to buy every month and dispose of are $8! I thought we'd give these a try. My daughter is not a picky gal, she's extremely easy going, so it didn't surprise me she took to these just fine. Yes, it's feeding in a vacuum. But at this point, it's either that or have her eat out of plastic all day. It took her a few tries to figure out how to let the bubbles out but she's doing great. They clean up nicely in the dishwasher, and I just bought a large glass "milk" bottle for mixing and keeping extra formula in.They're solid bottles, heavier than her plastic ones. I wondered if she'd be able to hold it, but she did! She just took a few breaks during feeding time. Great purchase for an older baby, I'm not sure how a newborn would do with the feeding in a vacuum, especially if breastfeeding...but we didn't go that route, so I can't say.Oh, and no leaks for us so far.
I knew even before I was pregnant that I wanted to use glass bottles- I don't believe that BPA-free means "safe," so I wanted to use something I could trust. These bottles are great (they come in two sizes; this review is for the larger, 8oz size). I freeze milk in them and defrost them in warm water and we have never had a crack or break yet. They wash better than plastic bottles because you can see the fat from the milk left on them when they are still dirty- it's hard to see that in the plastic bottles. They are easy to clean and not too heavy, but still strong enough to freeze/thaw multiple times. My daughter was able to hold them herself (of course we hover while she does that) and drink a bit when she was just a few months old, so they are not these huge and bulky bottles. Good quality and better safety.
These bottles are super good quality. I recently switched to them and it's so nice to be able to leave my baby's water in the car and not have it get plastic in it from the bottle. My baby loves these bottles. I bought some nipples for older babies but didn't have to use them because she likes the ones that came with these bottles even though she's 20 months old. I just use them for water (I don't like sippy cups). I don't know why someone said these bottles leak because I've never had a problem. It's great that they are making glass bottles again these days- finally the world is wising up and getting healthier!
These bottles are great! Bisphenol-A chemical free, unlike most plastic bottles. Much healthier for babies, less expensive, and easier to clean than plastic bottles.  My son refused to drink from the latex nipple, so I purchased some replacement silicone nipples from Target for about $3.  Glass bottles are hard to find in stores, so this is a great Amazon find!
These are a great price when you compare them to others online or at the store.  They are just what we needed.
Don't plan to carry these around in a bag, because they leak. Also, it's very hard to get the top off of the part that screws on and holds the nipple, it keeps getting stuck and you have to pry it out.
These bottles are great, and I had a hard time finding them in stores around me.  They do not seem to give her any problems with gas.  I like that they are glass (BPA free), easy to clean and very affordable.
None of my kids use bottles anymore, but when they did I went through so many brands and types of bottles trying to find one that I liked. My final choice was to settle on these glass bottles. They last so much longer than the plastic bottles. All of the plastic bottles that I tried got to a point where no matter how well I washed them, how hot the water was, even going through the dishwasher didn't get the formula smell out of them. Glass bottles are so much easier to clean, and so much easier to run through the dishwasher. Plus, in the diswasher the plastic bottles were never completely dried in the drying cycle. Not a problem with glass bottles.
First off, I really appreciate the fact that these bottles are made of glass, as opposed to plastic. We try to limit food and beverages consumed in plastic. These aren't fancy and are a great price. You can skip the 4oz bottles and just get a bunch of 8oz ones. Your child will eventually use just the 8oz ones and in the mean time, you can just fill them up with 4oz.While they are great, the rings and nipples may need to be replaced. They are not expensive though, so it's not a huge problem. Our daughter however did not like these as much as the Playtex drop ins. She really had a hard time sucking them. She would have to stop drinking and we would have to wait for all of the air to flow back in before she could continue. Maybe we just had faulty nipples. I'm not sure. I would be willing to give them another try though with our next child.
It'll be a few months before we put these bottles to use but I wanted to clarify a point about replacing the nipples and dishwashing.  These bottles represent the "old standard" so only the vented "original NUK" and Evenflo nipples will fit and presumably work well without collapsing.  The current trend (Avent, Playtex natural, Gerber etc.) seems to involve wide mouth bottles and thus nipples with larger diameter rings.  The difference, if you compare the older versus newer style nipples side by side should be fairly obvious.  I only mention this here to clarify that options may be limited and to be careful if ordering nipples online.Update:  Last night, I washed the included latex nipples in the upper rack of the dishwasher and found that they came out discolored.  Some websites will indicate that the nipples themselves are dishwasher safe.  I think the discoloration indicates that some damage has occurred.  I wasn't even using the high heat (sanitizing) option!Oh well... good thing we intend to use these bottles primarily for the storage of expressed breast milk.  I'm following other reviewers' suggestions to get the Sassy (MAM Assure Ultivent) BPA-free plastic bottles for trips outside the home and for supplemental feeding.
This mattress pad is soft, but not too cushiony.  Also, the waterproof element is located INSIDE the pad, so you don't have too much of the annoying plastic/vinyl rubbing sound or feel.  The pad has protected our mattress from many a baby attack.
I use this pad in my sons crib on top of his sheets to prevent the sheets from getting stained/soiled too soon. I also use it as a changing pad as well.  They're large enough to nearly cover an entire crib sheet, and they're easy to clean.  Put it in your laundry, and dry on low setting.  I suggest buying 2-3 of these, so you have extras when it gets dirty.
I like this mattress pad cover b/c it's much easier to put on than the Evenflo one I have.  My Evenflo one you have to tug, pull, and stetch to get it on and even then it's not on perfect, a real pain.  It does &quot;pill&quot; a little after being washed, but it doesn't concern me, you put a sheet over it anyway.  My 5 month old daughter's diaper has leaked a couple of times overnight and the mattress stayed dry, that's all I need!
My mattress is water proof plus I do not use it to change diapers.  I threw mine out.
THESE ARE A MUST HAVE!  THEY PROTECT THE SHEETS FROM OVERNIGHT ACCIDENTS.  MY SON IS IN CLOTH DIAPERS AND SOMETIMES HE WAKES UP WET (NOT SO OFTEN NOW THAT WE FIGURED IT OUT:)) AND NEVER ONCE HAS IT LEAKED THROUGH THIS PAD.  IT HOLDS UP GOOD IN THE WASH AND IS DRYER SAFE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
After 1.5 years this is still in great shape! I only bought one and it has lasted through tons of washes! This is all you need! Don't go with the costly ones with this one works great!
They don't hold up great in the wash, but it is no big deal since they are used under the sheet anyway.  They serve the purpose, but just get &quot;pilly&quot; after a couple washings.
these are the only nipples my baby will take, besides mommy's.  They are very hard to find.. and I don't know why since it seems I am not the only mommy who is looking for them.  I wish Amazon would offer them with free shipping !!!!!*hint* *hint*
My son was nursed until 12 months. He didn't really take a bottle well until he was weaned. Now this is the only nipple he willingly uses.
These are about the only nipples that my little one will drink from. They are no where to be found in the stores so I was happy to find them here on Amazon.
we tried these nipples after using the Nuk orthodontic latex nipples because we needed to step up the flow and Nuk doesn't make their nipples in anything other than a slow flow (at least, i couldn't find them if they do). however, my breastfed baby did not like them. the base of the nipple looks more rounded in the images than it is--it's actually quite flat. we found that our son preferred something he could put his whole mouth around, as it would more closely resemble nursing. these nipples were a no-go. we ended up just making the hole bigger in the Nuk nipples and that seemed to do the trick. it's too bad Nuk doesn't make a medium flow nipple, but these definitely were not a good alternative.
Extend the life of your Avent's product.Now, I can continue to use all the Avent bottles!
Bought this for my little baby, who seems to like it much. Very good quality material. Can't recommend this nipple enough.
I really like Avent's versatility; the nipples, spouts, cups, bottles and handles can all be used interchangeably.I don't like the way they classify their nipples.  Each nipple has 3 classifications.  I wish they would only use one classification system because it can be quite confusing if you go to buy different nipples.1.) flow2.) baby's age3.) a numberAlso, the title of the item doesn't say what age or number of nipple this is, and there currently isn't a description.FYI:They are number 3 for 3+ months.
THis Phillips AVENT BPA free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2 pack works exactly as advertised.  Happily using it in our home.
These are our daughters favorite. They are very nice, we have a lot of them Level 1 and Level 2 and we haven't had a single problem with any of them. They are sturdy, none have broken or ripped.When you're ordering it can be a little confusing which size you are getting be sure to look at the size chart they provide to be sure you are getting the size you want.
Los productos avent son los mejores para darles biberon a los bebes, son de muy buena calidad y excelente precio, siempre recomiendo esta marca.
Order these for my newborn when the 2 hole nipple flowed too fast.  Product is just has expected - high quality.  Both my kids liked these nipples.
Any bottle nipple, no matter the hole size, is going to be too fast for a breastfed baby - even this one at first. BOTTLE NIPPLES give baby CONSTANT FLOW, whether they're sucking or not. On the breast, however, baby has nearly full control of how much and how fast milk comes out. It's why the Ameda breast pump (Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump) gives you a 'Cycle' option. You start out fast - just as your baby does when they first latch on - to allow for the milk let-down. Then, you switch to a slower cycle motion to get the most milk out - just as your baby would once they started feeding. On a bottle nipple, if baby starts fast, of course they're going to have issues at first, until they slow down their sucking motion.I regret buying the MAM bottles (MAM 3-Pack BPA Free Bottle, Boy, 5 Ounce) after I learned how easy the Avent bottles are. The MAM bottles work as intended, but are unnecessarily troublesome. When it came time to send my baby to day care for my return to work, I discovered just how frustrating the MAM bottles are. First of all, you have to make sure the bottom is screwed on **REALLY** tight, otherwise the water used to heat will mix with the contents of the bottle. This turns into such a pain - literally - when it comes time to take the bottle apart for washing. This extra thick, screw-on bottom makes warming the contents extra long compared to other bottles, such as Avent. Once you finally do get the milk warmed and take the MAM bottle out of the hot water, you have to be very careful not to burn yourself or your baby with the steaming water that collected in that screw-on bottom through the vent holes. Banging it out doesn't get all of it and makes too much noise for all those night time feedings or anytime for that matter. Using a wash or burp cloth to protect yourself and baby is yet another added hassle and one more thing to maneuver while trying to feed the baby.None of these issues exist with the Avent bottles. An extra ring is nothing compared to the base parts of the MAM bottles. Popping the lid on and off the Avent bottles is also another easy thing compared to MAM. When you're juggling a crying baby and a bottle at once, it's not convenient to have to use a counter edge to pop off a bottle's lid, but it's something I've had to resort to, unfortunately. Avent's lids are secure enough and prevent leaking without requiring a 2-hand operation.As an added bonus, Avent has a conversion kit that allows me to pump using my Ameda Purely Yours electric breast pump directly into any Avent bottle.
I thought I need to change the nipples since my baby is already 100 days old :P. But after trying size 3 for four times, I'm certain that this size is too big for him. Yes, he drinks really really fast by using size 3, but he dripped three times more than when he's using size 2 nipples. So I switched back to size 2 for now. Don't get me wrong, I like Avent nipples and I'm sure size 3 will work just as well as size 2 in the future, but perhaps it shouldn't be labeled as 3 mo+.....
I used the Phillips bottles when my son was still drinking from bottles and bought some of these extra nipples as the others eventually wore out.
This is quite ingenious!  I don't know if any other manufacturers have them, but they are such a great idea.  Instead of a hole there is a slot in the top.  Around the side are the marks I,II and III.  You line up the marks with the baby's nose and that dictates how fast the flow of milk is. This teat allows a thicker liquid to flow through so you can add rice or another cereal of your choice if you need to.  My baby is in the 90th percentile and at 8 weeks old Milk just wasn't enough.  I put 1 tablespoon of rice in with 4 ounces of milk initially and then later on increased that to 2 tablespoons (all with doctor's approval).  It is a much thicker liquid but flowed through this teat easily.  I highly recommend these.
Have used this product with last baby I had and its always been effective and never any issues of any kind.
my child seems to like these i have no problem with them except they seem a lil hard and large also the seal on the bottle has started to get leak.
Since using these nipples my daughter has had considerably less colic. They are strudy and long lasting and you can purchase them in different stages so that the nipples never get old because before they are worn out its time to change them. These are also a lot thicker than normal nipples, they are of a higher quality but they only fit avent bottles.
After trying a few bottles, I went to avent and never went back. The nipples are great. I used them with both my sons.
We were looking to replace our worn out nipples and these were the exact same ones that came with the original bottles!
New parent here. These do not work with our Avent bottles. Who knew there were slightly different sized nipples. Annoying. Have to return and replace.
Best price around! Almost half retail! Love it! These bottles work great for my baby and her gas and colic issues.
So I do really like our Avent Classic Bottles, even with the 5 parts and the occasional leak.  I recently bought the Medium Flow Nipples, since our baby is 3 1/2 months.  I think these will be great in another month, and are too fast for the moment.  Overall, the Avent bottle system is great and I would recommend to others.
These nipples are well made and do exactly what they should. Avent is a stellar brand that I have purchased time and time again.
I've tried a few different bottles for feeding my children who are also breast fed.Avent seems to work the best for me.The low flow means that baby still loves to feed &#34;direct from the source&#34; but is shaped in a way that there doesn't seem to be any nipple confusion.They clean very easily.  I usually hand wash with mild detergent and hot water though I also put them in the dishwasher on occasion.
I live in an area where it's hard to find anything.  Every store had stages 2 and 3, but I had a hard time finding the size 1.  It did come fast and do the job.  I only wish I was able to use the coupons I had!
The avent nipples are our babies favorite, 6 months flows really fast, the 3 month (3hole) is what we still use at her 6 months. If you use cereal, you will need the 4 hole (6month) to get done in a resonable time!!!!formula normal eater= 3 hole (3 month)Formula slow easter= 2 hole (entry)Formula normal eater with Cereal= 4 hole (6 month)Our girl eats formula, and cereal with veggies anf fruit. she does not get cereal in the bottle, as it took to long, but when she is ready to eat quickly we will go to the 4 hole (6 month)nipple.All in all, beast the rest, buy the best!!
We started out with the Size 1 AVENT nipple and then when our son was around two months we switched to size 2 and once he got to be around 3.5 we moved him to size 3. It definitely has a faster flow than size 2 and he is able to take his bottle a lot faster. It took him a little time to get used to the faster flow, but he does fine with it now (five months old). I don't plan to move up to a size 4, I'll just stick with the size 3 until he is weaned. Our son is exclusively formula fed.
We introduced a bottle to my son when he was 3 weeks old.  This is the first and only bottle he has tried.  He took to the Avent nipple right away.  Since he is breastfed, I am still using the #1 flow nipple in order for a slower flow.  He has no issues drinking from it even still.
MY LITTLE BABY LOVES THIS NIPPLES....I EXPEND TWO MONTHS BUYING DIFFERENT KIND OF NIPPLES AND BOTTLES AND FINALLY!!I FOUND THE PERFECT BOTTLE AND PERFECT NIPPLE
These nipples work great with all of the avent bottles I own.  New to being a parent it is great to be able to change out the nipples when a new flow is needed or the nipples are wore out rather than having to buy new bottles.
These nipples are FANTASTIC!  I haven't seen them in stores and I was a little hesitant to buy but the good reviews were hard to resist.  My doctor said I could start my daughter on rice cereal at 4 months.  Spoon feeding was NOT cutting it.  I had heard of people putting holes in the nipples of bottles to allow the rice cereal to move through, but you run the chance that you can't control the flow.  So I purchased these and replaced the nipple that comes with the bottle.  LOVE IT!  She is no longer wanting to eat every 2 hours.  She also is actually NAPPING longer.  I know it's a myth but I have noticed a slight difference!A few things you MUST remember when using rice cereal1) Experience shows mixing rice cereal with breastmilk you will have a thinner mix.  As it sits gets thinner.  Formula allows for a thicker mixture.2) If your baby can't handle the flow of the liquid, don't blame the nipple or the bottle.  Blame the thickness of the mixture.  Add more rice to thicken to slow down the flow.  Rule of thumb is 1 TBSP of cereal for 4 oz of BM/Formula.  Now remember # 1 above, BM is thinner!3) Avent bottles:  Biggest complaint is leaking.  Have I had this happen to me?  Yes.  Have I fixed it?  Yes.  If you look at the nipple, there is a small seal at the lip of the nipple which is what PREVENTS leaking.If you're bottle is leaking?  Unscrew and try again.  Test it by shaking the bottle over the sink (this saves you from messy babies!).If it STILL leaks, then I suggest you need to replace the nipple and/or a new bottle screw ring.Great thing I just found was these bottles?Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Bottles, Pink, 3 PackThere is an extra valve ring to help seal.If any of my bottles leak, I follow the steps above.  Never had it leak twice in a row on me.  I have used Avent bottles with my son (2) and my daughter (4 months).  With him I got frustrated about the leaking UNTIL I found someone else's review sharing this information.  Please keep it in mind.  As with all products, there can be "user" error at times.  I am sure some leaking is the actual bottles fault, defects do happen.Also, why Avent?  You can convert the bottles to a sippy cup with ease.  LOVE THAT FEATURE!I don't use Avent bottles for "newborns" until like 1-2 months old (also I have established breastfeeding on both my children) so I can't speak to the size 1 flow nipple until that time period.  I love the playtex dropins bit more expensive overall but I have NEVER had a leak, plus clean up is a snap if you are a VERY busy mom like myself!Best of luck on bottle feeding!
These nipples are perfect if you add cereal to your baby's formula or breast milk.  We tried so many different nipples and even tried to cut a bigger whole in other nipples and the flow was too fast.  I've used these on two of my babies and would recommend them to anyone.
Good product, usefull!!! Buy it if you are looking for quality to your life; soft and easy to use it.
I purchased these because the regular nipples on my wide-neck Dr. Brown bottles have too fast of a flow for my 3 week old (side note: these fit the Dr. Brown's wide-neck bottles perfectly). These Avent #1 nipples have the same problem: they are just too darn fast. My son choked on the milk from his bottle when we used these because the milk was pouring into his mouth. I see that some other reviewers with newborns have loved this nipple.  I guess every infant's needs are different.
We like Avent brand nipples bc they are durable and not overly flexible. My son is teething and these nipples hold up well amidst his chewing/gumming. Nipples are not as flexible as other brands (Playtex for example) which helps against excess dripping when my son wolfs his formula down. These do seem to be a slightly slower flow than other medium level nipples however. We have &#34;up sized&#34; Avent nipples quicker than other brands. These nipples also seem to work well w my son's reflux. Will continue to purchase.
Great price! I wish I would have ordered several more packs. I wish they were sold in a bigger quantity pack besides 2 or 50. I needed 8 and ended up getting a few more later
This bottle nipple is great in quality and all, come on it is just that, good flow! Philips avent medium flow for 6 months was such a big help, she start to drink fast.
I have been using the Nuby Feeding Set, the bottle with the Nuby set is what I have been using to feed my 5 month old who is currenlty eating 5 tubs a day of baby food. I can't find them anymore where I live and to be honest was not to pleased with the product, since the bottle is small you can only fit like half tub of baby with an ounce at most of formula with it. Never failed it would leak and make a mess everytime I used it but since it was the only way of feeding my little one I put up with it. Then I found these and since my son has being using the Avent Classic bottles since he was born I figured I would try it. I'm so glad I did! I tried other nipples from Avent but they wouldn't allow the baby food to flow out of the nipple and he would get frustrated easily. These allow for the perfect flow, they have a I, II, III on the nipple which you can decide what flow works for best for your little one. All you have to do is line up the I, II or III with the bridge of the babies nose so no need to reposition nipple by taking it out just simply turn the bottle (I did call the Avent help line to make sure I was doing this correctly). These nipples are interchangable with the entire Avent Classic line so I just use a 9oz bottle and fill it with the tub of baby food and 2 to 4 ounces of formula and my baby is happy as can be. I can't say enough about these nipples and the Avent line, wonderful product!
This is my son's favorite bottle because it's easier for him to hold. Glad to buy the upgraded replacement nipples for his age range to be able to continue to use them.
I like that I can just buy these and not have to also buy the bottles.  These were a good transition from the lowest flow.
My almost 4 month old baby loved this. Sometimes he can take the 3 size but this one is the most comfortable with.
Do yourself a favor and save some money. If your old nipples don't seem to have enough flow for your baby anymore, get a needle and make a few more holes into it. If still not enough, make a few more OR make a couple with a hot needle. That is all it takes.
Perfect for juices and nestum. The variable flow really works. I use it with my first daughter and with my little ones too.
We've been using Avent bottles/nipples since my daughter was born two years ago, and been very happy with the quality. Their customer service is also fantastic.
Love these! They are easy to install and give me so much more peace of mind knowing that if my kiddo were to climb up the bookcase or his dresser- they are secured to the wall and couldn't fall and crush him.
We purchased these straps for four bookshelves lined up on a wall just a bit longer than the shelves. I'm sure if we had been installing one piece of furniture, moving it to the left or the right to attach two straps to the studs (or each shelf had been significantly wider) there wouldn't have been any problem, but for our setup it didn't work. The only thing that worked for our shelves was centering each in front of one stud and hooking one strap to the back. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any other options that didn't involve using a stud (I anticipated this problem). These looked like the best and sturdiest option while also remaining slightly flexible. We have had them attached to the wall for about a week now and they seem as though they'll do the job!
I feel these are more durable that the plastic zip tie looking ones.  I also like how I can easily adjust or unhook the straps if needed.
These straps come with easy to follow instructions.  They are durable, relatively discrete (white is a good color choice), and they give use the peace of mind that our toddler cannot tip the furniture.  We'll be buying more.
just what we needed. my 24month old is just starting to climb and we have lots of tall dressers and shelves. plus we live in CA, so this is a win-win for everyone!
I had incredible difficulty installing these and had to give up and return them after the screws that came with them kept breaking. I followed the instructions carefully, drilled pilot holes, etc., and I still had difficulty. I am returning all of these in favor of angle braces. This is ridiculous.
These were easy to install and I don't see how a piece of furniture with two of these could fall over - without taking the wall studs with it. I especially liked that the furniture half and the wall half come apart for installation, makes life much easier. I didn't need to predrill either (I know you're supposed to, but most of us don't).
Be aware when purchasing that the photo shows 8 but there are really 8 pairs if you order that selection.That's twice what we needed but they are super sturdy and the hardware is excellent.I'm only dinging it because of the misleading photo.
We finally broke down & secured all the furniture to the walls recently.  We had the brackets from that came with the furniture (mostly ikea stuff, but some other brands as well) & 1 set of these.  We ended up buying 2 more sets of these since they're much better than the stuff that usually comes with the furniture (& definitely much better than the ikea standard ones).  Much easier & much more secure.
They work really well. Husband says they were easy to install and didn't take that long. They hold everything to the walls and you don't see them which is an added bonus.
I bought 3 types of furniture straps so that I could compare them. This one is the best!! Very Sturdy plastic. Well made!
So I really like that this gate is a walk through and doesn't have to be screwed into the wall.  Beware, there are still quite a few draw-backs.  The first one is that it's difficult to install.  You twist and twist and twist all four of the touch points, and if you don't do it just right, the gate will be wonky or pop out of the wall.  My son has pulled it down several times because I cranked and cranked, but I still didn't get it quite tight enough.  Also, the two touch points on the bottom for some reason fall out of the gate when it's not installed, so if you're storing this gate or not using it all the time, it's super easy for one of those things to fall out in a closet or something, a toddler to walk off with them, and then never see them again, and then your gate is wonkier than ever.  This gate does not work at the bottom or top of stairwells well at all, but is pretty decent in standard doorways.  With stairs, it's difficult to get it level and tight between a banister and a wall, especially because banisters don't have a lot of flat space for the touch points, and secondly the step pedal often ends up not on a step, and so when you step on it, it can pull the gate down again!  It seems like now a gate that installs permanently would have been a better choice, but I got it for my mom's house so she can just put it up while we're in town and take it down for the rest of the year.
It's been less than a year and now for some reason we're having a really hard time closing 2 of the 3 gates (the ones weuse most often).  Not sure why this is, but we have to bang really hard to get the gates to close.  We tried fiddling around with it, reinstalling, but still stiff and hard to close.  We have another Dreambaby automatic closing gate that was not that great to start with but that at least performed the same for 4 years.Original Review:First of all, love Amazon.  My 2 gates arrived in one day with prime shipping!This really is the best doorway gate you can buy.  Very sturdy, easy to install, even comes with a wrench!  I have had several other gates (ones I bought and hand-me-downs) and this is by far the best because 1)it stays open when you don't need it (like when kids are napping) - i used to have to tie my other one open!  2)It is also nearly impossible for a toddler to get through because you need downward weight to open it.  3) Other tension gates I have (dreambaby extra wide gate) worked fine, but it was really tough to get it just right so that both parts latched/locked correctly without being so tight that it wouldn't latch.  This one was a breeze, as long as it is tight, it works, latching perfectly in both places.I have the older version of this gate and it is much better than the newer version.  It had an actual knee plate and it had a wide, sloped base which seems to provide more stability and prevented toes from kicking into the base.  The Amazon photo is incorrect and one of the pics shows the older version, which they do not seem to make anymore.  Even with the changes for the worse, I think this is still the best doorway gate out there and well worth the money.
I bought this product as a dog gate for my boston terrier puppy.  I love the step feature.  Our other gate I was having to step over each time and it was a real pain.  This gate is also quite tall which is nice.  The installation was simple and unlike the gates that drill into the wall, this gate does not leave holes and can be moved easily.  Great gate, great value!
I bought this gate yesterday.  Unfortunately it did not work in my very unusual doorway.  One thing I did notice was that after I put it together, my 2yr old daughter happened to be watching, she immediately knew how to open the gate!  Even if it did fit I still would have had to return it since she knew how to open it.  Great gate for younger children/pets.
We put it in a doorway that we walk through constantly, I can open it with no hands (i.e. holding the baby)  It keeps out the dog (about 65 pounder) and withstands some jail bar style shaking from my 1 year old.  I can leave the gate open, walking through is a bit narrow for my wide hips, but I don't have to turn sideways or anything.Get it, you won't regret it.  looks nice, easy to install, keeps out the dog and the baby in!
This is a fantastic gate! it was very easy to install - I did it myself in under 10 minutes.I love the idea of the pedal, who wants to mess with handles when your hands are full?I did read some negative reviews before purchasing this gate but most of them seem like user error... it clearly states in the instructions that this gate is not to be used on stairs.
Nice and sturdy! Easy to install and use. It has hands-free opening so its good when you have your hands full like I always do. This gate wont budge when it is installed so it is very safe. It looks nicer then some of the other gates on the market.We still have this years later and got a second one when we moved. My oldest is almost 4 and she still cant open it on her own. She isn't heavy enough for the peddle. Still loving it!
This is a great gate.  Very sturdy and easy to open.  I will definitely get another one if I need one for my other rooms!
We love this sturdy, easy gate. It works best in a doorway that you want closed off for sure. It's not so easy to take up and down quickly.
This thing has now survived up to two 90th percentile twin 2yo boys yanking on it day after day.  I bought an incline stoop thing for the bottom, and I did put a couple of screws in the door frame where the top compression feet meet just to keep them from pushing it out.  And, the lever action foot pedal is a little heavy for smaller adults, but man this thing has taken a beating and never failed.
The hands-freeness of this gate makes me so happy. I can walk through it with a baby in my arms and other junk in my hands, and I don't have any trouble getting it open. The foot pedal requires a lot of pressure, so my five year old has a hard time getting in and out, but that is okay because sometimes I want to keep her out of the kitchen, too! The installation was a breeze, and the gate has not moved a millimeter since I put it up despite being pulled on by both the baby and the five year-old. And what pleases me most is that I cannot find a place anywhere on the gate for fingers to be pinched at any stage of being open, closed or closing. We are using one extension with this gate. The measurements of it (the gate) and what space it will fit (with/without extensions) is accurate too.
We had no idea there were so many (confusing) options to buying a gate. This was the ONLY one that did what we needed without any extra bells and whistles. Because we were not using it around the stairs, we wanted a metal gate, that was pressure mounted, and swung open - easy, right??? Wrong!The only other one we could find in the stores is Evenflo's gate with a remote. We really didn't want to have a situation where the electronics might fail (or just need new batteries), so this gate was the winner. It took minutes to install and it couldn't be easier to use (I was weary of the foot petal at first). It clicks shut easily with just a swing of the gate. Just make sure you use the instructions to install it so you have the correct tightness for the latch (they provide a wrench that takes out the guesswork).The ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the width. Many models go wider and you have to purchase an extension for larger openings (i.e. our "I thought, standard" hallway). Because it fits smaller openings, it makes for a very narrow gate. I would prefer they made two models so you're not left with a small opening while walking through a larger hall.Otherwise - it's THE gate to have for non-stair situations!!!
We've had two of these gates for six months and have been almost 100% happy with them. The other reviewers who note that some parts are made of cheap plastic are right - one of the little click thingies on the bottom of one of our two gates get stuck more than it should, but it still works well enough for our purposes. We love how they open and close by pushing on the pedal (ours has worked perfectly, although I see that some had said that theirs breaks) and opening with the knee. We use them to block off parts of our house to our one year old and have used them since he started to crawl. We are ordering a third one to block off the stairway upstairs now. Based on our experience and reading many reviews before deciding which gate to buy, it is my sense that for the price, most people are very happy with this gate. You might be able to spend double or triple and get THE PERFECT GATE, but really this one will probably do for about everyone. There are a few that break more than they should and very rarely a toddler that can figure out how to open them. However, our child tends to be the investigative type and has thus far made no progress learning to open the gate. This seems to be a good, decent popular working gate for most people and needs. I recommend it.
Utilized these for our stairs and they work very well.  I was surprised how nice they looked once they arrived.  Being able to utilize a step to unlatch the gate is very nice to have, seeing as our kid or some other object seems to be in our hands every time we go up and down the stairs.However, we required two extensions on each of the gates we purchased in order to get to the appropriate width for our staircases so I would recommend making sure you measure your stairs before ordering this gate and the necessary extensions.
I Only rate this item 4 Stars because I just purchased it today.  It was very simple to assemble, I didnt even need my husband for help.  We purchased this gate because of the great reviews and also because I have 2 70lbs Terriers that need to start getting used to being guarded off.  Although Im only 6 months pregnant I know this gate is going to work out great for our dogs when our baby is here.  We've had it up all day and the dogs jump on it with no problem.  The gate is sturdy comfy and attractive as well which is important in my house, most of all seems very safe. I highly recommend this product for all parent who have dogs in their house no matter what size they are.I would be giving it 5 stars if I had this gate longer,  but couldnt wait to post the great review after purchasing it and seeing how great my dogs are adapting to it.
I love this gate.  It is easy to install and works great.  You have to step on the foot pedal to open the gate and little kids can't step hard enough so it is perfect.  We are moving to a new house and we are getting two more for the staircase.  Who wants to step over a gate?  This is certainly worth the extra money.
So we had a little bit of an interesting situation. My husband and I were moving in to my parents' house after they built their house. We were preparing to live in the house about 1 year in advance, which is when I purchased this gate and installed it at my parents' house for when they had my daughter over there. It was barely used for the good part of that year, left open most of the time. Right before we moved in, my daughter ran into the gate (wasn't hurt, thank goodness) but it broke apart. Not only was the outside covered in plastic, the entire hinge was made of plastic! Are you kidding me? That much for a gate and you can't even give me a durable hinge? Sorry, but this was a waste of money!
Easy to install, user friedly, props open while they're asleep, truly hands free. We bought 2!
Very good gate and easy to open with your foot stepping on it. It needs a lot of pressure to open, so it's great that kids can't open it. I recommend this gate!
This gate is so much easier to open than the other top-latch gate we have. I really like it a lot!
I bought two much cheaper gates before buying this one and really wish I would have just bought this one to begin with. It is well worth the money and doesn't fall down when pushed against and the floor handle works really well when my hands are full. Also, just a note I thought mine was bent when I first got it, but once my husband installed it according to the directions it was perfect.
After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this wasn't my favorite - but is still a good gate.  I just preferred some of the features of the others.  If it had a wider gate opening, I would have given it a 5 star rating.  I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here's my take on three different gates.I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you're looking for. The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and 2) the latch mechanismFirst Years - Hands-Free Gate-----------------------------cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32" Tall / fits 29"-34" doorway width / 1.5" bar to step over / gate opening 17"- My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17" wide! I'm 5'8" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However...- The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width.- Good height to the gate.- It was very sturdy in my doorway.- This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor.- Fits only up to 34" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension.-  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one.Kidco Center Gateway:---------------------cost $85 & extensions $24 / gate is 29.5" Tall / fits 29.25" to 37.5" doorway width / 1" bar to step over / gate opening 22"- Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22". (This certainly won points from my 6'2" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others). I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature.- This one also had the most secure latch feature. You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru. I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out.- This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become "weaker" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37" and your door opening is 36.5", it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34").-  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white.-  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1" high (seems less of a tripping risk).-  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 8/04)-  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need.-  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up.-  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller.-  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it!Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate---------------------------------------------cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36" Tall / fits 28"-48" doorway width / 2" bar to step over / gate opening 19"-  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal.-  The gate opening is about 19" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider.-  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it.-  It does come with its own extensions in 5" and 10" so it more easily fits the wider doorways.-  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33" and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75" as needed).- It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far. I also just like the way the taller gate looks.- It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2".- If if fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money.All three gates seemed to:- Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly.- Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall.- Were pretty easy to set up.- All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look "cheaper" to me than the others.Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.  Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value. Good luck with your own purchase!
We still had to use hands to open be/c hitting it with your knee hurts. Also the plastic foot peddle started to warp after a few months of use.
Not only is this gate incredibly easy to install and incredibly sturdy, but it is also great for pets.  We don't have any children, but we do have two dogs and two cats.  The dogs are constantly trying to get at the cats' food and litter box.This gate is actually a replacement for another gate we had to keep the dogs out, but it was flimsy and hard to maneuver around.  I just installed this gate in about 10 minutes and it's great because the cats can still have the run of the house by jumping it.  It also keeps our Black Lab from passing through.Buy this gate!  It's a wonderful, well thought-out product.
I love the idea of this gate but was not able to use it due to the hard wood flooring - decorative baseboards.  Thought it would clear it , but it did not.  So check out you base boards before you order.
We have two of these gates that we use to contain the babies (15 mo. and 4 mo.) IN the living room and to keep the dog OUT of the living room.  Easily installed and adjustable.  We haven't had to use any extensions.  15 mo. old can't open it but 6 yr. old nephew can operate it easily on his own.  We are buying a third one of these to keep the 15 mo. old out of the laundry room.  They are WONDERFUL!
I have researched every gate on the market at this point.  So far we are extremely happy with this gate.  We wanted pressure mounted gates but I was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband.  I thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis.  So far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than I anticipated.
We are veterans of many types of gates for both dogs and now kids, and I am crestfallen that it took us this long to discover this terrific model. It combines the security of a permanent mount with the relative ease of installation and occasional portability of pressure-mounted models.I had two irregular doorways to fill in with child gates so our scootching 13-month old could play safely in the area. For one large opening I used the SuperYard Gate, which is a decent all-plastic telescoping gate with permanent-mounting rails, and for the other I used the First Years hands-free with a single extension. After seeing how secure the First Years was, and how incredibly east it was to install the extensions, even though I'm happy with the SuperYard Gate, I wish I had bought two First Years Hands-Free,The operation is really cool -- you step on a pedal, and knee the thing open. It works in both directions! I was skeptical the pedal was baby-proof, but letting my son (who is the median weight of a two and a half year old) put his full weight on it didn't budge it a bit.  The design is also very attractive; nice thin white metal instead of the usual lattice-work plastic on most gates.One comment on an earlier negative review, where the Grandparent indicated their 15-month-old could pull up the foot pedal: this cannot open the gate if the top is properly tightened! (See below). I tried this, and the pedal will slide but not allow the gate to open if the top is tight.I have only a few minor caveats to convey:- when installing it, make sure you follow the instructions and use the little plastic wrench (included) to do some fine-tuning tightening, so that the upper latch is the required distance from the catch (a wrench-width). This is easy to do, and I found that when I tightened it up as the instructions indicated, the good fit of the latch became excellent even with a slightly-irregular-from-vertical door post.- the opening might be a little narrow compared to some other gates; it took a bump or two on my calf to get the hang of, nothing terribly difficult or painful.- the extension might not be necessary if you have an opening that's right on the cusp of the suggested 29-34" door opening; if you  have an opening right around the maximum, I'd recommend installing it without the extension first to avoid having to make a return for a possible un-needed extension. Installing and de-installing the extension, as I noted, is a piece of cake.- this is not "portable" the way a simpler gate is, but can be de-installed and re-installed in less than two minutes. Since it swings open, if you want to use the gate in only one location, the portability isn't an issue.All in all, just about the coolest gate I've used.
I RECEIVED THIS FOR MY BABY SHOWER AND AM VERY PLEASED! IT IS EASY TO OPEN WHILE CARRYING MY BABY AND KEEPS THE DOG IN THE FAMILY ROOM WHEN WE ARE AWAY. THE DOOR SWINGS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS WHICH IS TERRIFIC IN MY DOORWAY. I PLAN TO BUY MORE FOR THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
I love how easy this gate is when walking through with my arms full of sleeping baby! It takes a heavy step to open but it's truly baby Proof!
I really love this gate. easy to use, and easy to install. This is also very sturdy. my wild son can't tear it down, I loved it so much I bought one for my mom's house too.enjoy
We use this gate with one extension and it works perfect for keeping my very large 1 yr old (~30 lbs) out of the kitchen while cooking.  Very sturdy and nearly impossible for him to open on his own. The pedal is a great design feature and allows us to move easily in and out while carrying things (garbage?).  No complaints after 3 months of use.
I really really like this gate. My 19 year old grandson put it up for me as a means of keeping our dog limited to a certain area of our house, and to keep the grandkids in a more controlled area as well. It was easy to install and so far seems to be holding up very well. My only concern is whether it will last over time because we get so much traffic in our house and you do have to use a good bit of &#34;push&#34; to release and open the gate each time.  But overall, at this point, we love it!
There are so many pros, so few cons to this gate.  It's tall, there's no way my 2-year-old can get over it.  Incredibly convenient swinging door.  If you follow the instructions on how to correctly tighten it on the door frame you won't have trouble.  I didn't do that the first time and I was getting frustrated.  The gate was smarter than me!My son, who is Mr. Motor Skills, cannot open it.Would make an excellent dog gate for small dogs.Sometimes the pedal can get sticky and you have to push on it a little harder, but that's really my only complaint.
The gate is decent construction, and the lever has enough weight where only an adult can open it.  The mounts aren't sturdy.This gate only fits in our doorways, and this is with the extensions maxed-out to their maximum length.  This doesn't make for a secure fit in our doorways, and it is unusable anywhere else.  It's too small.  It fits soundly in doors less than 30&#34; in width, so measure your doorway before you buy.The mounts do not securely fasten onto the gate, so when you move it from doorway to doorway or when installing, these fall out of the gate, and you have to balance these during installation.Yes, there are extensions available, but these are sold as an accessory, and with the combined cost, there are other better options available.I don't recommend this product as we replaced it with a simpler, lower-cost solution. Save yourself.
My wife and I had gone through about 8 types of baby gates, including 5 or 6 for the entryway that connects living room and kitchen.  Part of the problem is that the entryway is extra wide--over 50 inches--and we had trouble finding gates wide enough just to fit.  After several frustrating attempts at finding a decent gate (including resultant trips back to the baby store for refunds/exchanges), we finally bought this foot-pedal operated gate (with 2 extensions) and it works awesome.  It's absolutely the nicest gate we have ever bought.  Although our son (18 months, ~28 pounds) has an idea of -how- it works, the foot pedal requires far too much pressure for him to get it to open.  This gate should be usable until he's at least 35, if not 40 pounds.  In addition, since it's made of metal bars and not some sort of crisscross pattern, my child cannot stick his toes in it and try to climb over--all he can do is step up on the bottom metal bar, which is only about 3 inches off the ground.As an added bonus, the gate is tall enough to keep kids out but not so tall that my cat can't jump over it easily.Only caveats I can think of:+ You have to tighten the tension screws periodically.+ The gate opening is a few inches narrower than would be ideal, so if you're "wide" like me you have to get used to kind of side-stepping through it.+ By default, the gate makes an audible "click" when it closes, which can wake a light-sleeping child; but with a little practice, you can get it to close soundlessly.+ The wrench provided for tightening is plastic, and once the tension screws get tight the wrench tends to slip off them a little too easily.All in all I would definitely recommend this gate to anyone.  I only wish they made a hardware-mounted version for the tops of stairways.
This is hands down a fabulous baby gate. The foot pedal is even hard for an adult to open if you don't put your entire bodyweight down on it--making it impossible for little ones to open. We have a toddler who has outsmarted several other gates, and this one is incredible sturdy and well-made, we will be buying more of this style if we are blessed with another child! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
works great! my child can not open it. i have 2 of these installed. buy the extension if you have wider opening. if you have even wider opening - place a piece of wood next to the wall, i added an extra piece of 2x4 for one of the wide opening in the house. it gives the extra 2 inches needed and also protects the wall.hands free operation is very handy when you have to hold the child or carry other stuff.
This gate went on sale very cheap so I bought and instead of sending it to me they sent me neosporin and returned my money. They did not even email me to let me know. I am very disapointed and I think its odd that they sent a tube of neosporin. Maybe it was for the hurt that not receiving my gate caused:)
I needed a gate that would keep my active baby out of the bathroom from the bedroom.  We had an opening with no door.  So I went by the reviews on amazon and chose this gate and I must say the reviews are very accurate.Pluses:- It took no time at all to install and it was pretty self explanatory (about 5-10 minutes)- It is completely safe (no accidents here)- It actually looks very nice so there's no dilemma between child proofing and baby safety- It's hands free when you don't have an extra hand- It stays very well- It's sturdy and baby can't get in/out- The foot pedal is super tight so there's no way your baby can learn how to open/close- There's no cause for concern of little fingers getting caught- Children may find it actually fun to open/closeAfter one month of use I'm happy to report that there are NO CONS!  If you need a gate, look no further!*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/UPDATE:Bought two more!  Can't think of a better looking gate to put all around the house!
This gate is a great asset, especially if you have pets.  We were able to block our two dogs from the baby in the kitchen and when he's in his playgym on the floor.  I love the fact that you don't have to unlock it and put it aside.  It also swings in both directions.  It was a little pricy, but definitely worth it.
I've been a child care provider and teacher for years. You come to absolutely dread going in and out of inferior baby  gates. This gate is the best. It's truly hands free and child proof. Love it.
It looks cute but  the wire is too short, the clip is big and hard which hurts my baby if he touches it.
It is ok, but only works with certain kids of pacifiers. It does not work on gum drop brands.The clip doesn't stay closed on most clothing.
The product was cheap and easy to attach to my sons' onesies.  I liked that this was not a metal pacifier attacher.
Since my granddaughter loves Winnie the Pooh , this was just perfect.She plays with the Pooh clip and the strap hold the pacifier .
I absolutely love this gate.  We were going to get two, but only got one to make sure we'd like it.  We didn't want to drill any holes and our gate sits at the bottom of the stairs just like in the pictures, only on the floor not the first step.  It's great.  All four points where the gate touches the wall are different depth and I also used the extension kit and it works perfectly.  It is very stable and my little boy can't open it or pull it down. I'm about to order another one for the top of the stairs.
Easy to use, easy to install and it has so many different options of installation (extensions, y-spindles, stairway adaptors) and all were easy to figure out. Even my 60 plus mother said it was easy to figure out how to use it without any instruction. Really liked how the bottom "supports" that press against the wall were flat on the bottom edge so they lay against the floor better. My other brand of gate didnt have that. Only complaint was my box had no directions in it. But managed without them.
we wanted a gate for the balcony door and this fit perfectly! i wasn't sure abt tension gates but this is great, no drilling and it's very sturdy. the gate is so simple in design and it's perfect for our place. set up was fast and easy
So this gate's latch is slightly annoying but it did the job and kept my child off the stairs. Like this product and would purchase again.
We bought this gate a few months ago.  It's generally well made and is sturdier than some other gates.  Overall, it's a good choice, although in my opinion it is a bit overpriced.  An appropriate price for the quality would be around $50.PROS:-Adjustable size-Door swings both in both directions-Door is pretty easy to open-Pressure-mounted (no damage to walls)CONS:-You have to lift the door as you open it.  This gets to be a bit of a pain-Not as sturdy as a hardware-mounted gate... it loosens over time so you do need to take minute to tighten it up periodically.Other reviewers have commented that the bar across the bottom is annoying.  I actually find it to be fine.  You do have to step over it, but it's only about 1" so it doesn't bother me.I will update this review when my baby starts walking... I'm hoping that the pressure mount will be strong enough to hold up to a toddler!
I would highly recommend this gate!  We are using it at the bottom our basement stairs, and it is just what we needed.  Installation was not difficult at all.  I would recommend reading through the entire instruction booklet and looking at the pictures in the back first, but the entire installation only took me about 15 minutes, and that was with my 3 year old helping me.Things I love:1.  Nice wide gate (the part that swings open is wider than any other gate I have seen.  This is very helpful when trying to get through with a baby on one hip and a laundry basket on the other)2.  Secure latch (I have a 3 year old and an 11 month old, and my 3 year old can open a different gate we have, and sometimes forgets to shut it.  This gate requires more strength to open it, which means I am confident leaving the kids to play while I am in the next room)3.  Ease of installation (seriously, this was a very easy install requiring no additional tools)Things I would improve:1.  The height of the gate.  My 3 year old is an escape artist, and he has already figured out that he can push several toys over to the gate and climb over it.  Not too big of a deal since he can safely climb up and down the stairs, but it doesn't keep him contained at all.2.  The instruction booklet that comes with the gate.  the booklet has instructions in several different languages in the front, and then referneces pictures that are in the back of the book.  This means that you must constantly flip pages when reading the instructions.  I understand why they did it (1 set of pictures for several different languages), but it would be nice to have the corresponding pictures located on the same page as the instructions.All in all I would definately recommend this gate to anyone!
Very pleased with this gate. It was easy to install even with the extension we needed to buy with it. My 4 year old can also use it without any issues which I like.
I cannot believe I waited until my 3rd baby to buy one of these!!  I'd always seen other Mum's and Dad's using them when we were out and about but always thought they'd be really uncomfortable.Well, I finally bought one and tried it with the birth of my 3rd child, (Mainly because I couldn't convince my eldest daugther, 3, to give up her seat in our double pram!) AND I LOVE IT!For me, it is extremely comfortable to use.  I've used it for short and long periods (all day) of time and haven't had any problems.What I love about the Baby Bjorn carrier is that it's so easy to use alone.  It's easy to strap on, pick up your baby, strap him or her in and off you go. It's also really easy to get the baby out again.  The buckles and fasteners are easy to use and adjust as needed.My son loves it - he sleeps in it, or looks around as we walk along.  We've used it on walks, outings or just around the house.  I also use it when I go with my girls to playgroup.  I have two hands free to help them on play equipment and my son gets to see what his big sisters are doing.I would suggest trying before you buy if you do have any back problems as it may not suit you, but is has been a huge success in this house.
I love watching my partner carry our baby in the Baby Bjorn,or "Bjorning the baby" as we call it, because poor Daddy is a real baby fumbler. The Baby Bjorn is simple to use, distributes the weight of baby evenly over both shoulders, and lulls the little one to sleep very easily.  I've seen Dad gain confidence taking charge of the little guy and strut proudly with the little one attatched to his belly. While Baby gets the benefit of being close to Daddy and getting a feel for Daddy's rhythm and hearing Daddy's voice up close, Mommy gets the benefit of a break once in a while! We used it at the State Fair this year and I can't begin to list its benefits over a sroller!  If you're debating between getting this or buying a sling, buy the Bjorn, and custom make your own sling (or find someone who does).  This is the best.
After hearing all the positive comments about the Baby Bjorn carrier, I registered for it and got one as a shower gift. For the first few weeks we couldn't use it because my baby's head flopped around too much, even when the carrier was tightened to its maximum head tightness (and our son is a big baby). So we purchased the NoJo sling, which my husband found pretty comfortable but I never really liked because I felt the weight was not evenly distributed.I am in good shape, work out and lift weights, but on long walks the Bjorn carrier really hurts my shoulders. The straps cut in when I wear it for power walks, which was the purpose of my getting the carrier. I'm fine for about 20 minutes to a half hour, but after that I'm constantly tugging at the straps and trying to evenly distribute the weight.For this reason, I'm looking into getting the Bjorn Active which appears to have better padding. My suggestion would be that if you really want to be active with your carrier, be careful to get something with good, comfortable shoulder padding. Your shoulders are carrying the weight of your child in this carrier.
My husband and I are students with two young children - ages 2 (27 months) and 3 months, so first of all, purchasing this item was a big step when we live on a tiny budget!  We LOVE it!!!  We bought the brand new one (not the one pictured above- it's the new 2003 model) It has the attatchements that slide in on the sides, making it a sinch to put on.  It also has the plastic snaps to hold up baby's head and the teathers to tighten or loosen the part that holds baby's head.  Anyhow, it is wonderful!  the new 2003 model is so easy to put on, and even my 6'4&quot; 260lb hubby LOVES it, and thinks it is really comfy.  It also makes my life easy with my two little ones - my toddler is in the stoller, and the baby is in the baby bjorn - and i don't get tired of it no matter how long or far we end up walking.  WORTH THE MONEY, in my opinion!!!
Baby Bjorn was a gift. I never thought I would use it.  I used to go to the grocery store with my daughter in her car seat (she is 3 months).  She would do nothing but cry!!  I tried to carry her. That did not work and I did not feel she was safe with me pushing the cart and carrying her. I finally thought to use the Baby Bjorn Carrier.  What a surprise. She loves it!!!  I got to shop for all the things I needed at the grocery store!!  She faces forward in it and loves to look around.  She also falls asleep in it!  It truly is a life saver!!! I thought I was never going to be able to leave the house without my daughter crying her head off!! Must Have!!!!!!!!!
I've only been using this for a month and this product has made my life significantly easier!  At home with a new baby, I really love using this around the house.  When my son wanted to be held, I would just put him in the carrier, thus leaving my hands free to do chores.  I had a sling which he didn't like, and plus the carrier is much more secure than the sling.  It is also great for walks outside when using a stroller would be too much of a hassle.  He loves the feeling of being next to my body and almost always falls asleep when he's in it!
This is a great carrier!  My son loves to fall asleep in it while I am working.  He was fortunately big enough to be carried around it in from day 1, but your child must be 21 inches to start using it.
I'm 5' 11&#34; so I've never had a need for a kitchen stool. But out of curiosity I stood on this to see if it really could hold an adult (170lber) and it sure can! Actually, now that I have it for my son, as a potty training - hand washing stool, I'm actually wishing I'd had it years ago for a kitchen stool. It is much easier than tip toeing and reaching.Tho it is sturdy, it is also lightweight enough that my 2 year old son can move it into position in front of the toilet or the sink. We also use it as a door stop to keep the bathroom door open.Very multi functional.
This step stool has wonderful grip on the floor! I love that the entire stepping surface has treads for little feet, too!
It is a stool, yes, but I think it has been used more as a side table to her little chair in the family room until recently. This is a well made step stool. Looks good. Good rubber on bottom and top. Light enough for her to carry around, which she does to reach things. Now that she has become interested in the potty though, she has taken it into the bathroom and left it in front of the potty permanently. Which I am glad. My only problem with it so far is she is small statured and potty training early which means she has a little difficulty getting on and off the potty, even with the stool. The stool is just a little short for her and I wish it was bigger across because several times she has tried to step down onto it and she catches only the front edge and it tips forward. Glad I have been right there to catch her. So, quality gets 5 stars, size only gets 3 stars as it really needs to be wider and longer to be a sturdy step base.
this barely brings my kid up to the sink height upstairs. It isn't tall enough to reach the sink downstairs, which has slick tiles that could use the BabyBjorn skid-proof grip. oh well.
Works perfectly, it has rubber on the bottom so that it doesn't slide on hardwood or tile. My son loves to carry it around since we bought it, since now he can reach everything and be a troublemaker haha. I bought it for him to reach the toilet, but it makes it's rounds all around the house all day so I'm getting more than my money's worth.
Sturdy, easy for my 2-yr old to move around, and it doesn't slip when she's on it. Good large surface area. Good color selections. Grippy top and feet. I just wish it was slightly taller (like 2&#34;) but otherwise it's perfect.
This stool is the perfect height, good quality,and reasonably priced. My daughter uses it for the toilet and the sink and we haven't had any issues. Good buy.
This product is not the safest step stool for kids especially little kids. My twins are 2 years old and we recently start using the step stool and the matching potty and to be honest both products are disappointing. This worked perfect in our guest bathroom where standing on top of a rag is well support. But my other bathroom is tile and it slides a lot regardless of the rubber underneath. Also the stool is quite small and both of my kids have fallen from it few times because they will step on the corner first and before they get the chance to put the other foot up they are on the floor. Before I even decided this will be a definite return my kids did not care to use it almost as if they were scared to go on it.
Nice nonslip surface and feet make it safer for the little ones to reach the bathroom sink. It is a little short, but I'm not sure higher would be as safe anyway. Gets lots of use from my 2 & 4yos.
Nice, sturdy, attractive step. 20-month old can stand on it without it being &#34;tippy&#34;. I'm 105#, and it supports me just fine too.
We already had a plastic step stool from Target and a heavy 2-step wooden one but were not satisfied with either of them.  I remembered seeing the Babybjorn step stool at a friend's house and decided to take it for a spin.  I'm glad I did.PROS:- Very sturdy- Entire step surface is covered in non-slip rubber- The base also has non-slip rubber- The underside does not have any sharp or jagged plasticCONS:- Premium priceOur plastic step stool we got from Target worked, but was not ideal.  The stepping surface was only partially covered in non-slip materials and the underside had lots of jagged plastic.  Whenever I put my fingers around the bottom to move it, I'd poke myself with it and silently (sometimes not so silently) curse the thing.  The Target one and the Babybjorn are the same height (6 inches) so if your child needs something bigger, obviously this won't work for you.  My oldest child needs to get on their tippy toes to reach the sink and it works well for our younger child while going potty.  The larger wooden 2-step stool worked great for reaching the sink, but it was just bulky and moving it so adults could use the sink was inconvenient.Both my kids have used the Babybjorn Safe Step Stool for about 3 weeks and have never come close to tipping it over or falling.  The base is very wide compared to the other plastic step stool we have.  In my opinion, accidents happen.  Sometimes, it has nothing to do with anything.  I'm very confident in the stability of the step stool and if my kids fall off of it because they were careless or put all their weight on the very edge of a corner, well, then they'll learn to balance better next time.Even with the premium price, I highly recommend it and I would purchase it again.
Got this for grandkids for the bathroom, but we end up using it in the kitchen so the kids can help. I like it because it won't slide out from underneath them. I would tell anyone this is the nicest one I have every used. I even use it.
We use this cute little step stool all over the house. We use it in the restroom so that my toddler can brush her teeth and wash her hands. I also use it in the kitchen so that I can reach things on the higher shelves without having to climb on the counters or bring a chair in from the dining room. We really like that it has the non skid rubbery traction on the top and the legs so it's a little more stable. I would recommend the product to anyone looking for a great little stool.  :)
This step stool is just right!  It is light but strong and sturdy.  Good grip surface on top and bottom.  Made in USA too!!  We bought one for each bathroom.
I bought this for my 20 month old son bathroom. This stool is very sturdy and because of the rubberized bottom does not move on the floor which is a big plus. It is a great height and helps him be able to reach the sink. He wants to wash his hands all the time since he is able to reach! He can also get on and off this stool his self being that it is sturdy enough for that. I have never had a problem with it moving or tipping over. Great buy!
My toddler loves this stepstool.  She uses it all the time to brush her teeth, wash her hands, and use the potty.  It's very sturdy and even I've stood on it!  Recommended.
This stool doesn't slip on our tile floor and is the perfect height! Bright colors add a bit of fun.
Bought this for my little ones to stand on in the bathroom to wash their hands and for when they started potty training on the big potty.  Has held up for a number of years and still looks brand new.  Purchased a second one for their bathroom upstairs.  No tipping and not bulky.  Perfect for little feet.
Love the color and design. Slip resistant and easy for my 2 year old to carry, but I needed it to be just an inch or so taller for him to reach the light switch and sink. Will put away until he's a little taller.
I got this step stool in green to match my son's potty in his bathroom.  It's great and worked well for potty training.  He goes on the matching potty and then steps on the stool to wash his hands!  He loves having his very own and noticed that they match.
There is rubber on the bottom for no slip and rubber on the top for no slip as well! Height could be a bit taller but most are about the same height.
we really like this step stool. its sturdy and well made. my only issue is that its not wide/long enough. other than that, its GREAT!!!
I bought this with my Bjorn potty chair.  It's nice and sturdy.  Very pleased with the product.
I am potty training my 21 month old, and he can get on and off the big potty (with Baby Bjorn seat attached) very easily...he absolutely would not be comfortable on the big potty without this stool under his feet. However, even though my boy is tall for his age, this stool is NOT high enough for him to reach the faucet for washing his hands at this point, he will need to grow a few more inches for that. But, I still give 5 stars because I don't fault the stool, it is sturdy and well made and looks nice. Plus, if you look at the ideal stool height for the potty and most sinks, clearly it isn't going to be the same. I figure within the next year it will become the perfect sink stool, but until then I will have to use a higher kitchen stool for that. Still glad I bought this, but be aware it may not work for both purposes if you are potty training a young toddler.
This step is stylish and well made. I love the look of it. It can be a little tricky to clean the rubberized top, but I like the construction of it and the grip on the top.
I used this for my sons potty training. Great product for the price paid. it can be used for multi purpose inside the house as well.
We have enjoyed this for our almost 2 year old over the past few months- helps him &#34;help&#34; with dishes, brush his teeth, and wash his hands. I like the gray color and is very grippy/stable. He moves it around the house as needed!
I thought this would be a bit higher - I'm 5'5 but seem to be struggling to give my baby bath. wouldn't recommend
LOVE LOVE LOVE! I purchased several of these for my kids. They are great in the bathrooms and kitchen. They don't slip and I liked the color choices...I like clean white! Excellent choice for step stool for children!
Simple and useful. My 2 yr. old uses it to get to the bathroom sink. When I bought it this was the most unpopular color, but it matched my son's jungle theme bathroom, I love it! The bottom and top surfaces are slip proof, which was a must!
I actually bought this before my son was old enough to use it and ironically I use it now!  This is lighweight, has a rubber bottom to prevent slipping and I love the color.  It is perfect to reach things that are just barely out of reach - like the top of cabinets with out me having to get out our heavy little step ladder.  I'm sure that my son will love it to when he is a little older to reach the sink and things.
There are many steps, and I read around what makes a good step for kids.  My criteria is that one that minimizes a chance of slipping.  My 2-year old likes washing hands on his own, but that means he will splash a lot of water.  For the past months, this is doing a great job providing a safe place to stand on.  This gives just enough height for my son to wash his hands on his own.  He does not use this for climbing onto a toilet, so I cannot tell whether this will work for him.  My son is very tall 2-year old (38.5 inch tall), and this gives just enough boost for allowing him to wash his hands on his own.  If you baby is short, reaching to a faucet may be challenging.
I bought this for my 3 year old to use in front of our elongated toilet.  It gets her to the perfect height and is very sturdy.  I am using it on a tile floor with large tiles (12x12) and haven't had any issues with it moving around.
This is a perfect little step stool! It is light enough for my toddler to carry around and short enough that I don't worry about her falling off of it.  She uses it all over the house, just carrying it from room to room to reach things or to play pretend.  The color is exactly as pictured and I love the grippy top so she doesn't slip.
This is my 2nd babybjorn step stool.  I liked that this was gray (matches my daughter's grey/pink room).  I bought this for her as a step stool to climb in and out of her big girl bed.  I probably should have 1st tried it out with our other babybjorn step stool - but I didn't b/c it is being used for the bathroom - but this stool is just a little too low.  My daughter doesn't feel too comfortable climbing down from bed (which actually might be a good thing, lol)...if it was a little higher it would have been perfect.  I do like that these stools feel more stable than many of the other kids stools, yet it is very lightweight.
This step stool is great, especially if you have a small bathroom.  Also doubles as a seat  while you're bathing your kid!
This step stool is very nice and sturdy. It can bear more than 170lbs. It also has a slip resistant bottom so it stays in place. I would definitely recommend this for children and adults too..
Its sturdy and a good step. The step is exactly as described. Green, plastic, and lightweight. Would buy this again
Great little light weight non slip stool. Good colors. Washes easy. Is a tad shorter then my other stools but still a very funcional piece. Very very sturdy! Highly recommend
My 2 year old loves this step. It helps him reach the sink to wash his hands and brush his teeth. He even leans dwn and says hi to the bear on it.The step is sturdy so he won't slip off of it.
My daughter loves this stool! She plays with it and also uses it to get up to the potty. The package says that it stays put no matter where the child steps on it - and it's true. It's very stable and does not tip even if she steps near the edge. It's the perfect height for her to sit on (she is a tall 19-month old). Haven't had it very long, but it seems very durable. Highly recommend.
very sturdy grip to the floor.  right height for my two year old to reach the faucet (with the extender).  want to get a second one for the toilet so she can get up herself
I keep this step in my sons bathroom along with the Bjorn toilet seat. The simple design makes it so easy to clean and use. Ive learned my lesson with the cheaper step stools made of thin plastic or cheap wood and wont purchase them again. I love how sturdy the design is. I also use this stool to sit on next to the tub while bathing my son, saves my back!
Not that we are using it non-stop, but my son likes to use it here and there. Of course I'm by his side, but so far, step seems stable for our use.
I love this stool - extremely strong, yet lightweight.  Non-skid grip is on every surface that touches the floor - very sturdy.  Same material on top, which is not slippery, but never sticky.  Cleans easily with some spray cleaner and a paper towel, or toss it in the shower, and voila!  Best of all, it is not one of those surfaces that attract lint and gunk - that drives me nuts.  This stays very clean-looking.However, the thing I like the very best is the width to depth ratio - this is a nice, "fat" rectangle.  Other stools we have, such as IKEA's F&Ouml;RSIKTIG [ ... ], and Dr. Merry's Potty Pal [ ... ], are much narrower front-to-back (from, say, the perspective of the stool being in front of a sink).  This is important, because toddlers move around, and rarely have a visual memory of where they have placed their feet:  the depth of this allows for some foot movement without danger of falling off (much less precision required).  The other added benefit of this is that an adult bum can sit on this very comfortably(!), as I do every time I'm in the bathroom assisting my daughter, who no longer needs the stool to get up on the potty.  MUCH better than squatting or standing.  I weigh 186 lbs, and can stand or sit on this without any creaking, buckling, or unstable movement.Finally, as an aesthetic concern:  I love that it comes in black and white, which looks very neutral in our B & W bath.  Will probably keep this beyond the toddler years as it doesn't look very babyish and is so well made.
Solid, nice quality. Baby is too small to use it when potty but she figured out to use the stool to reach things!
I like Avent bottles but I dont trust these nipples. I dont think the water completely dries out of them so there is some residue that leaves it susceptible to mildew.
In fact, the entire Avent feeding system, is perfect!  I own every sippy cup on the market, and these are the best.
I've purchased many sippy cups in the past 6 months. These have been the best so far. All sippy cups leak a little, especially with a child that throws it around like a toy. However, these seem to hold up the best of any brand I've had. Pick up the travel sealing disc accessories and you have a leak proof system for diaper bags.Philips Avent Sealing Discs, BPA-FreeI'm not sure if Avent sells separately the little clear discs that go inside the sippy lid, but that would be great if they did. I seem to loose mine.
for the most part we are using straw sippy cups but these are great for the last bottle of the night
I bought these for my son for his infant carrier. He loves them! Whenever we are out and he gets upset, I pull or swing the bugs and he stops. Unfortunately he'll be in a regular seat soon and I don't think I'll be able to use them anymore. Also I wish the 'vibrating' bug went up slower. Other than that great toy!!! Also a great price!!!
A friend gave these to me when my daughter was an infant for her car carrier and she loved them.  These were the first toys that she swatted and played with.  They kept her entertained on the long car trip to visit family back in N.Y.  There was hardly a peep out of her.  Now that she is out of the carrier I put them on the bar that goes with her walker now she pulls them to her mouth and chews on them. You can also put them on the stroller or a highchair to keep baby entertained.
My 6 month old has loved the lady bug since the beginning.  However, the other two take more effort to get her attention.  Now that she has teethed on them for a couple of months, the crackly feel and sound in the wings is going away.
My 4 month old loves these bugs!  She's just started to grab the wings of them and pull them to her mouth, and is always surprised when they bounce back and rattle when she lets go.  She hasn't gotten the hang of the buzzing one yet, though.  This was one of our better purchases for such a small amount of money.
These bugs are a lot of fun anywhere.  Right now I have them on my son's carseat handle and he just loves to stare at them.  One of the bugs has a mechanism that when you pull on down on it, it springs back up and makes a bzzzing noise.  He loves it.
My son loves these toys.  The second I put him in his carseat, he starts grabbing them.  I didn't think much of them until just recently when he started grabbing for them, before that, he didn't really notice them.  I love the different colors patterns, etc.  My bugs are slightly different than the picture on here, but these look just as good.  I would recommend these to everyone.
These are great toys to entertain your new baby.  Just hang them from the bar on their infant car seat and they will be entertained while you do small errands around the house or at the market.  My kids loved to bat at these bugs and each bug makes a different noise too!
My daughter loves her bugs and has ever since she was born!  We put them all over--her crib, carseat, swing, bouncy seats, etc.  She really concentrates on them and it's great to have something so small and easily moved that she loves.
We put these bugs on our infant seat a few weeks after our daughter was born.  She is now 3 months old and just loves these bugs!  It keeps her so occupied in the stroller.  She can't really see the bugs when she is in the car being that the handle is pushed back.  When these bugs are in her sight she just stares at them.  The one bug that you pull down and then it goes bzzzzzzzzzzz and back up we have had some problems with, but I would buy these again.  I have told my friends about Bugs on Board.  They need to get them and I have seen these bugs everywhere!
We hung these bugs on my daughter's car seat and swing when she was just two months old. She loves the bright colors and they've kept her entertained for three months now. Cheap but well loved toy in our home!
I bought this to use with the Medela Symphony pump I'm renting. It works great. I get just as much power out of it as I do with the regular power cord at home. When you first plug it in, no words come up on the screen, but as soon as you turn on the power button on the pump, it starts working like normal. Very happy!
Older Medela pumps need the 12 V lighter, which is frequently not sold at Babies R Us.  Do not be confused and get the wrong size of volts.  I think the cut off is 2007.  You might want to double check that though.
So far I've only used mine in the car twice but the adapter works fine and it's really nice to be able to use it while traveling.
Perfect accessory for pumping on the go! It has a very long cord so you can use it anywhere in the car.
It was so wonderful to have this adapter so that I could pump in the car while my husband was driving.  It saved a lot of time on long car trips by not having to stop every couple of hours and waiting for me to pump.  I just used the pump with a cover-up and kept going.  It says that the pump may be more intense with the use of the adapter, but I never noticed a difference.
works great with my pump n style and allows me to pump on the go when necessary.  Be sure to check the voltage on our your pump before purchasing, some are 9-volt, not 12-volt.
If you're a busy mom and don't have a lot of time OR you spend a lot of time in the car this is a must have. Our family does a lot of traveling and this charger has been amazing.
Not much to say - convenient and works well! Pleased with my purchase as it makes life much easier for pumping on the go!
I bought this yesterday when I knew I was going to a "tailgate" party where I would be away from the baby and having a few drinks, and I may have to "pump and dump".  I was nervous at first, but this thing worked PERFECTLY! It worked just like it was plugged into an electrical outlet. It successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug. I also bought the Medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by. This outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet, clean and safe place to pump your milk. The cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car. I love this thing and wish I bought it sooner!! It will also be great on long trips, too, so you don't get any clogged milk ducts. Highly reccommended!!
I rented a hospital pump, the Medela Symphony, with the hope of pumping at work and on the road. I purchased this lighter adapter to go with the pump, and so far it works really well. I haven't noticed a decrease in power, and being able to pump in the car has really kept me pumping longer than I had originally planned.
For my job I am on the road and have to pump in the car a lot. The battery pack that comes with the pumps take 8 AA batteries, which only lasted me about 10x pumping for 10 mins each!! And they were energizer brand!! I like this cord because it is long enough for me to plug in and still sit in the back seat of my Venza. It is not cheaply made either like some cords!! WELL worth the money!! I wish it came with a case, even if it was a cloth bag to store it in the car. I lost the twist tie under my seat the first time I used it!!
Generally speaking this is a great product, and it's incredibly convenient to be able to pump on the go now. My only complaint is that the plug does not fit snuggly into the pump, so if there's any tension at all in the cord and/or you move it just wrong, it will come unplugged. So I just wish it was a bit more secure, but otherwise no complaints.
I was really not looking forward to wearing the hard plastic shells I'd gotten from La Leche League to help correct my inverted nipples during my last pregnancy. Knowing I was in for a world of trouble if I didn't wear them, I dug them out and just couldn't bring myself to put them on. Then I discovered these soft shells at Babies R Us, and decided to give them a try. They have a soft backing against the breast/nipple instead of rigid plastic, so comfort is key here. Instead of being small and highly domed, these are more shallow and larger, so that they are more discreet when you wear them. There are washable inserts to absorb milk, rather than having to deal with dried pooled milk. And best of all, they do indeed draw the nipple out to prepare for nursing. I'm wearing them now, and I can't even see them through my t-shirt or feel that they are there (I actually lifted the shirt up to make sure they were properly positioned, and they were!). If you have inverted or flat nipples, these are clearly the shells to get!
I got these to wean my daughter off the nipple shield. I wore these all the time the first day and by day two she was latching correctly and off the shield. I say these are the best thing for a mom trying to breast feed with inverted nipples and I have tryed everything this is the only thing that helped!
These really do work.  I recommend using them before you have the baby though.  I waited, and it was quite an ordeal.  You will save yourself considerable misery if you wear them in advance (but not too far in advance, or you can induce premature labor--talk to your obgyn).
These shells saved me from severe pain when my baby was a newborn.  They gave me some time to heal and relax.  We have a great nursing relationship because I was able to power through the pain in the very beginning.
Although they seem helpful for certain situations, I wasn't too impressed. I'm still glad that I have them in case someday they prove helpful.
These can definitely be a life saver during the first 1-2 weeks when you don't want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry.  I have small breasts so I could wear them in any bra, and I didn't have a huge leakage problem, so I changed the foam twice a day.The only problem I had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it.  I think it got damp and wasn't allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after I stopped using them.  Bottom line: the relief was worth any minor inconvenience.
These shells gave me instant relief from sore nipples associated with breastfeeding. However, know that breast shells can increase milk production (ask your lactation consultant or doctor, or just Google it). This may be fine or even welcomed for some mothers, but for me, it was an undesired side effect. Still, because they worked so well, I'd definitely use them again!
These really helped me the first few months of nursing. I nursed three children before I found these and my nipples were so sore that I couldn't even stand the feel of the soft nursing pads against them. These gave me some relief and also the very gentle pressure makes your nipple easier for the baby to latch onto. It sort of shapes them forward, if that makes sense. I also like that I could throw them in the dishwasher on the top rack.
I have both types, TheraShells and SoftShells. I have to say, there are significant differences. SoftShells have soft backing, the shell is a bit bigger and on the breasts under bra they look more natural than TheraShells. TheraShells look like you stuffed a mushroom under your bra. It looks really funny. Not so with SoftShells. The feeling compared to TheraShells is also different. While one feels wearing TheraShells, when wearing SoftShells, you can forget about them. The only thing what is bad on them are those holes what start already in about a half of the shelf. If your milk leaks a bit more, you'll have to check it frequently. Next thing - don't bend over. Seriously. Ever.
The first few weeks of breastfeeding were excruciatingly painful for me! I was unable to have any cloth pressed against me, which meant I was in pain even going to the doctor's office to be checked out. Finally I found these shells and wore them with a light bra. The relief was fantastic! I highly recommend them to anyone with raw or tender nipples.
I couldn't stand the feel of my nipples resting against my bra or shirt, so these were a savior.  They have their own problems though... just have to weigh the pros and cons.  The breathing holes allow for milk to leak through when I forget and bend over.  Remember that the opposite breast will let down when you start feeding, and the sponges do not soak up all of my milk.  Also, they irritate my aereolas.
This IS approved for flight according to 14CFR part 21. Even though there are still dangers of having a child in your lap, like the baby getting compressed on impact, a baby being jolted out of a parents arms is much more deadly. The 2009 or older reviews should be ignored anyway. Buy this and visit the website for more info on how to ensure airline staff that it is approved for cruising altitude (not take off or landing which is not clearly explained WHY). Best scenario is to have a separate seat for baby with a child fit harness, but for those who insist on a lap baby...buy this.
Very well made, thick to keep baby warm during flight without having to put bulky sweaters, jackets or blankets.Easily attaches to adult seat belt. Large neck opening doesn't bother baby. Completely adjustable to child's height/length and weight.
We used this for our very busy 18 month old son. It was really helpful and served its purpose - made life a little easier for my husband and me as we were also trying to care for our 3 year old on the flight.
Flying business class they do not allow car seats, so the only choice is to have our baby as a lap child.  We were so happy to find this simple vest that keeps our baby from becoming injured during severe turbulence.  Make sure to get the right size, pay attention to the neck opening size on the vest and measure your baby's head circumference.
I purchased these to attempt to use with my breast pump (Medela Freestyle) to ease the pain and to wear at night. Neither worked. The did not fit on the flanges and I lost a lot of milk when I attempted to use them with the pump. When I attempted to wear them to ease pain and collect breast milk, that also failed. The shape is weird (which means they cannot be worn without being very noticeable) and they seemed to leak no matter what I did. On top of that, they actually made me more sore. I would not recommend purchasing these.
These breastshells are wonderful.  They helped me continue to breastfeed as they eased sore and cracked nipples.  And I love being able to save the breastmilk that leaks out for use later.  Great job, Avent!
I tend to leak all over the place when I'm breast feeding or pumping so these are awesome for catching and saving breast milk.
A must have! Every mother needs this in the first 2 months of breastfeeding. It works very well and It is comfortable and easy to wear.
love those, very useful to calm pain at the beginning and very handy to save milk (and bras) I still would not wear them out in public but great ally for easy breastfeeding and easy to clean!
At first I thought the idea of collecting breastmilk this way was kind of weird, and then I had a baby. I realized how much is lost through letdown on the other side or when you just have an overproduction. I used these a lot in the first few weeks but there is no way you can wear them out of the house, plus its not good to keep the ladies cooped up like that anyhow. I would just pop one in anytime I was going to feed/pump when I was at home. You would be surprised how much gets collected.I just wish they weren't a hard plastic. It would be nice if they were made with a more pliable plastic or silicone.
Unfortunately even when used properly they leaked. I ended up returning these because they didn't do the job. I haven't found a decent alternative so I've been pumping one side as my daughter nurses on the other.
Initially, I purchased the Avent breast pads, thinking they would suffice. However, I found them to be itchy against my already irritated breasts. These breastshells were the answer!!! Not only do they catch all that embarassing leaking milk, but they soothe away irritation!
Maybe good for moms who struggle with breastfeeding but I thought it was really poorly shaped and uncomfortable, there is no way you would ever wear this under clothing outside your own house!
These definitely keep my sore nipples from chafing or sticking to my bra. They look funny thru my shirt, kinda like a pointy Madonna bra, but who cares when you're in agony from cracked nipples?  My only complaint is that I wish I could wear them all the time. The directions say to not wear longer than 40 minutes at a time since they put pressure on your milk ducts. But, I'll take whatever relief I can get!
I bought these and the Medela SoftShell Breast Shells for Sore or Inverted nipples.  I would say the Medela's are better for keeping your bra off your nipples.  They're great if you're sore or want to get more air to your nipples.  The Avent are better for flat or inverted nipples.  I opening of the Avent shells is much smaller so it almost keeps your nipples pushed out, however, the Avent definiately show under your bra much more easily.  The Medela are more shallow and the opening over your nipples is bigger so it's almost as if the nipple and the areola are getting aired out.  Both are comfortable and I forget I'm wearing them.  I use both.  I use the Avent around the house and make the initial latch easier, and I wear the Medela out because they don't show as easily under clothing.  The Avent do come with solid shells too so they can be used to catch milk from the non-nursing breast during letdown too.  If you don't have the solid shells on then remember, don't bend over  :)  The Medela come with little foam absorption pads to catch milk from letdown but you can't really collect milk in the Medela's.  So it really depends on your purpose for the shells.
the shells can be used to collect breastmilk prior to feeding your child. This lets you collect milk for future use and doesn't waste it.
I have a 1 month old and a 2 year old, I wish I'd found these 2 years ago! My nipples are still a little tender to where the weight of my nursing tank is irritating. I also itch a bit and worried about thrush, but when I put these on the itch goes away and since it's plastic, I get a nice cooling effect initially. I've been able to save the milk the shield catches when I leak as baby feeds on other breast. The only thing is I'd never wear these in public as they make a weird shape under the shirt. I don't think I could comfortably wear them inside of a bra either.
Good product for the breast feeding moms. My wife love this product and we always used AVENT products because of the quality and reasonable prices
they r too big an waaaay to obvious to wear. my nipples were very soar, and I tried to wear these things for a day but they kept moving and actually made my pain even worse.
Summary: Works great for collecting leaked breastmilk and thereby minimizing waste; ventilated shells are great relief for injured nipples; appearance drastically improves if worn with a lightly padded braProduct comes with two soft bases (rings fitting around nipple), and two sets of covers: one ventilated (with holes), and one without holes.Pros:- ventilated shells protect irritated or damaged nipples from contact with clothing, reducing irritation and allowing healing without blocking air from the skin- ventilated shells can collect a couple ounces of milk (if you're mindful of the holes at the top)- solid (no hole) shells can collect 2-3 ounces of milk and have convenient pouring spouts- base is shaped pointing out which is desirable for flat nipplesCons:- soft base (ring with hole for the nipple to fit through) can cause skin irritation if left on too long due to moisture accumulation- outward appearance through clothing varies greatly depending on breast size and type of bra used; seems to be designed to contour with size C at most
I was looking forward to collecting any let down breast milk.  After wearing these shells for a night, the silicone shell left these itchy welts on my breasts that haven't gone away after 2 days.  :(.  If you look at the silicone part it has a weird yellow tinge to the silicone.I'm going back to my Medela soft shells.  They were made in Switzerland and the silicone looks clear not yellow tinged.
I bought these to use on one side while my baby ate from the other side because as soon as I get a letdown both sides start squirting milk like crazy. :) I end up saving about 2oz every time I use the shells while I feed my baby so I was able to start my little frozen milk stash.
These shells are very useful, they prevent leaks and save milk. Very easy to clean and put together. AVENT is the best for this kind of thing.
Highly recommended! These are great for those early months of breastfeeding if you have any painful sore, and/or cracked and bleeding nipples. I don't use them now in month 7, but I used them ALOT in the earlier months.
I've had sore nipples and excessive letdown leaking from the minute baby was born, it seems like, and these have been so helpful in dealing with both of those issues.I agree with everyone else: you CANNOT possibly wear these out of the house and hope no one will notice, but for around the house, they're great at what they do! I will second the opinion, too, that these should not be worn for more than 45 mins to an hour, because they do put uncomfortable pressure on the breast, and I did develop a minor plugged duct after forgetting and leaving the vented ones on for a 3 hour nap. While I was able to easily clear the plug, it's easy to avoid if you just remove these within an hour. I'm a 36DD with, apparently, longer nipples, and these work great for me. My nipples get a chance to breathe and heal, and I'm able to save letdown milk!PLEASE NOTE though that since buying these, I also recently switched to wool reusable breast pads (LANAcare, Ekstra style, Medium size overnight and Small size for the day) instead of using the cotton reusable or disposable breast pads I had been using, and I really noticed a HUGE difference in my nipples once I switched to wool. The wool pads contain lanolin, so they soothe the nipple, and because they're not holding the moisture in with plastic (and because wool wicks away moisture so well) it's incredibly healing for the nipples.Using both wool pads AND these breast shells have almost completely cleared up my nipple soreness issue. If you're struggling with clothing or pads feeling painful on your nipples, it's really worth the investment to try the LANAcare wool pads. Plus, the wool is antibacterial, so you only need to wash them every 2-3 weeks! Amazing!
maybe it's because I dont have a long torso but I found this product much more comfortable than the milk saver. Unless breast milk is flowing abundantly, the Avent Breast shells is much more reasonable and cheaper to boot
this is a very useful item to help keep your hands free.  it is a little pricey and my ds doesn't seem to like anyone using this product for him except for me.  kind of annoying.
This is one of those items you must have....I use it when grocery shopping, because realistically you cannot push a shopping cart and a stroller at the same time, nor can you really put the baby in the car seat carrier and have room in the cart for items...  Also great for around the house.  The price is well worth it!
I registered for and received the Fisher Price Secure Embrace. I have been a big fan of Fisher Price products and I figured I would be happy since I had the predecessor to the FP Carrier. Well anyhow I registerd for it because of my previous experience and the price. Big mistake it was the most uncomfortable thing that I could find. I didn't want to spend money on the Baby Bjorn because I figured how much use would it get so why spend or ask a family member to spend that much.  Anyhow needless to say I was very unhappy with the  Fisher Price carrier and then went in search for a replacement. Having a carrier is a great investment for nice walks, shopping and just some cuddle time if you have a colicky baby. I tried out all the other carriers with my son in them to see what was the most comfy for us both. The only one was the Baby Bjorn. I spent the $ and I have to say I haven't regretted it at all.  My son was a month premature and weighed 5lbs and 11 ozs.  He fit in nicely and I was extremely happy with the way that his weight was distributed. My son is now two months old and weighs a total of 12lbs. I carry him around in this a lot and I have to say that I never get any backaches and he never complains from being in it.This is by far the best carrier on the market...believe me I tried them all with the baby in them. I am very glad that I forked out the extra dough for it.
No complaints!  Love this carrier.  Only complain, baby outgrew it.  We did get a lot of use out of it though before that.
This carrier is great, my son loves it. If he's fussy we just put him in it and he calms down immediatly. It's easy to clean and easy to get him in and out of it. I go for a mile walk every day with him in it and it doesn't strain my back.
I found the Baby Bjorn to be a very comfortable way to wear my baby. I was only able to use it for about 4 months because my son was big and it was difficult to carry him when he exceeded 15 lbs. The only reason I do not give this item 5 stars is because, in the front-facing position, my son's arms would often turn blue/purple unless I physically held them up. The material under his armpits somehow cut the circulation off to his arms, and no amount of adjusting his positioning seemed to solve this problem. Otherwise, the carrier was good. I don't believe I used it enough to justify the $90...I sold it on Ebay for $60 though so overall it was a good deal.
I love our baby bjorn, there are some days when our son just wants to be held. So, put the baby in the carrier and you can still get stuff done. Its also helpful while shopping since your hands are free. The only downside is that if you are busty its not always comfortable. But, its still a great item to have.
Who doesn't love a Bjorn?? They are top of the line, high-quality, and as comfortable as baby carriers get. Yes, they're one of the most expensive carriers out there, but their resale value is very high... Check out eBay and you'll notice USED Bjorns going for $50!!Although Bjorns can be used for forward-facing babies or inward-facing babies, it is no longer recommended that you put babies in baby-carriers when they're facing you. For them to "straddle" you, it really isn't good for their soft, developing hip joints, and can cause growing problems and dislocation. It is recommended that when they are so young that they still need to face you, that you use a sling instead. But, once they can hold their head up some, the Bjorn, in my opinion, is much more hassle-free and comfortable than a sling.I find Baby Bjorns most useful at the airport, and other crowded places (the mall, etc.) where you need both of your hands, and don't want the hassle of a stroller.It's also easy for a baby to sleep in the Bjorn, even forward-facing... I would simply roll up a burpcloth or small blanket to prop my baby's cheek and head up, and he could take a full nap in it on a walk.
My daughter LOVED being in this when she was just born - I even cleaned my whole house with her in the Baby Bjorn!  Now I take her on walks facing forward - she loves to see everything.  I will definitely keep this for my next child.
This carrier feels safe when putting the baby in and taking the baby out because of the strong clasps.  It can be shoved in the basket of a stroller because of its soft and small structure, thrown in the wash without worrying about all kinds of special instructions, and used at a moments notice because of its great design.
My baby is 9 months old and I'm glad I have this. I certainly don't use it all the time, and never have, but it can be very useful. It is comfortable to wear for us and baby. Our baby once fell asleep in it on a 3 mile hike in the mountains!I've used the Bjorn in a swimming pool too- just to walk around in the water and let baby get a little wet. It is completely washable in the washing machine!
The carrier is very secure and I have no fear for my baby's safety. It's also very comfortable to carry and once you figure out how to get it together, it's actually very quick and easy. My only problem was when my baby was very young, a month or so, his head was not strong enough and there is a space that allowed his head to fall back somewhat - not a huge amount but enough that I felt the need to supplement with my hand. Overall though, great.
This is my favorite baby product of all times.  We once decided on a whim to take a roadtrip for the weekend when my daughter was 5 months old and i forgot to the the baby bjorn along.  we ended stopping at a target and buying a snuggli for the weekend.  i abslolutely hated it, and my daughter seemed to not be as comfortable as in the baby bjorn.  we then stopped at a babies r us to get another baby bjorn, and were able to enjoy the weekend.  I have used my baby bjorn at least five times a week with my first daughter, for almost a year, and everything ist still intact and i have used it for the past two months with my second daughter.  the color fading a bit from all the use and washing ist all that happened.  Our first daughter would be very fussy in the evening and wanted to be walked through the house for the first couple of months of her live.  I just used the baby bjorn, which still allowed my used of my hands.
When I first bought this and learned how to put it on, and got my crying baby in it, I thought, he's going to hate it. It SEEMED uncomfortable. After 3-4 minutes he got quiet and within minutes of me walking around in my kitchen he was sound asleep! I now bring it to every BBQ, party or get together we attend. I've even been food shopping with it. It is tricky to get them out of it and put them to bed, you do need another persons help..until you get the hang of it. Now I can get him out by myself and lay him down w/out disturbing him. I didnt have one of these for my colicky firstborn and I wished I had. Excellent product.
The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because I think it could use more padding on the straps! When you have a heavy baby and a not so great back it gets hard to carry them in this after awhile! Baby does loves the comfort of this carrier!So I would say it is worth the money!
We have gotten soooo much mileage out of our Baby Bjorn.  Our daughter never really liked being in her infant seat and pushed around in the stroller so this was a lifesaver (sanity-saver) for us.  I used this carrier more than I used her stroller for the first 5 months.At first, my daughter would get in, "head-butt" my chest and get more and more frustrated (as would I) but at around 3 months, she stopped doing this and would just fall asleep.  She loves facing out and looking around and takes naps  this way as well.Both my husband and I have worn this, and been able to get it on - by ourselves.  We've just put it on, leaving one side open, and then placed our daughter in and buckled it up.  No problem.  Only now, that our 5 month-old is 17 lbs, do I find it hard to wear for an extended amount of time.I can throw this in the washer and then line-dry it and it comes up beautifully.If the cost is keeping you away, just keep in mind that you can always resell it and get quite a bit back. Ours came used from a friend with two kids.  It is still safe, secure and will be put away until we have our second baby.
This is a must for any mom!  I received the one that button's vs. snaps in and I would recommend you seek out the Bjorn that snaps.  It is somewhat hard to button on your own.  However, once the baby is in, it's amazing.  When my baby weighed enough (8 lbs. is the minimum I think) we tried it immediately and she loved it.  Now that she can hold her head, she loves to face outward while in the house or on walks.  If we're on a walk and she gets sleepy, we just turn her around and she falls asleep.  This is a must have for moms and dads!!!
I love the Baby Bjorn and often wear it around the house when baby is fussy, since she likes movement and action.Since I would just repeat the praise I've seen here, I wanted to add that I'm a size 18/20 (w/ a large bust in addition) and I have no problems wearing the BB. My husband is also very tall and more of a medium build and the BB fits him just fine too. I assume that other, lower-quality front carriers might not work on larger women (consider that breast-feeding might increase your size right where you'd wear this carrier). Rest assured that this one works beautifully.If you are larger, I think that BB sells expansion straps, which I bet other makers do not.
I got this for the diaper bag and absolutely love it.  I found a few other First Years items (grooming kit, medicine tote, bottle tote) that match in color and are just nice to have.The clippers are invaluable.  Not just for baby, but for me as well.  I can clip a nail on a teeny-weeny hand or I can clip a jagged edge on my own nail. The files really come in handy for this.  Definitely get some of those separately so you can have extras.The thermometer is great.  I have about 3 different &quot;under the tongue/arm&quot; ones that I'm always using.  Results aren't really fast, but considering the price and the fact that most people can't afford an ear thermometer for the diaper bag, it works well enough.The rattle is pretty good.  I got a similar rattle with Winnie-the-Pooh, just to add some variety.The aspirator is good for travel, but get a preemie nasal aspirator for home.  However, I like how you can open this one up and clean it out.  Most that I've seen don't have that feature.The medicine dropper is pretty good.  About average for what you're going to find.  I also have one from the First Years with Big Bird on it.  It doesn't have an end cap, but it works just as well as the one that comes with this set.You can't go wrong with this set, or one like it.  Whether you use it at home or in the diaper bag, just having these little tools all right there is nice.
I really like this set.  It is small and fits nicely into the diaper bag.  I bring it with me because babies always seem to get snags in their nails or a stuffy nose at all the wrong moments.  This set has it all.  When I travel I am comfortable with it because it has it all.  A rattle to play, a thermometer, a ball syringe.  I love it.  That ball syringe is the best thing for a baby with a stuffy nose.  This is great because you don't need a separate grooming set and separate first aid type things.  It is all in one pack.
I love this case, it has everything you need in ine handy case.  The nose sucky is the best one we have including better than the hospital one, it always works without repeated effort, which is very important when you have a squirming infant!
I received this shade for free when I bought other products from Babies R US.My windows in the back have a curved edge to them.  You have to place the shade high on the window in the straight area.  Well you miss the whole lower corner of the window.  The sun shines in through this lower corner.  When I tried to move the shade lower on the window I could not fully close the window.If you can get it for free, get it.  Do not purchase this item.I just recently went out and purchased new shade for my car to cover the corner this shade misses.
We've had several other brands, got this for free with a coupon, and like it best. The retraction spring lasts longer than the more expensive brands. Yes, it's annoying that it's free advertising for BabiesRUs, but this shade has stood the test of time, so it gets our vote.
Got these for my baby shower & installed them in my car...they do not block the sunlight at all from the car--might as well have nothing there for all the good they do.  And the worst part is that the support on the bottom of the shade is flimsy plastic & bent within a month from the pressure of being attached by one suction cup so that there are "wings" pointing into my car.  Terrible product & I am replacing them with a better brand.  I will definitely read the reviews first this time!!
I had recieved this as a promotional item at Babiesrus so I didn't have to pay anything for it.  Well, I got what I DIDN'T pay for!!!  This thing does not stick to car windows and even if I made it stick, it would fall down before we even got out of the garage.  Looking at the price of this item, it's better to just spend a few extra $$$ and get something that will actually work..
I have four kinds of baby spoon (sassy, gerber, toss'n'go, and these) and these meal mates spoons are my very favorite.I have been using these spoons for two months, from my baby's age of 6 mo to 8 mo.Pros:The most comfortable spoon in my hand, well-balanced, no sharp edges, not fatiguing like the sassy spoons and gerberA good shape for my baby's mouth, don't lose food on the way inHold just the right amount of food, I like a spoon that isn't too bigBright and cheerful colorsDishwasher safe, I have not observed any staining or bleaching from the dishwasherNice weight, not too lightCons:Yes, carrots do stain them.  Maybe reserve the orange one for carrots?  I really don't care about this, so I use them all for carrotsFood can build up around the back edge of the plastic coating.  If you're hand-washing, be aware of this spotNot great for travel because they're heavyAs for the other spoons I have:The plastic toss'n'go spoons are best for traveling because they're light and indestructible.  They are nicely proportioned for little mouths.The gerber spoons are fine, but not as comfortable or well-balanced as the meal mates.I really don't like the sassy spoons.  They do have the advantage of an extra long handle and they change color with temperature, but the plastic coating is too thick and too soft, and the spoon is uncomfortable to hold.  Worst of all, I find the sassy spoons taste like plastic,  Yuck.I'd trade them all in for these meal mates spoons.  I just like these spoons best.  A good, simple implement.
The basin on these spoons is so shallow that you can hardly get any food on them.  It is a mess waiting to happen.  Save your money and don't buy these.  I use them for one thing and that is decoration of my son's spoon cup.  They are lively and bright little spoons and much shorter than his others so they make a great decoration.  I think that saying a spoon's best use is as a decoration says it all.
I initially tried the Avent wide-neck bottles for my newborn and didn't like them. Those bottles leaked, the nipples gave my son suction blisters on his lips, he needed extensive burping, I didn't find the graduations on the bottles to correlate with any other measures at home and my son seemed to have a hard time getting a hang of how to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in the Avent bottles. Dr Browns bottles solved all these issues. I am extremely happy with them.You need to get used to washing the small parts but once you have a routine going it's well worth the effort. It takes me under 20 minutes to wash six bottles (I prefer not to use the dishwasher). The small brush which comes in the starter kit and the multi-pack varieties is essential for cleaning and lasts for about 6-8 weeks of regular use. I recommend going straight for the 8oz bottles and buy the 9-pack which is available at other websites. When warming these bottles, if you find the fluid going up into the vent, just loosen the collar, the column of liquid goes back down and tighten again. If breastmilk is stored in these bottles in the fridge, the fat content does tend to stick to the plastic of the vent. You will receive Level-1 nipples with the starter kit/multi-packs, however you may want to graduate to Level-2 at 3-months of age, Level-2 at 6-months of age and the Y-cut nipples for any thick liquids (e.g milk with cereal).  The caps snap on loudly which is the only 'con' I can think of. Use the travel disc to avoid leakage when transporting milk.My friend's babies with refulx did well on these bottles. My son doesn't have reflux but I can't imagine using any other bottle for him. Highly recommend them and would definitely buy again
These are wonderful.  They are sturdy and practically spill proof.  My daughter is breast fed and these bottles are wonderful for her.  We have used other bottles, and there are a few that she will use, but it takes a little to get her to feed.  She just starts right away with these, plus she doesn't seem to get any air when eating.  She can feed longer without having to be burped.  Just like breastfeeding.  Also, they are less messy.  When she uses other bottles I have to put a bib on her to catch all the milk that leaks out all over her face.  The nipples on these bottles are small and fit great in her mouth.  She doesn't leak milk out with these.  She isn't collacky or have reflux so I can't comment on that, but boy are they great for breastfed babies.  I love being able to give her breast milk in public and not have to stop and sit down and be descreet while lifting my shirt......(you know)  I can just feed her right in her seat while pushing the cart since is works great while upright.
these are the greatest invention in bottles...ever.....these bottles helped my daughter so much....no more gas,no spills or leaks...the only downside is they are hard to clean..but who cares....
My baby has reflux and extra gas just makes him completely miserable. We got these bottles when he was 3-weeks old and they really do make a difference! I'm a pediatrician, so I was a skeptic when I read that the bottle claimed to reduce gas/colic. But I think I'm convinced! At the very least, it makes it easier for him to eat since there is no negative pressure created from suction... the food just flows! Thus, the baby swallows less air from the having work so hard to get food. If your baby has reflux or is very gassy, this bottle is definitely worth a try!
After 6 weeks of plugged ducts, engorged breasts, and painfully raw nipples, these were the only shields that offered some sort of reprieve. I tried 4 different brands and these were by far my favorite. They had a nice stiff nipple so that you could get really good suction (no worrying that they were going to get sucked into the baby's mouth) and the shape allowed for the most skin to skin contact. Overall, a wonderful purchase!
A lot of lacting consultants hold off on recommending to use this products. I think it is a must after a couple of days or the second day of having the baby. Prevent before being sorry. This product was very helpful until I created resistance.
For my last child I had to use nipple shields for a while and they worked fine.  I don't know if my experience is unique- but I just ordered these with my second child and they were far to big for her- they made her gag.  Could not continue use of product.
I got these thinking they were the same size as other brands size small.. Boy was I wrong they are smaller than extra small sizes in other brands.. So buyer bewear! But they are good shelds, they work good and stay in place.
Nipple shields in general are hard to use, but these were nearly impossible. It's a great idea to have so much open space to allow for more mouth to skin contact from the baby, but I just couldn't get them to stay on because there was so little area around the shield. If you're a pro at using shields, then these are probably great. I just couldn't get the hang of them.
Not all nipple shields are created equal... these don't stay on very well, they are thick (not nipple like) and large. Just fork up the money for a Medela shield...
These shields are durable, easy to clean, handy to take along when out and about, and very easy to use. Our son was born a bit on the small side and I'm very large-chested so a shield was a necessity. At two months in we are still using it until he grows a little bit more. The shields we received from the hospital had a round plastic base that would NOT stay stuck on, would leak milk, and was hard to keep off our son's nose. These, on the other hand are easy to use with one hand, keeps the plastic off his nose, and stays in place better without leaking. Plus, because they're not very expensive, we have tons of them so we have a couple for the diaper bag, a couple for the downstairs nursing station, and a couple for the nursery, plus if we accidentally leave one at the pediatrician or something, it's not a tragedy.
Horrible! Too deep..
These nipple shields were the best ones that I tried. I like that they aren't a full circle so the baby's nose wasn't being covered with plastic when he was feeding. It was really nice to have at the beginning but once we were able to feed without it I was definitely glad to get rid of it! :) The one downside was that my little one would grab hold and pull it off and get milk everywhere. However, I think that would be any nipple shield. Definitely would recommend if you are in need of some additional assistance with latching.
These are great for when you first start nursing and your nipples are sore.  However, I found the nipple part to be pretty big for my newborn, reaching all the way to the back of his throat.  It was pretty awkward for him, but he still managed to nurse and I didn't feel any pain!  I only needed these for a day to heal enough, but they were worth it.
This and the Medela shields are must haves for some nursing mothers.  You gotta love the BPA free material.  I would give it five stars but sometimes it doesn't stay on the nipple well.
From what I've seen, there are basically 3 methods used to eliminate/reduce gas in bottles: collapsible liners, one-way vents, and open airways. We've tried various brands that use all 3 methods. These bottles are an example of one-way vents - the base is designed to let air flow in but prevent fluid from flowing out in the opposite direction. They do an OK job preventing bubbles in the formula, but they have two main problems: 1) they tend to leak if you don't assemble correctly, and also if shaken or if the membrane becomes a bit worn. 2) The design of the vent requires some negative pressure to allow the air to flow into the bottle. This means a slight resistance to your baby's suckling effort. The last thing you want when addressing any feeding problem is resistance to your baby's suckling.We found the most effective feeding design is the open airway used by Dr Browns bottles. So if you're looking for something to address a colic/feeding problem, that's the way to go. But as previously mentioned, the best advice is to buy one of each and find what works for your little one.
We purchased these when our son was about a month old. he had colic and gas problems even after we switched him to gentle ease formula, We had to give him gas drops after every feeding and sometimes it did not help. We purchased these and within three days he had no gas and the colic was alot better. We love these and plan to use them with every child we have. They are a hassle to put togather in the middle of the night so i assemble and fill mine with water after i wash them and just add formula when needed. Little tip rince them out after each use and rince other dishes well when washing in the dishwasher togather because they will discolor. Well worth the hassle though :o)
We really like these bottles - we have had to burp our baby much less since we switched to them.  I noticed an earlier review had complaints about warming the bottles - we have no problems warming the bottles in our bottle warmer, and the only package warning I have seen is to remove the nipple before warming, which we do.  The bottles are extremely easy to clean - we hand wash the tops and removable bottoms and put the bottle bodies in the dishwasher and have had no problems.My only complaint is that some of the bottles have the ounces printed in colored ink on the side of the bottle instead of the ounces being molded into the clear plastic.  The bottles with the clear plastic molded numbers have more precision (showing mL and ounces to smaller units instead of only having markers every two ounces as the colored ink bottles do).  Not to mention, with the clear plastic molded numbers, I don't have to hunt to find a bottle body to match the top and bottom - I have enough trouble finding socks to match my son's outfit, I don't want to worry about matching bottle bodies to the tops and bottoms!
I started to prefer these bottles when my daughter was born in 2005.  I've had 2 more children (one in 2008 and the other in 2012), and each time we will try out different (and pricier) options before confirming once again, these are the bottles  we prefer.  They are easy to find, our babies have never had issues with spitting up or gas and they do not leak.  My infant easily goes back and forth from this bottle to breast.You will have to disassemble these down to clean them properly.  Some prefer this, but I find it a little annoying.  I continue to purchase these for my son.  This set comes with three bottles, nipples and caps., and is perfect from about four months on.
When I first saw this, I was sure that it would leak, but it just seemed like sure an innovative idea that I bought one anyway.I unscrewed the nipple ring and the bottom of the bottle.  I was so sure that it would leak if I put anything liquid in it.  I filled the bottle full of water and tossed it around on a white sheet to see if it leaked.  It didn't, but I still wasn't sure.So, I washed the bottle in hot water.  I've noticed that some bottles leak after being washed.  Then, I tried the sheet experiment again.  It didn't leak. This bottle is 9 months old and still hasn't leaked!
I've got a 2 week old.  We started with the Playtex Nurser Bottles.  Great bottles, but the nipple was way too large for my son's mouth and he got a blister on his top lip.  So I tried Gerber for newborns...smaller nipple, but more bubbles and gas for baby.  So I bought this VentAire because it has a smaller nipple AND is good for gas.  But my son sucked on it for 5 minutes and got nothing out of it.  Then I realized that the nipple doesn't just have a hole in it like other bottles do.  It has the slit-type hole, and the baby has to be squeezing the very tip if anything's going to come out.  Well babies don't suck that way.  They suck at the wider part, naturally.  But we solved our problem by taking the nipple off of the Gerber bottle and use it on the VentAire bottle.  (They tell you not to do this.) But it works perfectly now...no gas, no sucking problems.  Whew!
These bottles are wonderful. We have never had any problems with feeding, she drinks just fine. The newborn nipples were too slow for her, so we just got the next stage a little earlier. They are easy to clean.Only complaint I have is that traditional bottle warmers don't work well with these because the bottoms are removeable. It took so long to heat up one bottle that we just started making a new bottle almost every time, or sticking the bottle in a bowl of hot water.
We received this set free from Amazon for the new baby. However, we bought Playtex bottles for the first 2 kids. My wife is a Family Nurse Practitioner and she considers this type of bottles the best for our kids. The main reason? When the baby drinks her milk out of the bottle, pressure builds up inside. With regular bottles, it is very easy for the silicone/plastic nipple to contract so it makes up for the milk that was taken out. That in turn makes it hard for the baby to continue drinking. One solution would be to constantly turn the regular bottle or just take it out and pull the nipple out once in a while. With this Playtex set, you do not have to worry about it. It is very convenient and the nipple does not get stuck to the bottle. The only potential downside is having more pieces to clean - as each bottle has 2 extra pieces to help with the pressure flow on the bottom. This is definitely recommended. We prefer this set for kids 1 year and older, versus the bulky infant ones, as the kids can actually hold the bottle themselves.
When i used other bottles. The nipple use to come close and stop the flow of milk. But these bottle are amazing. I was so worried for my daughter. She use to drink 2-3 oz milk even at age of 4 month. Suddenly the day i used this bottle, she drank 6 oz at once. Thanks for this product.
I originally registered for (and received) the avent bottles.  They were horrible because they leaked (you can't over tighten or under tighten and all sorts of other finicky things) and they also left my baby with lots of gas where he would cry violently.  Horrible to watch. I tried several other bottles and still wasn't happy with them.  My girlfriend kept on telling me to try these but I was skeptical becuase people said that they leaked.  well anyhow I was at my whits end and hurting for my son so I decided to try them. I do have to say that the stage one nipple is hard to get anything out of. But I did use the stage two nipple and it's been great.  He will occasionally have to burp but it's quick and painless.  Most times he doesn't have to burp afterwards.  There is no spillage from the side of his mouth and he will drink his milk straight and not have to be burped half way so that he can finish eating.  I have never had the bottles leak because I washed them all and assembled them and left them like that. I do clean them after every usage with soap and water.  Then once a week I take them apart, sterilize the bottles in the sterilizer and boil the nipples and disc. I immediately reassemble them and then test them with water to see if they are leaking.  I think that you will run into leaks if you try to assemble them as you are ready to use them and are rushing because the baby is hungry.I wish that I could give these bottles more than five stars.  I should have listened to my friend sooner.  Her baby suffered from Acid Reflux and this bottles worked great for him.
I'm a dad of 14 month old twins.  I PROMISE you one thing - these bottles are purchased only by first time parents (like me).  Anyone who's on their second or third would tell you to save your money.I realize that every child is different, and some burp up more than others - but they ALL burp up and they ALL get gas.  Some more than others.Parents get so frustrated and worried about their babies that they try ANYTHING different.  One thing seems to 'do the trick' when the problem was ready to stop on its own.We tried every bottle gimmick sold on Babies-R-Us.  On the third use of this one, the bottom came loose, and there was formula everywhere.Since our twins were 2 months, we have been using the plain old Evenflo bottles from any grocer.  They cost about 99 cents each.They work great.  There's a bottle, ring and nipple.  All of the gimmick bottles have half a dozen parts that need to be individually cleaned, or come apart, or leak.Think about it - Playtex, Gerber, Avent, Evenflo - they all sell the same simple three-piece bottle, but they also sell some sort of state-of-the-art bottle that's supposed to cure all of your baby's ills.  So how could they in good conscience continue to sell those cheap, gas-inducing, old-fashioned bottles?Because they work; because all of the repeat parents buy them; and because all new parents eventually need to buy a bottle that does what it's supposed to.
These bottles are the coolest.  The fit in your hand really well.  They are bent to go into the babies mouth at the correct angle.  The venting means a lot less gas and there is NO messy bag to have to mess with and squeeze the air out of.
I really do like these bottles but they do leak out the bottome sometimes.  I have discovered if I let the bottle air dry after washing instead of putting it together it doesn't leak.  I also like that the nipple does not collapse like some bottles do.  These came with the fast flow so I had to purchase the medium flow as well since my little ones isn't quite ready for fast flow.
While baby bottles with drop-in liners are convenient when traveling to see relatives and friends, these Ventaire bottles work much better at home.Likes:>Innovative bottom vents (read instructions carefully) help reduce risks for gas, spit-up, and colic.  Our baby had no problems using these Ventaire bottles with the fast flow nipples on the first try.>Bottom vents also help milk flow without vacuum build-up.>Angled design reduces chances for ear infections because the baby is sitting more upright rather than on their backs.>Easy to use, clean, and sterilize (boil nipples and vents in water for 5 minutes once a week) with the removable tops and bottoms at home.  The bottle itself just requires hot soapy water for disinfection.>Compatible with Playtex Nursing Necessities breast pumps to help store breast milk.>Convenient, BPA free 6oz. and 9oz. sizes.Dislikes:>Babies' milk flow rate preferences vary widely so different flow speed (fast or slow) nipples may be required.>Instructions warned, "Do not microwave" to prevent uneven heating of milk which may cause injuries.  It doesn't seem like the bottle itself is compatible withPhilips AVENT Microwave Steam Sterilizer(nipples and vents are boilable).  Will need to consult with Playtex customer support for clarification.Bottom Line:Good, effective, innovative bottles to minimize complications (gas, spit-up, colic, and ear infections) from nursing with bottles.  Easy to clean and disinfect bottle (hot soapy water); sterilize nipples and vents (boilable) at home.
I have been faithful to the Dr. Brown bottles, but had heard good things about these as well and was interested to try them.  I do like the angle of the bottles for one, as you do not have to tilt the bottle as much.  This helped my daughter to actually control the flow better instead of not enough or too much coming at her.  I did not notice a huge difference in terms of less gas between this bottle and the Dr. Browns, which also do a great job with that.  I both like and dislike that the bottom screws off.  Although it is nice for cleaning purposes, if not put on well or too tightly they leak out of the bottom!  With that said, I am not sure it is worth the extra mess potential to be able to take it off for cleaning...that is what a bottle brush is for!  They are only slightly cheaper than Dr. Browns, so I would still opt for those over these Playtex VentAire, but they are a great second option.
I don't necessarily know if these bottles work for colic because my son did not have that BUT these bottles did eliminate him gulping so much air like he was with different bottles.  With other bottles he would choke himself and swallow too much air which made for a very cranky kid.  Skip all the other fancy, more expensive bottles and try these.
These bottles work nice and are a good option to try for babies who are having problems with fussiness or gas.  They seem to reduce the amount of bubbles and make the feedings easier for our little one.  (We also use the Doctor Brown bottles).  I haven't noticed a big difference in performance between the two, but these are easier to clean.
The vent in the bottom of the bottle makes it very easy for baby to extract milk. The flow is fast and furious which is good if your baby has trouble feeding from non-vented bottles. However, the high flow can overflow the capacity of my baby's mouth (&lt; 2mo old) which leads to messiness.Other drawbacks are that occasionally the vent holes leak. There are also many different parts that need to be disassembled for cleaning.I have both the "wide" and "standard" versions and there isn't any difference when it comes to feeding. The nipples are basically the same and my baby has no preference. I prefer the wide version because it is shorter (&lt;7") which makes it easier to fit into wall cabinets.As far as reducing gas, I haven't noticed any difference between these bottles andThe First Years Breastflow Bottlewhich I also use. I typically prefer The First Years bottle because of the slower flow. However, this may not be a problem once my baby gets bigger.UPDATE: After using this for a couple months, I find it is too much of a pain to deal with the multiple different seals and rings. It makes cleaning and assembling more difficult and there don't seem to be any obvious benefits to it compared to simpler bottles.
got the newborn set....and now that the grand baby is a little older...my daughter is using these and absolutely loves them....no gas attacks from the wee one.  Easy for mom to hold....and well...the baby drips his formula down to the last drop.
I am currently expecting my first baby so I ordered these to be prepared, however I haven't used them yet.  I did open the box up and they are really easy to put together and when filled with water they didn't leak at all.  I can say they are much more comfortable in your hand than the Avent bottles.  Also, the price can't be beat!  They appear to be very easy to clean without a lot of nooks and crannies for milk to hide in that you have to scrub out.
I switched to these bottles after using very basic style bottles (similar to the style of bottle and nipple used in the hospital with my daughter) when noticing my daughter was having more difficulty controlling the milk flow and subsequently choking - of note, my daughter was born very premature and took some time to learn how to eat properly.  What grabbed me on these was the claim that baby can comfortably control the milk flow due to the special venting system, as well as less gas for baby.  Baby definitely seems to do better with these bottles, less dribbling of milk out of her mouth around the nipple, very little choking episodes (again, this is related to her prematurity), and seems much more content after her feeds so clearly less gas.The bottles are easy to hold, lightweight, and easy to clean.  I mostly handwash, and others have pointed out it's a pain given all the parts to the bottle, but I don't find it troublesome at all.  Actually, since both the top and bottle come off, the bottle part itself is just basically a tube that is very easy to clean (no special bottle brush needed).  Assembly is simple, but in order for the vent to work 100%, the parts must be bone dry, the silicone vent must sit on the bottom perfectly and screwed on tight, and the nipple part pulled tightly against the ring to ensure no leaks.  I have also encountered a problem on occasion where there seems to be a vacuum created and milk would no flow throw the nipple.  Imagine my surprise at noticing that baby was sucking away for at least 5 minutes before I realized what was going on there- but just a quick readjustment of the parts and suddenly the flow of the milk was working again.I'd recommend these, especially if you are looking for a bottle that helps baby control the milk flow.EDIT 12/16/11: Now that my daughter is 6 months, and I have a few months more experience with these bottles, I have to increase from 4 star review to a 5 star review.  Cleaning is a breeze (I mostly handwash, but on occasion I throw them in the dishwasher, either way gets them very clean).  Also, we have gone up to the moderate flow nipple and we have not encountered the vacuum problem where she was unable to get any milk through.  In hindsight, this may not have been the bottle but rather my daughter given she was a preemie and at the time of the original review still had some feeding difficulties.  She also has reflux, and these bottles have really helped with decreasing the amount of air she swallows.I am very happy with these bottles and highly recommend them to the pricier brands out there that make the same claims.
The wide version of this is the first bottle we tried with our then-3-week-old baby. She had been exclusively breastfed up until that point, but I had started pumping in preparation for going back to work, so we wanted to try her on a bottle. She immediately went for it with no problems! Now, she never had any latching problems anyway, but I was concerned she'd be confused by the bottle. She's still not had many bottles, but had no problem switching back to breast after. We also have AVENT bottles that we have yet to try, but I think the WIDE VentAire will be what we send with her sitter and leave with dad when I'm not around to feed her. The standard size I think would be great for non-breastfed babies, but I still do prefer the wide.She was more gassy than normal after her feeding, but from what I hear a bottle will always make them more gassy than the boob - so I guess this bottle is better than others (can't compare there). The only real bad thing I can say is that there are a lot of little parts with the screw-on bottom and vent piece (they do give you one extra vent in the pack in case you lose one). That's a necessary evil of the vent setup though, I guess. I do like that they open up at both ends - makes cleaning pretty easy.
These are great for bigger feedings. We decided to skip the 6 ounce bottles and use the 9 ounce for all stages. We did however need to replace the fast flow nipples that come with the bottles with some slow flow ones.It was just better to get the bigger size since babies outgrow the smaller size so quickly. It allowed us to future proof our bottle needs.
My daughter couldn't get anything out of this bottle and it frustrated her. I thought at first it was bc we were trying to introduce her to the bottle (she used one when first born until I got my mastitis under control but we didn't keep up with it) at first she used avent, I liked those bottles but she refused them later on. She tried so hard with this bottle where she wouldn't give advent a chance. Same as many others I read on here, half hour she got half an ounce. We got dr browns and instant success! There's something that doesn't set well with me when you aren't supposed to steam sterilize this bottle. It's junk, and I'm glad to see it wasn't just my daughter struggling to drink from this bottle. I am only trying to get her on a bottle bc i have to get my wisdom teeth pulled and won't be able to nurse her for 24hrs. It'll also be handy to be able to pump and bottle feed her when we move in a couple weeks. Go with Dr browns if you are transitioning your baby to a bottle, you won't be sorry!
two years later, still have them. they are good quality and durable. recomment them for anybody looking for a set of bottles.
As a first time Mommy, I researched everything on Amazon.com before I bought my baby stuff.  If you're one of those new Mommy's doing the same thing, you'll notice when researching bottles that everyone loves or hates almost every kind of bottle!I bought a sample of all different 4-6 oz. sizes of different bottle brands to see which one my newborn would like best and finally narrowed it down to this Playtex Ventaire Standard 6 oz. bottle.  My baby preferred the nipple of this bottle and also had less gas and spit-ups after feedings from it.  The smaller nipple is easier for her to latch onto and the flow of the nipple is perfect so she isn't dribbling all over. Even other small nipples on other bottle brands seemed to have a faster flow that would cause her to dribble.The bottles and parts fit inside my Advent Microwave Steam Sterilizer, too.  The only thing that's not convenient about this bottle is it has several parts/pieces to it, so you have to take the whole thing apart and make sure to wash/sterilize/dry everything before putting it back together for the next feeding. But that just comes with the territory...nothing you can do about that. Playtex also sells a Ventaire bottle that has a wide nipple but my baby didn't take well to wide nipples--I think those may work better for breastfed babies to help alleviate nipple confusion.The only thing I'm not looking forward to is having to eventually move up to the 9 oz. bottle simply because those DON'T fit in my bottle sterilizer.But this product was the winner in our home!
We had trouble the first few days we tried using these, but then I figured out that after each cleaning (and before the first use) you have to stretch out the rubber vent at the bottom.  Since we figured that out, these bottles have been perfect.  They only leaked once - and that was when we didn't screw on the bottom completely.  And since we've been using them, our daughter has less gas, she spits up less, and we don't even use a bib when we feed her now.  We've had no problems with the stage 1 nipple, and since we started using these we've tried a few other bottles - Avent, Gerber - but none compare to this.  I highly recommend it.
My seven-month-old has been bottle fed since about 1-week-old. We started with the Playtex Drop-ins.  I have been very happy with those bottles, but sometimes I hate dealing with the inserts.  These are the narrow nipple unlike the drop-ins, so the nipples are not interchangeable.  I do like these because the top will screw directly onto a ready-to-feed bottle (I use Similac) and I don't have to use one-time use nipples.I was really hoping the bottle would be easier for my son to hold on to since it is angled, but I think he just likes me holding it, so he has yet to hold the bottle himself.  I do find it much easier for me to hold when he is laying down because I can move around and it fits perfectly under my chin or it sits at he correct angle without me having to hold it at all unlike a straight bottle that falls over easily.The bottle unscrews at both the top and the bottom.  The bottom has a seal in it that pops out easily and is simple to clean.  They wash up quickly.  The bottles do not fit into my Avent microwave sterilizer.  They are just a little too tall for it.My one complaint is that the bottles come with fast-flow nipples.  My son is a medium-flow bottle eater.  Fast is just too fast for him.  He moved up to the medium at 2.5 months, but I don't see him moving up any time soon. I would prefer they come with medium since that would be used more frequently to begin with when moving up to the larger bottles.Overall, a great bottle.  I suggest picking up some medium-flow nipples if your little one has been using slow-flow since fast-flow can be a big jump.  If I had to choose between this one and the wide bottle, I would pick the wide.  My son's mouth fits better over the larger nipple.
We have tried all kinds of bottles and these ones work the best for our little one. She is able to latch onto them better than others and they seem to help with gas. Sometimes water drips out, but I think it's from not sealing the ring properly in the bottom when we assemble them. It's not a big deal. As a side note, I was hoping to receive a pack of mixed colors as described, but both packs were all blue. As I have a baby girl, I was hoping for some pink, yellow or white. But, the important thing is that she have the right type of bottles.
I put these bottles in between the regular bottles and the Dr. Brown bottles.  The vents I feel do help with the baby ingesting air but these bottles are no where close to competing with the Dr. Brown bottles.  The downfall of the Dr. Brown bottles is the cleanup of them.  These are much easier to clean.
I like these bottles, they are the only ones my son will accept right now.  After trying everything from avent to gerber these are the ones he uses best.  In the beginning the nipples are closed so nothing comes out i found.  All i did was stick something through the hole so liquid will come out.  YOu can stick it through too far or it will leak, but you can do it just enough that it wont leak and the baby gets milk.My baby still spits up, but not as bad.  And we dont have the problem with collapsed nipples like we did with the Gerber New Traditions and Gerber COmfort Hold...  I tired the Natural SHape Ventaire and my son didnt like those...  He was suckign really hard and nothing was coming out, even after trying to "open" the nipple hole.. But thats ok.. He still loves these ones!
My favorite bottles.  My son had belly issues with gas before we started using these.  They do not require bags and we easily wash them up by hand (they do have a few peices parts).  They do come in random colors, so my son does drink out of pink bottles sometimes, but he doesn't mind.  It can be hard to find the slim version in stores, so these are a good find.
these bottles are really good. the bottle is nicely shaped for good flow to the nipple and into the baby's mouth with out much air. which means less spit ups
These bottles are exceptional and do everything they claim they do. They are a natural shape and make it easy to feed the child. The ventaire system does significantly reduce the amount of bubbles, which means less gas, burps and a happier baby. They are easy to clean, and I love the fact they have covers to keep the nipples free of dirt/dust, etc. Overall, a great set of three starter bottles for twelve dollars. I highly recommend.
After buying ten packs(on top of the ones that came with the bottles) of the nipples for these bottles, we gave up and used our Advent bottles that we didn't want to use.  For some reason, no matter which store purchased at, every nipple (Stage 1 and Stage 2) seemed to not be opened to allow milk to come out.  Our daughter has some serious suction, so I thought that the Stage 1 was already outgrown and tried the 2.  These bottles and nipples have been just a waste of money for us.  I am sure that I can use a straight pin and open them more, but "you're not supposed to"...
I tried these bottles before Dr. Brown's to try to cut down on the amount of air my son was taking in.  They did seem to help a lot with his gas, and are much easier to clean than Dr. Brown's.  I experienced no leaking with these, and my son seemed fine with using them.  The only issue I had was with the nipples collapsing during the feeding.  I don't know why, but the nipples just seem flimsier than Dr. Brown's and my son often had to stop eating because they would collapse.These are easy to wash, easy to assemble, and the curved design is very convienient.  Other than the nipples, they were fine.
I loved these bottles with my first child. I nursed my son and then pumped when I had to return back to work. This was the only bottle/nipple he would take. Two years later, I got them back out for our second child and he has no difficulty. He is also a breastfed baby.As far as people complaining about all the parts, it takes two seconds to clean them. I am not really sure what people are complaining about. They are also all dishwasher safe. I put mine a dishwasher compartment for small items that I bought at a store. Before I had a dishwasher, I hand washed them and it was no big deal!And  I have never had a leak from these bottles!QUESTION? Does anyone know if these bottles (i guess you'd callit the old model)are compatible with the new "natural shape" nipple, I can't find the old style in my local store?
Love these bottles, and they seem to have been DC'ed, so we were thrilled to find them available on amazon!  They work well for our gassy twins, who also have acid reflux.  These are perfect for out needs!
These bottles are incredible :) They are so easy to clean, you just take both ends off and they clean up so nice. The way these bottles are shaped the babies don't seem to get gas and they won't leak. Love Love Love :)
my baby went from nursing to bottles and back to nursing. when I.pumped I got two sets of these. they keep air out of tummy like thwy say. worked
It took a little bit to get used to the shape, it didn't work as well for my son when he held the bottle himself, but when I hold it, the angle makes it easier to prop up when you need that hand to quick scratch an itch or mop a dribble.  The best part is the removable bottom which really lets you get in there easily to wash them out.  The seals have held fine after many washes.
If you are anything like me, you've been searching for the perfect bottle.  The one that controls gas and colic.  The one that doesn't leak.  The one that's easy to hold and drink from.  The one that comes at a good, really good, price.  Well, here you are!  My son is 1, and my only regret is that I didn't buy these sooner.  I used Dr. Browns, Avent, etc.  I bought into the fact that the more expensive bottle systems were the only way to go.  Boy was I wrong.  I wish we'd used these bottles from the very beginning-- through my sons severe reflux and all!!  If you're a new mom, or even just a frustrated mom, BUY THESE BOTTLES!!P.S.  As another reviewer suggested:  Make sure you seal the bottom ring to the bottom cap when the parts are wet to ensure a good seal.  I've done this for 3 months now and not a single, itty bitty leak!!!
I loved these bottles. My son used them for the whole duration.They were super easy to clean and that is such a plus! Nipples are easy to interchange and we could not have been happier.
I love these bottles. My baby loves them as well just because they are easy to grab and the curved bottle helps in getting all the milk. Cleaning is bit painful as you have to remove all these attachments, but considering the benefits I don't mind some extra work.
These bottles were recommended by a friend. We initially bought the 6 oz size. IMHO spare the hassle and just buy the bigger size since the kid will outgrow the small size within a couple of months. My 2 month old daughter went from drinking 3-4 oz per feeding to about 5 ounces and after adding the water and formula there isnt any room left to shake the bottle to mix the formula nicely.
We  have been using the drop in liner system and it was a nightmare, dealing with never knowing how much milk was there, liners pulling free from the bottle and leaking every where etc. These bottles are a bit improvement on that. It can get a bit tedious washing a bottle with 6 parts ( Bottle, nipple, nipple ring, bottom ring, silicone vent, cap) but overall I would say its worth it.
Bottles are a babies personal preference.  My child is breastfed, and occasionally receives a bottle.Since all babies are different it sometimes takes a few bottles to figure out which work the best for your kid.We started out with Dr. Browns, and they made my daughter gassy.  I bought Nuk, and she didn't seem to like them.  I then bought Adiri bottles and they were great...until about the 6th wash when they started to smell and go weird.  This is when my gf said "I really love Playtex Ventaires...maybe you should try them"  These bottles are among the cheaper on the market so getting a single bottle (about $5) was no big deal.My daughter LOVED them.  We've never had gas or stomach issues, they're reliable bottles that don't leak and despite the "washer" piece they really aren't a pain to clean.  They're also impressively cheap and very easy to find.If you're searching for a great bottle, try this one!
My daughter is one year old & these have turned out to be my bottle of choice.  I have all kinds, Medela, Medela Calma & Dr. Brown's both big & small but these just work great.  The size is perfect, big enough but not huge, the shape is easy for her to hold herself even when the milk is getting low and she is tired.  They don't leak, they don't require multiple parts to work which makes it easy for someone else to fix a bottle (or just a hurried, tired mom).  They are a good value as well. I recommend them.
I have a son that has tummy issues, including a whole lot of gas. We've had a lot of success with the Dr. Brown's bottles, but they're expensive, so we wanted to give these a try.One of the selling features is "no bubbles," meaning the baby isn't inhaling air as he eats. The curved design is supposed to prevent them. Well, my son's bottle was filled with bubbles as he ate! I watched them begin in the nipple and travel into the bottle, so with that first feeding I was pretty nervous as to how his stomach would be after eating. He had no problems.After using the bottles for a week, bubbles and all, his gas problems have not gotten worse, though I wouldn't say he's necessarily improved either. I was really impressed! Definitely a cheaper alternative to the Dr.Brown's bottles.My one "complaint" is that there's a lot of pieces in these bottles which makes it a bit annoying to clean, but it's not so bad. And if my son is comfortable, definitely worth it!
These bottles seem very well made.  And I really like the size, design and concept of these bottles.  Once I have had time to assess the prevention of colic, gas and ear aches, I will update this post.
Keeps gas at a minimum and are easy to prep.  I like how they fit perfectly in my nephews mouth and the crook of my arm as he is feeding.  The only drawback I experienced is that with so many parts to clean (it breaks down to five parts), clean up can be cumbersome.
Of course I had bottles given to me and bottles that were purchased for me for my baby shower, and nome of them worked well. After my daughter was in the NICU she had trouble with nipple flow, these were the only bottles that worked well for her. We've never had problems with gas or major spit-up because of them. My only complaint is really just a user error. There are times when if you don't get the bottom on tight with the plastic ring that goes in it to release air, it will leak out. However, if all parts are together, it works great. It is a pain to wash... with all the pieces and everything... because if you're not careful and don't remove each piece, you will get mold under that bottom platic piece. Even with those inconveniences, I still would use these bottles over any other. I've purchased 3-4 sets now. They are wonderful. We have to have the standard nipples like the ones shown. No other ones work for our daughter.
I expected the material to be thicker where you put your feet into it, but it does keep my feet warm when they are in there, and it makes sitting in my rocking chair more comfortable. it is also compact and easy to store under the rocker so it doesnt get in the way when not in use.
I thought this would keep my feet warm while nursing but when it arrived it felt cheap and it moved too much to be useful. Perhaps it works if you don't have a wood floor.
This stool is a great alternative to the wooden stool. My heels feels nice and supported on this cushy surface. The cover is easy to wash, and you don't have to worry about your toddler knocking their head (or any other body part) into it. You will be able to use it beyond your nursing time, and the foot slots are big enough for any size foot. I highly recommend it.
I had to stop using a previous nursing stool when my baby started to crawl and cruise. He often climbed up on it while playing and I was afraid he'd hurt himself on the sharp corners. This solves that problem! It is soft, perfectly angled for nursing, and the cozy place for your feet is an added bonus! I should have gotten this months ago!
Not great to lay your infant inside, but ok if you leave it closed and slide it under baby for extra support. You can't let go of your baby this way, but it works great when your baby has already fallen asleep and you need something to support their weight.If you are carrying your child on your hip, you could slip it under their heiny to support their weight.It's a quick fix for tired arms but, it doesn't free you up completely.
I was excited when my husband brought it home since I had read some good reviews, however after placing my son in it his chin was on his chest and not comfortable for him at all. Also the material was  in his face. I followed directions and thought I had it right, mabye they should send out someone to show me how it works. I gave it a 2 since it is stylish & I hope it works in a few weeks when my son can hold his head up and he can sit in it...we'll see. Wish I had saved my receipt!
I do not own this item but I tried it out in the store and it HURT my shoulder!!! The shoulder strap is too narrow, it digs in, and I only had it on for a couple seconds. I went with a New Native pouch and I LOVE it!!!!
I have three baby carriers. It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me. I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside. My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable.When he got older (5 mounths) we bought a backpack carrier. This is a really really a nice buy. We loved it and so did our son. The problem with it is that I wouldn't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside.So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier. I think that's the best for newborns because they don't have to support any body part. More over, when the baby sleeps, he is in a nice position and they seem to like it (even though I though his head was in a weird angle ?!?!) As soon as the baby gets heavier (8 or 9 lbs) it's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do. It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest (so when you have a large breast the baby's head is really really in a weird angle !). I think that it doesn't worth the price for the time you use it. Now that my younger son is 5 mounths, I don't use it anymore.
These items are awesome. The brush has soft bristles, both are brightly colored, cute design on both the brush and comb.
I love this set, and the kids love to look at one while I brush their hair with the other, super adorable.
My daughter loves to play with these, but the bristles are a bit hard. I like to use a little softer brush on her baby hair.  This would make a cute gift!
These spouts are great... they don't leak and they come apart for easy cleaning.They fit perfectly in Klean Kanteens, too!  Stainless steel is a great alternative to plastic cups for babies and children!  ;)
My 7 month old doesn't like the spouts, she just chews on them... maybe this will change as she gets older.
I tried a million different sippy cups, but my daughter just didn't take to the straw valve ones that were too difficult to suck from, or the freeflow BornFree that gave her more than she could handle.  The straw cups without valves worked ok for her, but sometimes she would suck up too much and it would go down the wrong pipe.These spouts were perfect for playful drinking, but she would not take large amounts.  Either way, I love that I extended the life of my Avent bottles (which I never used becuase they always seemed to leak) and no new bottles to get in the way.  Good value.
They advertise it, or it shows if you search for soft spout and they are hard. They are probably a good option to convert your bottles into sippy cups, but my son did not like them. I think also it does not help that they are green so he paid even more attention that they looked different.
Avent cups and spouts are my favorite. They are very easy to clean and they do not leak if you use them correctly (do not fill to much the cups and do not fill with sparkling beverages.
Love these cups and was pleased to be able to find replacement spouts. My toddler chewed through some of the white soft spouts, so I needed to find replacement spouts so I can use them to train my young baby to use the cup. The green "12 month" spouts are hard....they still gets scratched up from teeth and we often have to tell our oldest not to chew on the spout, BUT so far they are the best we've found. They really don't leak, and the spout has lasted longer than others. So -plan to replace soft spouts way more often, but the green ones hold up great for an older child. In fact, get away from the soft spouts and switch to the hard ones as soon as your child can use the hard spouts, because then you don't need to be so vigilent for tears which are a choking hazard.
We inherited the avent bottle from friends and this transition option is a great idea.  We started our son off with the soft spouts without the flange at 6mth.  He's just now accepting it (at 8mths) but when he did it was with the harder spouts and with the flange.  With future kids, I may skip the soft spouts, because he's not fooled that its a bottle, and go straight to the 'hard' spout.
The Design of these needs to be more natural or shorter, baby has to open his mouth really big to get this in.  He just looks at it and wants to play with the bottle instead of try to drink from it.  It's too "weird" looking I guess, he pushes it away every time I've tried it.  I also think it's too long for him to put his little mouth over on his own.  This is not a good trainer spout that's for sure, maybe for older kid, it's more like a wide straw then sippy spout.
I love the option of using the bottles I already have as sippy cups.
I do like these.  My son is still chewing too much for the green spouts--hello, toothmarks! so I got these.  I actually bought them to go in my Klean Kanteen sippy top, and of course they're perfect for that.  I haven't had a leak problem with these yet, and they're soft so they don't hurt DS's mouth if he whacks himself.
I had a couple Playtex Sippy Cups that were a few years old, and missing the valves to make them spill-proof. Found these online, ordered them, and sure enough they fit perfect and the sippy cups are good as new again!
playtex cups are the best ones on the market. everything they make is interchangeable which is very budget friendly. the valves tend to accidentally go into the garbage disposal or disappear in the dishwasher because they are clear. the replacement package is essential but are  not easy to find in stores.
One of my valves stopped working in my daughter's Playtex sippy cup and it was great to find these replacement valves at such a low cost so I didn't have to go out and buy a whole new cup.  They work just as well as the one that came with the sippy cup and I am happy with the purchase.
After many trials and errors with other sippy cups we came across the platex brand. They worked great! No spills, no leaking, and they didn't break when dropped. Problem is for some reason we were losing the valves as some point in the wash process. My hubbs was ready to toss the cups without the valves, but i insisted we had to be able to find the valves somewhere. Amazon of course! I bought some of these for replacements and as back ups. Super awesome saved us from wasting perfectly good cups!
When I found out I could just buy these valves, I was ecstatic! I didn't want to have to buy a whole new cup because we already had several, just missing pieces. (thanks to our garbage disposal!) These work wonderfully!!! I have never experienced any kind of leak or spill with these things. My son is extremely messy to say the least, but with these, I never have to worry!
Great to be able to purchase replacements. We are getting years of use between children with playtex sippy cups! They are by far our favorite kiddie cups!
These are exactly what I expected and fit into our playtex sipee cups.  They fit just right, allowing flow without leaking.
After looking at several different variations my husband and I decided to go with this one. The cushioning on the kneeler is awesome and I also really like the elbow rest.The hanging organizer has two pockets which fit our daughters bathwash and bubble bath. We use a new washcloth at each bathing so this is really all we need to hold.What I liked most about this product was that it "grows" with your child so they can use it as a stepstool as they get older. For the price I think its the best choice out there. Mom and dad can use it (we actually bought it for grandma who loves to bathe our daughter but has an ackward time doing it in our tub) and then our daughter can use it to brush her teeth or to stand in the kitchen.The maximum weight on this product is 200 pounds so I think its a good product for adults as well who maybe need a little extra help reaching that top shelf in the kitchen!
I really wanted to like this mat and elbow pad set. Unfortunately, we have a really deep tub, so the sides are tall and the cute little piece in between the elbow pad and mat isn't long enough. I use it, detached from the mat on the bottom because it does save my knees, but I can't use the net because now it is flimsy without the bottom attached and won't hold anything. So, if you have a deep tub, just get the bottom part, otherwise, it will just be a waste of money.
I registered for this thinking it would be great for bathing baby.  So far baby is really too little to bathe in the big tub (4 mos.) BUT, this item was absolutely indispensable when I was first home and recovering from my C-section!  Without it I wouldn't have been able to get in or out of bed, the car, or a chair.As far as the reviews about it being too tall or problems with older bathtubs, my tub is about 85 years old, and I wouldn't begin to be able to reach the floor of the tub without this.  Between getting high enough to reach over the side easily and getting a long enough reach to reach the floor of the tub, I have really needed the kneeler when I put baby's tub into the big tub.
this is so cool I like that it will be used for longer than just a kneeler for baby baths.... for the little one as a todler
The kneeling stool is great.  The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful!  BUT...the elbow pad is a joke!  There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic.  Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all.  It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it.  I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail.
My post baby weight was over 200lbs, if you are over 200 lbs, this is not for you.  I was only a few pounds over that so I thought "it will be safe". Err! Wrong answer, I cracked the kneeler portion.  What a blow to the postpartum ego.
We love our in sight video monitor! We use it at every nap and all night long. You turn off the monitor and just get sound if you want, but rather than geting up or opening our sons door at every peep I just check the monitor. The image and sound are crystal clear and we dont ever get interfearance. The best part is watching him play in the middle of the night or when he first wakes up and we're not in the room. I once went in to get his thumb out of his mouth since I saw him sucking on it clear as day on the monitor but when I went in his room, I couldnt even see his face, thats how clear the image is!As for a movement monitor, Its called angle care movement and breathing detector. We got one but never used it since he was in our room the first 3 months and now I can hear him breathing on the Sights and sounds monitor.
We have this monitor and I could not live without it. I cant imagine not being able to see my daughter at night if I hear her making noise. The camera works great and the picture is clear. I have noticed that if I move the camera to certain areas of the crib the reception will suffer so you have to get the camera in just the right spot. The handheld unit works great throughout the house (3600sqft)although it doesnt work if I go out in the driveway, I bought a cheap $20 one that takes care of that. This product has worked great for us!
I bought a different brand of monitor and never could get the picture to work so I exchanged it for this one.  The picture is pretty great I was impressed but I hear a roaring in the sound but it is not extremely bad or anything.  Overall, I am happy with this monitor and glad that I can see my son now without having to go into his room and wake him up to check on him.
It's great to watch my baby sleep...it keeps us from having to run and down the steps after every peep.  It allows us monitor his sleeping habits without having to stand over his bed.  We occasionally get some interference and would have to smack the monitor a few times to get our picture back.  The picture is pretty clear, even at night.  We love it and wouldn't use another monitor.
the head support doesnt fit to my car seat. my baby head is squeeze and i guess it only fit in the stroller. i like the touch of it but i have to return it .
I love the snuzzler. I put it in her car seat due to her little head always drooping to one side. Works great! Did not have any trouble with the straps fitting through it. There is no padding in the back of the snuzzler, just the sides which seems to make her feel secure. I would highly recommend this over any other infant support.
I bought this because it looked so cuddly and snuggly for my baby and because so many people had reviewed it as being helpful for keeping newborn heads where they should be in the carseat.  It is nice and soft and cuddly, and made of much nicer fabric than that ghastly polyester grayco liner, but I did not find it helpful and I did not find that it positioned my baby any better than she was in the carseat on her own.My main concern with this product is not that my baby will fly out of her carseat in a crash as warned by the 1-star reviews, my concern is that this did not prevent her head from flopping FORWARD -- infact, it was difficult for me to position the head pillow in a way that didn't make forward-flopping worse.  This chin-to-chest posture can restrict airflow.  Newborns can't necessarily protest or lift their heads to compensate when they're being deprived of oxygen.  I was warned about this at my baby-carrier group (before the sling recall, where some of the babies died for this exact reason) and it was something I worried about when my daughter was young because her head seemed to always fall forward in the carseat, even when it said it was well-positioned.I would not recommend this product to a new parent.  It looks really cozy, but it didn't stop my daughter's head from flopping in the direction I consider most dangerous, and it really only even fit around her in her carseat for a matter of weeks anyway.  I love other products from this company (like the swaddle-me!!!) but the snuzzler is just another piece of baby junk that I could have done without.
This item was very very handy for my little baby - she was only 6 lbs 14 oz at birth and grew slowly due to a heart condition.  I don't use this item in the car seat for safety reasons but ALWAYS use it in the stroller, bouncer, etc.  My daughter LOVES it!
I have liked this item and have used it in my jogging stroller to give my little one some extra support in the seat.  I have a Baby Jogger II and since it can be used until kiddos are 75 lbs she would have rattled around in there at 16 lbs when we first started using it.It's really soft and it has washed well - although you might want to wash & dry it by itself the first time because it had a lot of fuzzies.  It's nice that you can reverse it to have the soft fuzzy side out when it's cold and the smooth cotton side out when it's warm.I have to reemphasize what some of the reviews say - be careful when using anything extra in a car seat.  The reason is that, heaven forbid you were in a car crash, any extra padding could compress too much creating too much gap in the straps holding your little one in the seat.  I know that this says you can use in in a car seat, just make sure that any padding in a car seat is installed properly.  You don't want to have padding in between the seat back and the baby.
I have told every new mom I know this is a must have. This works so much better than the little head supports that come with the car seats and stroller. Our son was able to be all snuggled in and his head wouldnt flop around. He is still using this at 4mnths old. We tried taking it out for the summer but he just didnt seem as happy and comfy in his carseat.
I love this thing!!!!  My baby looks soooo comfy when she is in her carseat!!!  We stayed over my brother-in-laws house one night and had Lilly sleep in the carseat, and it was one of her best nights of sleep in her first month.  She was starting to outgrow it, but i still was using it, until the other day, I saw Lilly's new cousin Sarah slumped over in her carseat.  She looked so uncomfortable, that I'm letting her use the snuzzler now.  I think I might buy this for everyone when i go to baby showers now!!!!!!
What a great product and it really works!!  It doesn't take up space behind baby, it just takes up the space between the side of the car seat and the baby.  I don't know the mechanics of it but not once since we put this in the car seat has her head flopped.  We took it out to wash it, went out before it dried and it stayed home.  As soon as she fell asleep in the car without the Snuzzler- *flop*.  Btw it washed beautifully and still looks brand new.  The warm fuzzy side seems to keep her very cozy in our cold weather. As far as safety you can tell it doesn't add any bulk or come between the baby and the straps.I doubted the Snuzzler's claims, bought it, and LOVE it.  If I have more kids I'll consider it a necessity and if they could talk they'd probably say the same.
This is a must have for baby during the first 6-8 weeks. It provides much needed support in the car seat, bouncy chair, etc. It prevents them from slumping down and supports their little bodies. This is one of my top-5 items for a new baby.
This is very useful and it heats up bottles quickly and easily.  Like the other reviewers stated, it is quite convenient!  We take it when we travel and it is quite helpful since we do not have to leave our room in the middle of the night to warm a bottle.  The only small negative is that the cooler isn't attached and makes it harder to transport.
Personally I think bottle warmers are a waste of money.  If your baby is hungry they want to eat now and don't want to wait for a bottle to warm up in this thing.  It takes too long.  I got one for my shower and I'm so mad that I threw the box away because I wish I could return it.  I have always just warmed the bottle in the microwave. So many people are against that but as long as you shake up the bottle before you feed the baby there's no problem.  Only an idiot wouldn't check the temp before feeding their baby anyway.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST USE THE MICROWAVE.  It's so much faster!!
I really like this bottle warmer. It heats up the bottles well. It gets 4 stars because I think it takes way too long to heat up a bottle. My son screams waiting for the warmer to get done. I have also never used the cooler. In my opinion to me it's just as easy to grab a bottle out of the fridge. It is a nice warmer though and I would recommend it to others just as long as their baby is patient enough to wait the minute or mintue and a half that it takes to warm up the bottle.
We have used this warmer every day since our baby was a few weeks old and we love it. You do have to pay attention to the amount of water you put in so that the bottle does not get too hot, but after using it you get a "feel" for the timing and amount of water.The water measuring lines on the tubes that came with the warmer did rub off quickly.  However, I called the company and they sent new ones that have had no problems.This warmer has been a life saver.
This is a great item for nighttime feedings. No running downstairs to the kitchen for bottles. I put it on my nightstand so I don't even have to get out of bed to get a bottle. It holds 2 bottles. Because my son actually needs 3 bottles during the night, I use a insultated bottle tote to hold his bottles.
I got tired of getting up at night and going to the kitchen to warm up the bottle.  This is much better.  It takes a little bit of time to warm up, but does a good job.  You have to play with it to see how much water you need to get the bottle the right temp.  But once that is done it is great.  It makes a sizzling sound, but you get used to it and now my son waits for the bottle to warm up and looks at it eagerly, but doesn't cry.  It hold two bottles, but when I bought it my son just decided to drop the midnight feed so now I use it for the 5 a.m. feed only.  I have to use extra ice blocks to keep it cooler longer, but it does save me from getting out of bed since his crib is next to my bed.
I read reviews on the BRU website like a crazy woman before choosing products for my new baby. As a new mommy, this advice from other mothers who actually used the products was invaluable when deciding what to spend money on. I decided that I would follow the leader and add my reviews.  I couldn't wait to review this product!  It is my favorite!  As other reviewers mentioned, it is a life-saver! It makes middle-of-the-night feedings so easy!!  I have a two story home, and love that I don't have to go downtstairs to get a bottle or heat it!  The cooler holds two bottles, which is enough for us, as baby is eating every three hours. The really "wee hour" feedings can be covered without my having to go downstairs. How nice it is to walk into the nursery, take a bottle from the cooler, put it in the warmer, change baby and feed her...all in good time, without leaving upstairs!  I don't feel the need to move the warmer from the nursery during the day because I take baby there to change her before all her feedings anyway. I would never call this product silly or unecessary because I don't think getting a bottle to a nice room temperature instead of out-of-the-fridge-cold for my baby is being over the top! I make up all my bottles at once;  They're kept fresh and cold;  I heat them as I use them; It's a snap! I've had no long waits, no mess, no problems. I use Dr. Brown's bottles, and yes, you have to take the cap and nipple off, but I leave the tube in with NO PROBLEM. I have had to tweak the heating time a little for the short, four ounce Dr. Brown bottles, but again, NO PROBLEM! Seriously folks, this isn't rocket science!  Read the directions! With common sense and very little adjusting, this product is priceless!  I love it!
This has been one of the best gifts that we received for our son! Although we are breastfeeding, there are times when we bottle feed breastmilk. This item is a lifesaver. The directions are so easy and the unit has everything you need! We add two bottles to the cooler compartment and fill the water tubes before we go to sleep. Let me tell you that at 3:00 am, being able to just dump the water in the warmer and add the bottle is a real plus. Even with just the light of a nightligt, it is easy to use. This ease of use means that we can complete the feeding and get back to sleep in minimum time. I love the safety feature of the auto shut-off and you will be amazed at just how quickly it works. In addition, being able to use it for a variety of bottles, milk storage bags and even baby food jars makes it a product that grows with your baby.
I thought that I just had to have this bottle warmer. Boy was I wrong. I found this warmer to be more of a hasssle than anything. I used Avent bottle (which I love - no gas!!) so maybe the bottles are the problem - who knows. The bottles were either too hot or too cold. It is just as easy to install an instant hot water thingy on your faucet and make a warm bottle in seconds.
I simply love this machine! After you learn how to use the measuring and all that this machine saves me so much time and worry. Time over boiling water in a cup to let the bottle or baby food warm up in and worry over is it too hot or too cold still or is it warmed up evenly. With the night & day bottle & food warmer I don't have to worry about anything. If your looking for a bottle/food warmer buy this one!
Save your money and go to a local Walmart and get the bottle warmer by Parents choice. It allows the bottle to be stored on low for 8 hours and actually will boil water if need be!
Great product....it really simplifies and speeds up bottle preparation.  Even though we ended up rarely using bottles, I don't regret this purchase for the reason that it makes the times we DO use bottles much easier.  Cooler is convenient at night, and the warmer takes all guesswork and hassle out of preparing the bottle.  No complaints.
I got this because I knew eventually I'd have to warm bottles even though I am breastfeeding. I ended up having to use it sooner than I thought, and was so glad I had it on hand.A few times I was not able to produce enough milk so had to supplement with a few formula feedings. Also when my husband lets me sleep in on weekends, he feeds the baby either formula or some cooled breastmilk if it's available. Any time we have a sitter we make sure they use this as well.It is SO easy and SO great to use. Just pour whatever amount of water in it tells you, drop your bottle in and press the button. Within minutes you have a perfectly warmed bottle for your baby. No hot spots as microwaves produce and you can even warm baby food jars in this as well.Only a few times I had put too much water in and the bottle had to cool before I fed my son.It's so quick and is perfect for feedings that every mom should own one, even if you think you'll breastfeed exclusively. I know I thought I would, but not everything works out as you plan.
Had been searching for these everywhere, I have no clue why Playtex have moved away from these, I am guessing because of fear of allergic reactions but all my babies loved these over the silicone ones.  I have now been able to get the fast and slow of these and was able to find the orthodontic, which were the only ones my kids would accept when first going from breast to bottle, from eBay for around the same price I paid for these, Amazon did have them but at the time they were 3 times the price.  I do still have the silicone ones for when the baby gets older as they work better then but for the next few months, if I can ever get him to accept a bottle over the breast, then I will use these.
My son liked this until his preference for regular size nipple.  But while he couldn't tell the difference I did enjoy having couple of these nipples with the disposable pouch when traveling abroad.  It was a life saver.
A nipple our breastfed baby likes!  He is five months old and this is the only nipple he's ever tolerated.
I tried to switch my baby to fast from latex natural latch slow at 4 months, but he choked on the faster flow of milk. I thought he just wasn't ready, but the next day I caught my husband feeding him with a fast flow nipple and he was just fine! It turns out that they're not all calibrated the same way. I filled the two we had with water and held them upside down over the sink. One dripped at about 3-4 drops per second. The other dripped so quickly it was almost a steady stream (this is the one baby choked on before). So I learned my lesson - order some extra and check the actual flow using this test (fill w/water and hold upside down) as some flow MUCH faster than others!
I am very disappointed in this product. These nipples don't fit any of my Medela, Evenflo, Avent, or Similac bottles. Totally worthless purchase. After having ordered these, I found out that they cost less at Babies'r'us. I do not recommend this product.
When I went back to work after 5+ months of maternity leave, my baby had no interest in drinking from a bottle. The babysitter had to spoon feed milk to her. I tried almost every other bottle and nipple on the market except for the Adiri Breastbottle Nurser - Baby Bottle. The babysitter discovered that she preferred rubber nipples over silicon ones because they are softer, but she didn't like the shape of other brands, so it was still a struggle to try to get her to drink from a bottle during the day. I was so worried about my baby until I finally found thePlaytex Bottle 4-oz. Drop-Ins - 100-ct.. The nipple is very wide and shaped more naturally than other bottles. I replaced the silicon nipples that are included with the bottles with this rubber nipple and she finally drinks from the bottle and still breastfeeds whenever I am home. The drop-in bags turned out to be a great benefit of the bottles also. And because the bottle is lightweight and has a hollow bottom, my baby can easily hold the bottle to drink by herself.
I like the latex nipple because it is softer than the silicone ones and it is easier for my babies to get a good seal on them while eating.  They are so hard to find anymore though.  I have used them for 3 kids now and this last time about a third of the nipples we bought were defective, which was disappointing.The flow is between a slow and a medium in the Playtex silicone ones so the label of &#34;fast flow&#34; is a bit off.  However the flow has been just right for my babies so that is not an issue for me.Because of the nature of latex you do go through these faster than silicone ones.  We did replace them about every 3-4 months depending on how many we had in rotation.Because my babies could get a good seal on these and it prevented a lot of spilled and wasted milk they were worth getting and I will get them again. (hopefully, they solve the problem with so many defective ones though)
I used these with my now 3 year old b/g twins and my now 8 month old b/b twins. My boys still use these, though now we also mix in some other cheaper bottles and use these mainly for bedtime. They really were easier to clean, because food didnt get stuck on the bottom, and they really kept the gas at bay. My sons still nurse occasionally and get breastmilk, and they will take ANY bottle nipple, but for a while this was the ONLY one they would take, so I consider it their favorite. These bottles are really easy to use, and they are, in fact easier to clean! They fit in my Avent bottle sterilizer and they are a nice shape to get the milk easier. I recomend these for all new moms. Though there are many parts, they work MUCH better than the avents and live up to their word that they make gas much less frequent and a problem.
great bottles, no air at all! she only drinks from these bottles since she was 3 mos (she's now 11mos). Would definately recommend it!
My wife and I have been using the Avent bottles with our first child, and have been very happy with them.  These seemed to be along the same lines and cheaper, so we gave them a try.Overall, I would say that these are a great product for their price.  High quality, durable, and has a wide nipple so our daughter can go back and forth from bottle to breast.  Like the Avent bottles, they are easy to clean and there are not any thin tube/weird parts that are hard to clean and need to be replaced periodically (which is what drove me away from the Dr. Browns and Tommee Tippie bottles.)  They do have one more piece than the Avent bottles, but that's not too much of a big deal.  In my mind, the simpler the design is, the better.The things that I do not like as much are relatively minor.  First, the nipple has a softer ring section that seems to allow it to collapse in (not flat) if there is too much pressure in the bottle.  The second is that although the bottle does vent just like it aims to do, it seems that it takes more pressure in the bottle to cause it to vent compared to the Avent bottles.  This is only really a problem when the little one is getting lazy at the end of her bottle, and will just start to let go of the nipple causing it to vent through the nipple.  Third, now that the little one is starting to want to hold her bottle herself, she has a harder time holding these.  Over all, these are minor issues.They are less expensive, so I could see these being a good alternative for some parents.I would grab these in a pinch if there were no Avent bottles, but I'm sticking to the Avent.
we bought this for my daughter because we do a combination of breast feed and formula feed. This one is more natural to other bottles we have used before and also the ventaire technology is simple yet amazing. our daughter used to get a lot of gas with AVENT bottles but ever since we switched to these she did not have any problems. Also you dont have to burp her as much, very minimal amount of gas actually goes in while feeding.i recommend this product to every parents.
I have used Playtex bottles for all my children. Now on baby number three, I was excited to get the new and improved Playtex bottles. I love the wide because they are easier for my baby girl to grab hold of and learn to hold her own bottle.What I love about this new style is how very little to no air is sucked in. All my kids had problems with gas bubbles as babies and these bottle really helped stop this problem. This meant a better nights sleep for them and me.I also love that Playtex uses bottle liners. Easy cleaning, allows for breastfeeding moms to store milk and many other advantages you'll find as you use them.Highly recommend these bottle to everyone. Also a great gift for a new mommy to be.
These are very good bottles. I used them with my daughter because it keeps the air out of the bottles, so babies dont have upset tummies. My son is taking good to them, and they work very well in a bottle warmer.
I have been using Avent bottles for my previous two children and after they redesigned them with the insert I found I didn't care for them. I tried these out as an alternative with my third child and I love them. I had tried Playtex in the past but didn't care for the smaller nipple and found that if I wasn't really careful with sealing the bottle it would leak. I find that this new Advanced bottle has a wider nipple similar to the Avent bottle and that the pieces in the bottom fit better when closing, My baby hasn't had any colic issues with these and we were able to take her off Gripe Water and she still doesn't have issues with colic. Therefore, I believe these bottles are doing a great job with keeping the air from going through the nipple. They are easy to clean and store. I highly recommend these if you are looking for a wider nipple and something that is easy to clean but will still prevent airflow to your child.
For the most part I am very pleased with this product. It cut down on the gas problems my daughter had and really I had no trouble cleaning them. There was one bottle that for whatever reason leaked when I shook the bottle to mix it. Seeing that it was only one bottle out of the 6 that we have, I am not too bothered by it. Ultimately it's a fine product and I would recommend it.
So I don't normally review, however I really like this product and highly recommend it to all of my friends.  These bottles were originally recommended to me by a lactation consultant.  It was very important for me to breastfeed my baby and I was afraid of nipple confusion and/or baby preferring bottle and rejecting me.  Lactation Consultant recommended the slow flow nipple and said to never change them to faster ones.I work full time and it was important that my baby be fed the milk I pumped at work.  My baby never had problems going from using these bottles back to nursing.  These bottles are very easy to clean and very easy to use.  I had my set for 10 months now and they never leaked.  I read some of the reviews and those that complain about these bottles leaking probably tend to over tighten the caps.  My are in perfect working condition and I will be using and buying more if we have more kids.  Highly, highly recommended.
My favorite is the Playtex Drop-ins bottles, just because you don't have to wash bottles and can just throw in a new liner, but these are my second favorite. I bought the wide ones so I can easily switch the nipples to my drop-ins bottles. The only thing with these is one of them leaks a tiny bit. When I shake up the bottle to mix the formula, sometimes drips go flying. Other times they can be filled with water and in my diaper bag all day without a drop missing. I'd still recommend them.
With my first child I used the Playtex Drop-Ins, then switched to the standard VentAire once I got tired of buying more liners all the time. They worked great, so when purchasing bottles for our second child, I went ahead and purchased a full set of the VentAire Wide (6 of the 6oz and 4 of the 9oz) along with extra nipples and discs. This was apparently a mistake. Our new little one is 2 weeks old and I've had numerous issues with these bottles. Sometimes my little one will suck and suck and make no progress, other times the formula comes out so fast he chokes and gags on it. I frequently have to replace the top or bottom of the bottle to find a combination that works. I've even had the leak out the bottom a couple of times for no apparent reason. I always make sure the pieces are dry before assembling the bottle and that the bottom vents are free from obstruction. 2 weeks in and I'm already this frustrated, I can't imagine another year of this nonsense. I'm going out to purchase a couple of different bottles to see if we  can find one that works better for us.
Our baby was almost exclusively breast fed from the start.  We were not very diligent on giving her a bottle often so she probably got pretty attached to the breast.  She is now 12 weeks old and since I am going back to work this week, we started being more diligent 2 weeks ago with the bottle.  She took it without much problem and I'm confident it won't be an issue when I go back to work.The venting also seems to work as she doesn't swallow a lot of air - doesn't burp or get gas a lot.  I also like how the bottle comes apart so that you can clean it well.
I own 3 sets of these bottles, bought at 3 different times and three different places, and I haven't had a bit of trouble with any of them.  I started out using the Playtex disposables with the natural shape nipple while breastfeeding - and they were great - but when I started the transition to formula gas became more of an issue for my baby.  My best friend and my sister swore by these.  (They both hated the Avent ones.)  I bought these and I haven't looked back.When I bought the first set my baby was still using the slow flow nipples, so I got the 9 oz size, bought slower nipples and just switched them out.  Around 6 or 7 months I noticed that my baby seemed to be working too hard when taking her bottle.  I switched back to the stage 2 nipples.  My best friend had warned me that they took a little while for the baby to get used to, and she was right.  She was used to sucking really hard, and so the faster flow gagged her a little.  She dribbled a lot more out of her mouth, too.  After a week or so she learned to slow down.  She still dribbles a little at almost a year, but she's a baby.  She doesn't seem to mind, so why should I?  I have plenty of burp cloths to clean her up with!I have had a few leaks, BUT each time it was my fault.  Either I didn't take the time to make sure the disk was fully inserted into the rim, I didn't pull the nipple all the way through the nipple ring securely, or I didn't line up the threads of the nipple ring when I screwed it on so it wasn't on completely.  Sometimes you're just in a rush.  But, I have used these bottles all day, every day for at least 6 months now, and they are holding up beautifully.  I scrubbed and sterilized her bottles daily until she was 10 months old.  (Looking back, what was I thinking?  That was total overkill!!!)  Now I just rinse them and put them in the dishwasher.  The wide size cleans up easily no matter how you choose to clean them.After reading some other reviews, I guess I would be a little upset too if I bought a bunch of bottles only to find out they weren't right for me and my baby.  One of the best pieces of advice I got came from a salesperson at Babies 'R Us.  She said instead of buying a lot of bottles up front or a big starter pack, buy one or two of the individual ones in the brand(s) you want to try.  Then get one or two of the alternate nipples (if the bottle comes with silicone, buy one or two latex).  By doing this you have them on hand, so there is no middle of the night baby-won't-take-the-bottle trauma.  When the baby comes you can try out just one or two.  She said to still register for the big box, but just don't open it.  If they aren't what you or the baby likes you can return the starter pack and get the ones that work for you.  Smart cookie.  That's how I knew the Playtex bottles and nipples were the right ones for us.
We used the Starter set in the beginning to bottle feed our baby.  He's now 6-months old and drinks more than 6 oz at a time, we use upgraded our bottles to these 9 oz bottles.  Same great quality as the starter set.  I like how's it's BPA free, leak-proof, and easy to clean.  I also like how the bottle is curved so my baby can kind of hold the bottle on his own. He's barely starting to hold his own bottle, and the curve really helps.  Anyways, great brand.
I used VentAire bottles with my daughter 12 years ago and was excited to get a chance to try them again.  I am blown away at the product today.1. The bottom valve is easy to remove and clean and goes back together like a dream.2. When the baby drank, there were no bubbles at all around the mouth so I know the valve in the bottom was working as it is supposed to.3. The wide mouth style was super easy to clean.  Yes, there are some extra parts, but nothing like the Dr. Brown's bottles I used with my son.4. The baby easily took to the nipples.The only complaint I had was that all the bottles came with fast flow nipples.  If you're buying these for a small baby, you will likely need to replace them with slower flow nipples to start with.
These are the only bottles my 8 week old will drink from. Its not convinient to constantly breast-feed and these bottles are perfect. The nipple on this bottle is so "real" and is the only one my boy will use. My son did have gas problems, but after these bottles the problem fanished! I find them really easy to clean and I have used these bottles with my now 20 month old twin boys (just without the natural nipples) The bottom piece is a godsend since I dont have to SCRUB to get the gunk out of the bottle! These are truely great bottles, and they dont leak either!
I am a first time mother to twin sons ((now nearly 8 months old)) and I was unable to breastfeed for a few reasons, so I purchased a whole LOT of Avent bottles... HUGE MISTAKE!First let me tell you, NEVER buy a lot of one type of bottle before having your baby test them out! I sterlized all the avent bottles, wanting to be prepared when I needed them, and now I have a million of them around the house collecting dust because I cannot return them! For a few reasons the Avents did not work for us ((not just based on my boys preferances either, I all in all do NOT reccomend those bottles if you or your baby do not like the VentAires!)). I purchased these bottles and I LOVE them! My boys only take the natural nipple, and I have yet to see another bottle with a similar nipple shape. They do NOT leak if you put them together properly. First of all, you must make sure that the bottom of the bottle is secured TIGHTLY, and that the disk is put in correctly for you to get the advantages of the vent system. There is no "special trick" to getting the bottles to seal correctly so there aren't any leaks, which is how a bottle should be... you shouldn't have to line up arrows or wet the rim first, thats none-sense. The curve allows me to easily feed a baby ((or two!)) and the shape is great for the release of air to reduce gas problems ((which my boys have never had a huge problem with, and I thank the ventaire bottles!)) It is VERY easy to clean, I just rinse out the bottles in the sink ((just some warm water and soap)), and then I put the long bottle part on the highest rack of my dishwasher, and the rings, bases, nipples and disks go into the smaller baskets that I purchased for the dishwasher. I have NEVER had a problem with the dishwasher ruining nipples or disks, and so far no leaks ((although I do recommend changing nipples and disks every few months, they DO start to wear!)).There IS one thing I would like to add. One of my friends who has a daughter a bit older than my boys was at first dissapointed in the ventaires because they leaked in her diaper bag while traveling with them... We realized that this is because the bottle caps are NOT meant for preventing leaks while thrown into a diaper bag! They are for keeping the nipple sanitary on-the-go. Therefore when I need to bring bottles on a day trip, I put the right about of powdered formula into the bottles required, and carry around a large water bottle separately. When its feeding time I add water, shake, and have a ready-made bottle! If there is still liquid in the bottle, I cary it straight up in the stroller, or cap it with the solid caps ((sold separately... I found them at BRU)).All in all GREAT bottles, highly recommended!
I actually requested this product from the Vine program for a friend who just had a baby and she is pleased as punch with these bottles.  Now, the baby isn't talking but he isn't spitting up or crying uncontrollably with colic either.  Playtes is a trusted product and these bottles are nice and wide and help your baby go from breast to bottle with ease.  These would make a great shower gift as you get three neutral colored bottles and they are nine ounces which as all you good mommies know is the perfect size!
Bottle warmer fail. formula leaked from the bottom of the bottle where the vents are located. I hesitated but tried it in the warmer any way on the second use. First time I warmed the formula in a Dr. Brown bottle, this time I didn't want to create extra clean up work for myself. I ended up having to clean the bottle warmer, the counter top, the VentAire bottle and the feed to and finished Dr. Brown bottle.This is by far the worst venting system ever.
The vent in the bottom of the bottle makes it very easy for baby to extract milk. The flow is fast and furious which is good if your baby has trouble feeding from non-vented bottles. However, the high flow can overflow the capacity of my baby's mouth (&lt; 2mo old) which leads to messiness.Other drawbacks are that occasionally the vent holes leak. There are also many different parts that need to be disassembled for cleaning.I have both the "wide" and "standard" versions and there isn't any difference when it comes to feeding. The nipples are basically the same and my baby has no preference. I prefer the wide version because it is shorter (&lt;7") which makes it easier to fit into wall cabinets.As far as reducing gas, I haven't noticed any difference between these bottles andThe First Years Breastflow Bottlewhich I also use. I typically prefer The First Years bottle because of the slower flow. However, this may not be a problem once my baby gets bigger.Overall, this is a fine baby bottle despite the minor drawbacks.
I like these bottles, they are good for breast-fed babies. I have purchased the (fast) flowing nipples now since my son got tired of the slow ones that were helpful when he was 3 months old.
I love these bottles. My breastfed baby goes back and forth between the breast and the bottle so easily with these. They are super easy to clean because they come completely apart (the bottom comes off) and they don't leak. The shape is great for holding and the colors are nice and generic.Highly recommended!
I know they have a lot of parts and are kind of a pain to clean but my daughter loves them. We tried pretty much all other bottles. These really helped my daughter with colic along eith switching her to hypoallergenic formula. With the extra time and energy that goes into cleaning them they are really worth it.
I use these bottles and avent bottles (i have an avent pump)and noticed that with the avent bottles my milk had a horrible amount of bubbles.  These ones have NO BUBBLES!  which means its probably better feeling for baby! The size one flow is perfect for my son.  He burps as soon as you sit him up (this might just be because he is a fast burper?  every baby is different) and he has spit up only twice.  (He is one week old)The only problem I have is that I cannot find an adapter that will fit my avent pump and fit these bottles to pump directly into them which makes the avent bottles a little more convenient with breastmilk and playtex doesnt make a hand pump.When I decide to stop pumping I'll definitely give him these bottles exclusively.
My experience with these bottles was overall great. I like that the bottoms come off as well as the tops, this makes for easier cleaning. In my opinion, when it comes to bottles, many moms have their own idea of which type is best, i feel that this is a bottle worth consideration by the first time mom, as well as the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th time mom. It all boils down to personal preferences, and to what your baby likes best.However, I recommend buying ONE to begin with, then buying this set if you liked the one. i know this is hard to do, but it could save you some money. There were several different bottles i had received as gifts, that just didn't work for me, and they went wasted with no use from me. =/
This bottle works great with my Medela pump in style, using the Playtex Breast Milk Storage Kit. I like that this bottle can use the same nipple as the Dropins. Our daughter has never had any issues transitioning between breast and bottle. Playtex offers a variety of nipple (slow,medium,fast,variable,&cereal;) flows so it is easy to find a nipple flow that matches your flow :), also a very important factor when switching. My daughter has never had any problems with spit up or cholic so I all I can say is that these bottles didn't create any problems.Pros to using the VENATIRE WIDE/NATURAL SHAPE is that they're reusuable so no additional cost like the dropins. They're really easy to clean since they come apart, and the parts are easy to clean. You don't have to use the bottle rings that come with the kit, as they fit right on the adapter. Just remove the bottle from the adapter ring after pumping, put the sealing disc on, and store until feeding. I've found that the storage kits (deluxe kit and the ones in the permium nurser gift set) including sealing discs that are the flimsy silicone pieces that fit into the nipple ring work better with the Ventaires than the sealing discs in this kit. We've had a few leak from the top when mixing (we have to add some prune juice for our daughter) a bottle with the hard top sealing disc. We store these bottles on their bottom in the fridge, and have never had a problem with leaks. So really, I would recommend looking for the deluxe/premium storage kit.When you're ready for the bottle just warm up some water in the microwave, and then plop the bottle into the water. It only takes a few minutes since, and whalaa (NO NEED FOR A BOTTLE WARMER! We warm Dropins this way too, it's a little faster since the liners are thinner).When the bottle is warm remove the sealing disc, & the insert the nipple.I have never tried freezing milk in the bottles although I know that the storage kit is advertized to be able too. If I have extra milk I just freeze it in an ice cube tray, and store in Ziploc freezer bags. This system has turned out great for if lil' one finishes her bottle and is still hungry but doesn't need another entire feeding, just put a cube or two in...no wasted milk!OVERALL, THIS BOTTLE IS A GREAT CHOICE FOR THE BREASTFEEDING MOM WHO CAN'T BE READILY AVAILABLE 24/7 :)
My three month old daughter is breastfed and we thought we'd give these bottles a go. I was hopeful that she might like the VentAire bottles, but they were a fail. We tried both the slow and fast flow nipples  in these bottles and she wasn't able to get anything out of the bottle with either flow rate.  It was disappointing to say the least.Even though the bottles didn't work for us, I'm sure they probably work well for someone's baby, so I will try to give you a run down on the bottles contained in this set.  The set contains three nine ounce bottles with the fast flow nipple.  There are no additional replacement valves for the vent with the set as there are in the newborn starter set.Other reviewers have stated that they had leaking issues with these bottles.  In the few times that we attempted to use these bottles we didn't have any leaking issues, but I'm sure they could happen given that the bottom screws on and has holes in it that are covered with the silicone valve vent.The bottles feel pretty comfortable in your hand.  I have used bottles in the past that are not comfortable to hold, so I think it's worth mentioning that it fits nicely in your hand.When it comes to cleaning these bottles you can be sure you have every nook and cranny clean since it fully disassembles, but that also means that you have lots of pieces to keep tabs on.  The bottle has six parts total.Overall, while the bottles look nice, I think the Ventaire concept is really a gimmack and a poorly executed one at that.  What good is a bottle if it's nearly impossible to get anything to come out of it?  Personally, I'd pass on these bottles and try either the Avent bottles or the Playtex Drop Ins.
I like the VentAire bottles, they are easier for my baby to hold while eating, and do seem to reduce gas. The only downsides- the neck opening is a little small, it makes it more difficult to scoop formula into the bottle, and sometimes the nipple will collapse. Those are small problems though, i would still recommend using these bottles, my son loves drinking from them.
These bottles are perfect. I love the shape of them because they are easy to hold. This shape is also designed to help prevent ear infections according to the manufacturer. These are pretty pastel colors and are easy to clean. A must have for your baby! We like the fact that there is not so much air getting into the baby's tummy.
These were SUCH a pain to clean and use - my kitchen looked like a science lab.  I threw them all out.
This bottle design was great for my little one.  We had been using shorter, fatter bottles and it was frustrating to my daughter since she really wanted to hold it on her own, but she had difficulty with the bottle design.  With these bottles, she was able to hold it up pretty well rather quickly.  The bottles are easy to clean and sanitize.  For my little one the fast-flow nipples were a little fast, but I was able to get slow-flow nipples for the bottles and it worked perfectly.
I'm happy with these bottles so far though they are a bit slow with feeding.  The multiple parts (5) make it easy to get these bottles clean.  My baby took to it easily and he's both a bottle fed and breast fed baby.
We tried several different types of bottles. I prefer these hands down. Our baby actually burps less using these than with breastfeeding. There are multiple parts to wash but since they work so well I don't mind it at all.
This Playtex 3 pack BPA Free VentAire 9 Ounce Wide Bottles are for my grandson and according to my daughter are perfect for him.
I bought one of these bottles because i likes the idea of being more like the breast, and i wanted to breast feed.  I couldnt breastfeed but my son only really likes "dome" type nipples.  I tried giving him this bottle and he couldnt get anything out of it! He was just sucking air.  I looked at the ammount in the bottle after a few minutes and he hadnt gotten anything.  I tried twisting the top of the nipple to "open" the hole and tried again.  he still had the same problem!  I use the normal ventaire ones and he love them and has no problem!
Ordered these bottles and am very happy with my purchase. They ar BPA Free and today that is a biggie. Will definately buy again.
We used these several years ago with our breatfed son and hated them.  These are a vast improvement over the previous design!  The disc in the bottom is bigger - it's not a small little flap that can get lost in the dishwasher or even the countertop.  It's a bigger silicone ring, much like the nipple, but the center isn't solid so that the bottom of the bottle can 'breathe' and let air in.  The other advantage is that the bottom silicone ring screws in and fits very well into the bottom ring so it's hard not to get a good seal and create a leak.  I tried these with our daughter who is honestly too old for a bottle just to see what she would say.  She CHUGS.  Not once did she have to stop out of frustration with the flow or to let air in.  I never saw bubbles in the water, either.  With the old design, sometimes you still had to take the bottle from the baby to let the air catch up.  The bent shape is perfect - not too much, not too little.  It's wide, so younger babies may have problems holding it on their own initially, but for me, that didn't detract from their overall use or awesomeness.From a breastfed-baby standpoint, these are probably not the best idea because, if you hold the bottle upside down, or tilted at an angle similar to what you would for a feeding, the fluid just drips out.  They require very little, if any, actual suction to remove the fluid from the bottle, so it's easy for baby to be lazy with the bottle, and consequently, to want to be a lazy nurser.  While the baby has to work a bit to have an active flow, if baby is sleepy, there will be breastmilk/formula dripping whether baby is sucking or not.I like these better than the Dr. Brown's version because there are fewer parts and the nipples seem to be more than moms' in design.  Babies will certainly voice their opinions, but if you're in need of something that helps eliminate air and potential gas, these may be a good choice.
Scientific ingenuity at it's best. I love that Playtex always seems to put it's best foot forward when it comes to the health and comfort of our little ones. Thanks Playtex.
This has a few 'moving parts' but easily assembled and washed.  It does seem to reduce the baby's gas problems.  Be aware the playtex nipples come in slow flow and fast flow.  They interchange with the the nipples on the playtex drop in bag system, too.  The best feature is the size, as you can get 7 ounces in it, but is short and squat and easier for the baby to hold onto.
These bottles are the best I have used. They come in attractive colors, but most importantly, they are great for semi-upright feeding. The angle of the bottle body actually does help reduce gas and spitups in my baby as claimed by the company. I used AVENT bottles before and they were horrible with leaking, but the Playtex Ventaire bottles solve that problem. These bottles are great for storing breastmilk or formula for quick feedings and the nipple shape is "natural" meaning it's more like the shape of a real nipple. I've found this has helped my baby as we switch between breast and bottle feeding. The caps for the bottles snap on really well and prevent spills if the bottle gets tipped over.Although there are several parts to be cleaned after each use (the nipple, cap, vent disk, bottle body) all of the parts are easy to clean and can be sterilized safely using a microwave sterilizer. I will never use any other bottle but these again!
When a couple has a baby, it opens up a whole new range of possibilities and choices, the vast majority of them on uncharted territory. When it comes to feeding the little guy and a bottle is needed, my niece had gas trouble with the original nipple for the bottle. But since she got these, the baby is less gaseous, happier, and that means his parents sleep a little better at night. This now is her preferred brand, thanks to the Vine program.
I tried some of the originals of this product when they hit the market.  We had a very colicky baby and tried anything we could to help her.  Including these overpriced bottles.The good:The do drastically reduce gas compared to standard bottles.They are easy to sanitize since they can be disassembled.They come in really pretty colors.The newer models seem to have better rubber rings that the first design.The bad:There are other bottles that do a better job of reducing gas.They are a PAIN IN THE BUTT to clean. Must be completely disassembled.If you don't fit the rubber rings in to perfection, they leak.They don't always leak right away, so if you prep a bottle ahead of time, you may find it in the fridge seeping out everywhere.The rings break down after continued use and you will have to replace them.Replacement rings are so hard to find and expensive that you're better off buying new bottles.The don't fit in any standard bottle holder because of their strange shape.They are incompatible with bottle warmers.I will continue to use these because my baby is almost off of bottles and they were really pricey to acquire, but I wouldn't endorse them highly.
These are a nice shower gift because just about every new mom gets newborn-size breastfeeding bottles, but these are a great transition item (kind of like giving a new mom a size 6 months onesie, so she has more than just the first month covered).  It's a nice touch that they are BPA free.
These bottles were a gift at our baby shower.  I am glad I didn't spend the money on them because the instructions warn not to use them in an electric bottle warmer.  We all know you aren't supposed to microwave bottles either, so you are left with the only other option, placing the bottle in boiling water to warm.  That works fine except when you tip the bottle up to feed the baby, the boiling hot water that has been trapped in the vent holes drips down your hand/arm, and potentially onto the baby!  Now I have to remember every time to make sure I get a towel and shake the bottle a little to make sure all the vent holes are emptied out before feeding our baby.  USE CAUTION
The only word that comes to mind to describe this bottle is garbage!  It leaks and is cheaply made.  I'm a nurse and used to working with all types of equipment and I know junk when I see it.  All babies get gas, all babies need to burp.  The bottom line is the basic 99 cent bottle at your local supermarket will do the job!
After quite a few issues breastfeeding I went to multiple support group sessions in my county, all the lactation consultants recommended this bottle especially if you have to supplement or have other issues.My daughter at 4 months goes back and forth beautifully (great for a working mom!)A bit frustrating that my pump is not compatible (Avent) so I have storage bottles and feeding bottles and somehow I managed to get two systems with lots of little parts but my girl is happy and healthy so it's all worth it!
I primarily breastfeed my kiddos, but I like to keep a few bottles on hand to help when I'm not around. These have been some of my favorite bottles that I've used with my son. There are several little pieces that are part of these bottles, but they seem to do a good job of limiting gas, etc. You do want to make sure that you've got all of the pieces attached correctly or they will leak. I like that they are dishwasher safe and the 3 pack is a convenient size.
I ordered these bottles because they claim to alleviate gaseiness, my 3 month old had horrible gas issues. i used these bottles for over a month, and her gaseiness was gone.
Mom loved these but with other more high-tech bottles, it takes a while to get into "the zone." The right nipple, the right angle and right delivery all play into the success of the bottle. Following the directions is important and it takes a little practice. She said it was a little frustrating at first but once both mom and baby got it figured out, feedings went well.
I love these bottels.  After using glass bottles with a standard nipple for a few weeks, my baby decided that the nipple was to small.  These wide bottles are perfect for him as I am still nursing him while he is not at daycare.  Makes it easy for him to go from bottle to breast with no problems.  The angled bottle makes it easy to feed letting in no air. I have never had a problem with leaking, those that do might not tighten the parts enough.  There are about 5 parts total to the bottle, but it is very easy to take apart and clean with no special tool needed. I only give 4 stars because they don't sell the the little vent disk that goes in the bottom of the bottle seperatly.  It does come with two extra disks, but might be helpful to also sell extra disks at the store.  Highly recommended!
I used these for literally a few days after my son was born. Then I switched back to the bottles my daughter had used a couple years prior. I'm glad I saved those because I couldn't stand these. They leaked everywhere, the nipples were flimsy and my son had the hardest time trying to get anything out of them. I had to switch him to the larger stage and STILL he had problems. Playtex makes decent sippy cups but their bottles are useless.
Just what this type a mom needed to organize the closet. Love that it comes in two colors, multiple sizes prepared,  and that you have a decent quantity included
These have been really fantastic. I can easily look in baby's closet and see how much and what types of clothes I have for each age group. You often think you have more than enough clothes but then realize you only have snow suits and long sleeve onesies for your 6 month only in July. I can easily plan ahead and get the right clothes on sale instead of having to go grab full price clothes at the last minute because baby is overheating in the summer.
A friend recommended I get this and I am really glad she did.  I kept all my baby's clothes organized and also helped me see what he need/had not worn yet.  I received tons of clothes at my shower and these really did help me organize all of it before my baby came and organization was out of the question.
This product has helped me keep my son's closet organized as he grows.  Now I can keep different sizes in the closet while staying organized.
I feel like my babies closet is a rack in a department store. Very cute and organized according to size.
This is a must have for all new, and really any mom! Keeps my daughters closet organized. We received SO many clothes it was hard to see which ones I had to use before she grew out of that size. Glad I got these with my first baby, because I will definitely be re-using for the next one. The sizes go up to 2T and beyond! I placed NB, 3mth, etc stickers on one size, and then larger sizes stickers on back of NB hanger (once NB clothing retires, flip around to use as an 18month marker)
This is a great product to help keep your baby's closet organized, newborn to 12 months old.Now if only the different baby clothes brands could sync up their sizes!!!! Our 8 month daughter can wear various clothing pieces from "Size 3 Mos" up to "Size 12 mos" depending on the brand/material/etc. Even when you organize your closet using these spacers, when you eventually do come to that "bigger size" you may find it won't fit your baby because of different brand measurements!My tip would be to correlate these hangers to your baby's age, not the size on the clothing tag. Then once every few weeks go through your closet (ALL clothes) and see how each item would fit your baby and arrange accordingly.
Got exactly what I wanted in this product. Very easy to use, divides things nicely, and is a good quality product.
After my baby shower, I received so many baby clothes of different sizes. These organizers made my job easier with hanging and finding baby clothes at the correct size.
Simple....effective...nothing fancy...works fine for me! I will be using these until my son is two and then I'll have to buy some more!
It is it is. Nothing special about the dividers, but they do their job.i don't use the stickers on them so that I can reuse as the sizes get larger.
These look great in the closet and do what they do: organize clothing by size. Not essential, but I'm happy I bought them!
These work pretty well in my son's closet!  I love that it pops up on top of the rod so I can see what it says.  I'm disappointed that the stickers that come with it are &#34;3 months&#34; &#34;6 months&#34; etc. rather than &#34;0-3 months&#34; and &#34;3-6 months.&#34;  Many clothes are like this these days as well and it's not very helpful for us.  They tend to not slide very well on our older, metal rods (they are also thicker than most newer rods) but I'm positive this would not be a problem on a plastic tension rod or something of the sort--just gets stuck on the metal I think!
I purchased the Baby Buddy Size-It Closet Organizers in Royal Blue.1. Color - the color is rich and very noticeable hanging in the closet.2. Compatability - Easily slips over the metal hanging rod of our closet, but is made to fit even the higher quality wooden dowel-type closet rods.3. Functionality - Though set comes with five organizers, stickers are included up unto size 8 for children's clothes.  This ensures that these organizers will be useful for many years, as once child outgrows a certain size, that organizer can be recycled into the next size up.4. Quality - Plastic is bendable to get over a clothes dowel, but not to the point of creating weakness in the plastic or breaking.  Obviously, it will break if abused, but product has enough give to be put on and taken off dowel repeatedly.I have been given a ton of baby clothes for my baby girl and this tool is a great way to organize all the cute outfits by size so that she does not grow out of a size before she can wear the outfit.  They are big enough to be noticeable up above the clothes but not too big as to interfere with the shelf above the hanging clothes rack. I highly recommend this product to any expectant parent who enjoys having everything organized!
I got these after we announced we were pregnant to help keep track of all of those awesome gifted baby clothes.  It was super easy to see what we had, and as folks asked what we needed, I was able to say &#34;more 6 months clothes&#34;.  They're great!
Great deal! My son keeps accidentally throwing his spoons away with his yogurt, so these are replacements and I am glad to not have to invest too much for them!
These are wonderful baby spoons. Just the right size for littlest mouths. I wash them in the dishwasher without issues.  We keep them for a year or longer.
i have these for my diaper bag and sometimes i toss them, but sometimes i mix them up with the other spoons and put them in the dishwasher. they have never melted and are sturdy enough to reuse.
These are a must have, used with both my children. Dishwasher safe but also don't feel bad about throwing them away is the end up in some far corner of the couch.
They can be washed over and over in the dishwasher and at the same time, can be thrown away without guilt when out and about as they are so cheap.
Great deal. I have twin babies and needed a lot of spoons that were small enough for little mouths., price was great.The handle is not too deep so they do fit in the funny little slots of my silverware holder in the dishwasher. So all in all just right .
These are great spoons! I would not throw them away if I don't have to.  They were super affordable and they are a great sized spoon fir my 5mo olds mouth.  They are small and wash wonderfully, and they fit in our bag to bring around with us.  They washed really well in the dishwasher because they are thicker and sturdier.  I was worried they would melt, but they did great!  These are a huge bargain and i was very impressed!
Love these spoons- lots to have and toss in the lunch box for the day.  Don't have to worry about washing every day, can just throw in the dishwasher and then there are plenty in the reserve to use.
I bought these spoons for our first family vacation with a 9 month old. We were gone 5 days which included a 12 hour drive there and back. These spoons were great!! The size was perfect, they were sturdy and not flimsy or cheap like an adult disposable spoon. And the price was great to be able to feed him either in the car or at a restaurant and just throw away the spoon and not worry about washing/rinsing them and re-packing them. I will definitely purchase these for any future vacations and will even keep spares in my diaper bag in case I forget to pack his normal spoons.
A great value. I bought one set and it's lasted me over 6 months. My baby girl had no issues with these
I don't know why they call these &#34;take and toss&#34;, because I bought a pack and I've been using them ever since. We just wash them in warm, soapy water and use them over and over again. Since we don't have a dishwasher, it's awesome to have a huge supply of baby spoons in case we don't get around to washing all the dishes right away. These spoons are incredibly easy to clean (NOTHING sticks to them!), comfortable, and gentle on babies' sensitive gums (though they are plastic, not the rubber-tipped kind). We love these, and they're a great way to save money!
Nice and shallow, easy to use, plus easy for my daughter to hold.  You get so many for a great price and they're not cheap either.  Plus, like everyone else is saying - no need to toss, they can easily be washed over and over again.
These spoons are great, I keep a few in a diaper bag, a few at grandmas - etc. I give one to my son as I feed him. Its a great set.
I bought these since my son has just turned four months old. I was surprised when some said they used them as disposable baby spoons. The plastic used to make them is pretty sturdy so I would definitely re-use them. And since it's a 16-pack they will last me for a long while. Not to mention it's a great deal :DNeedless to say, I would absolutely recommend this product to any parent.
The fact that these spoons are inexpensive make them perfect for daycare.  The tips are soft and rounded, and gentle on baby's gums.  My only complaint is the handles are a little shorter than I would perfer, but still perfectly functional.
I bought this mirror because it was far larger than the adjustable suction-cup mirror I had on the rear windshield of my car. I discovered negative #1 in the store: it uses a giant safety pin (as well as a strap) to attach to the seatback. My car has a leather interior, and the last thing I wanted to do was poke holes in the leather! I tried just using the strap, but that is supposed to go around the headrest, and there is no headrest for the center of the backseat, just the right and left sides. Since the safest place for a baby is in the headrest-less center, the strap was out. There was also a velcro tape that we could use to stick the mirror onto the seatback. The negatives there were a) sticky glue residue on the leather and b) when we need to fold down the rear seat for transporting bikes or something equally large, the rear seat would fold precisely right down where the mirror would be, so we'd be constantly removing it and the velcro tape and then reattaching it. Highly impractical for any vehicle with a leather interior or with a rear seat that folds down in the middle. I suppose it's okay for a fabric-covered seat or for  a small car that doesn't have fold-down rear seats, but for an SUV or minivan it's really not usable.
I purchased this mirror because it looked like a great way to keep an eye on the kids while on the road... well, it's a great size, it's very clear, and I love the pattern on it... but it won't stay put!!  I am constantly adjusting this mirror!  This is a hastle because you have to adjust it, then get into the drivers seat and check it and re-adjust if necessary and when you go to look back at the kids and it's not in the right spot it can be frustrating!  However, I have adjusted mine to where I want it (hooked to the top teather) and velcroed it in place... it seems to stay pretty much where I need it now.  I gave it four stars because it does the job (now!), but I would definately look into other options as well!
I bought this mirror when our daughter was a few weeks old and I don't see how I lived without it when I had my first two boys.  It is great!  I had a little trouble getting the mirror to attach correctly but once I got it to stay, it is a lifesaver!  It is worth every penny!
I used it for a few days  and I felt very safe but as soon as I washed the stove the 3m stickies came off. I was very disappointed. Thinking of getting more stickies to try it out again.
I'm confused by all the bad reviews as the tape on this product stuck to the surface of our stainless steel stovetop for over 5 years before I removed it with a razor blade! I'm here again to buy a new one because we have a new toddler in the house who nearly grab a pan yesterday (super scary moment there!)! I do recommend this product! I do plan to use some rubbing alcohol to clean the stovetop edge where I plan to put the tape. Maybe that's what did it last time (?)
This lock installed in ten seconds and sticks in place no problem. Easy to open and quick to snap right back into the locked position. Baby can't open the over door at all. Great purchase, would recommend to anyone with kids.  Sidenote: Amazon prompted the rating of the educational value and 'fun' value of this item and would not allow the review without it. Clearly it is not a toy, nor is there educational value.
These converters worked perfectly with my Medela Swing Breast Pump and my Medela Pump in Style.  I loved not having to transfer milk from one bottle to another.
Now I can pump right into my bottles with my Medela pump. You do need the adapter rings that come with the bottles though. Wish I would have realized that the first time because I leaked. But with the rings, they work perfectly.
I love this product! It really cuts down on the amount of time it takes to make my baby's bottles now because I can pump directly into her bottles. It also cuts down on the wasted breast milk since I pump right into what she feeds from. I use this with the Medela Pump In Style Advance. Make sure when you buy this product it comes with two of each of the adapter rings. The old conversion set only came with one of each since ring. This has two for the bottles and two for the Via nursers. Love it!
I use this to pump with myPump In Style Advanced Breast Pump Backpackand pump directly into my AVENT bottles. So glad I got this because I was sick of pumping into the medela bottles came with my pump & then transferring the milk into the AVENT bottles so giving me extra bottles to wash all the time! Just make sure you still use the ring to seal the converter to your bottle or you will spill your milk everywhere! I learned that the hard way!
i use this with my medela to pump directly into the avent bottles.  as another reviewer has mentioned, the nipples on the medela bottle tend to collapse.  i definitely recommend getting some extraPhilips AVENT Adaptor Bottle Rings(to prevents leaks) - they're small and easy to lose.
it does the job that i wanted it to do...which is to fit a medela pump and pump directly into an avent bottle.  however, i noticed that milk leaks to the outside of the bottle while pumping.  this has happened quite a few times, which is very disappointing.  i finally figured out that you need to use the inner rubber ring with the converter.  in retrospect, i missed something that was pretty obvious, but i wish there were some instructions that specified this.
Glad I got this, made it possible to pump directly into my Avent bottles rather than the smaller ones that came with the pump.
This is an excellent accessory to get along with any Avent breast pump and/or Avent bottles.  You don't have to worry about transferring milk and risk spilling it.  These seal well.  Save time and trouble!
I used these to pump into Avent bottles with my Medela pump. I use the &#34;smaller&#34; sized adapter. I've used it with the Medela personal double electric and the manual Harmony. I haven't had any issues with leaking. We ended up not using Avent bottles, but I still use these with an Avent bottle set to pump and transport milk between work and home.
Wow! I can't believe it took me 2 months to find there but I'm so glad that I did. I am an exclusive pumper so my breast pump and I have become best friends since the birth of my son. I used to pump into the Medela bottles that came with my pump then dump into my Avent bottles. However my son takes 6 oz bottles and sometimes each one of my breasts will produce up to 10 oz.  So before these converters I had to stop pumping, dump out, blah blah blah it took forever and I always spilled at least a little bit and it interrupted my flow of milk. Now that I can pump directly into the bottles I am getting significantly more milk in less time. Also I have a ton less dishes to was and store since I have eliminated the Medela storage bottles. These are a must buy!
Okay, so you're probably wondering why I'm so excited about a simple product like this, huh?  The answer is simple - this is a great, almost mandatory, accessory for breast pumping.  Our children are and have always been fed with exclusively breast milk.  During those feedings when my wife can't feed them directly, she pumps and we feed them refrigerated (or frozen) milk.  The little 4-oz bottles that originally came with the pump worked great at first - but our twins are growing fast, and now regularly eat more than 4 ounces per feeding.That left us with two options: my wife could start taking a large cooler with her so that she could pump into more than one bottle per side each session (which would be a long, inconvenient, and somewhat messy process to change bottles mid-pumping) or to pump into larger bottles.  Using these adapters, she can pump right into the bottles that we use for feeding - saving transfer steps in many cases, and the size of the container can grow with our kids.  We think these are great - and would be a great value at several times the price!
Honestly, I love my AVENT bottles, however I DID NOT LOVE MY AVENT PUMP! After returning my AVENT pump and realizing that I would have to go with a different brand I immediately bought these.  I rented the Medela hospital pump and these worked perfectly.  Much better than having to buy additional bottles just for pumping.  I only used these with the hospital pump so I don't know how well they work with other brands.  These are also dishwasher safe, which I completely appreciate.  When I bought these, it came with four (4) &#34;rings&#34; - 2 for regular AVENT bottles and 2 (I think) for the wide, breast milk storage bottles.  As other reviews have mentioned, there was no instruction manual, but really you just screw on the top of the AVENT bottle and screw into the bottom of the pump system - very easy.  I would completely recommend these if you plan on using AVENT bottles without the AVENT pump.
The box specifically states the brands of pumps it supposedly fits, but I could not get the threading to fit on my Lansinoh pump.
I purchased these so that I could pump directly from a Medea pump to my avent bottles and it works perfectly.
I am an exclusive pumper, going on two months now, and have an oversupply "problem." I pump with a hands-free bra on the way to/from work. After overflowing one of the ameda bottles in a very messy drive home, I decided I needed to pump into bigger bottles. I feed my daughter with Avent bottles and these have allowed me to pump directly into a 9oz bottle for feedings. They are great!I highly recommend them to all pumping mothers!
I think I'd been pumping for 6 months before I found these, which meant I was washing more pump bottles and pump parts every single day.  It was so nice to get these and be able to pump directly into my son's bottles as opposed to the pump bottles that would then have to be poured into his bottles.  Less to clean up and less chance for spills.
I love being able to pump directly into bottles instead of having to transfer and dirty more bottles/containers than already necessary. These work great and screw onto both the pump (I use an Ameda Purely Yours) and bottles easily!
So glad I stumbled upon this product! Now I can pump from my pump right into my avent bottles! Saves so much time between transferring to the bottles from the ones that come with the bottle and on cleaning time because there's less to clean. Less effort on my part means a happy mom and a happy baby! They should advertise this product better! I wish I had these with my first.
These converters work well with the Avent standard 4oz bottles that I was given. I love it that they allow me to pump directly into the bottle, however, you have to be careful, because the milk can leak out of the side of the converter. You need to make sure that you also buy covers for storage purposes because even if you try to use the lids that come with the bottles, you will still get some leakage.
They work like they're supposed to, though they add a little bulk to the whole process.They are easy to clean and they make most of my bottles and pumps compatible with each other now.
You would figure that using this kit is a no brainer, screw it in and pump right? There are no instructions that come with the set. Although I guess common sense should have told me to use the ring with the system, I didn't. The first time I pumped the bottle leaked on me. So I learned... use the ring! I am not lowering my rating based on this since it is my error for not using the ring.I also have found that I can pump directly into different brands of storage bags using this connector when I used my Medela pump with the very old Avent Naturally drop-in liner bottles (no longer sold but I occasionally see it on ebay). The drop-in liner bottles I have were given to me by someone who bought them ten years ago. These are the drop in bottles that came before the Avent Tempo Drop in bottles. I do not know if you could pump directly into the Avent Tempo with any type bags as I have not tried it. But with the original Avent Naturally drop in bottles, I can insert any brand storage bag with the zipper below the screw in part, attach the pump connector to secure the bag, and pump directly into a storage bag. This way I don't have to transfer from bottle to bag.Based on the product pictures and product description, I could not figure out a couple things:1. How many conversion connectors came with this set?This package comes with four connectors, 2 for the regular Avent bottles and 2 to fit the VIA storage system.2. Which pumps does the conversion kit work with? (these are the pumps as listed on the box)Medela pumpsEvenflo Comfort SelectAmeda Purely YoursLansinoh Double ElectricPlaytex EmbraceDr. Brown's Natural Flow Electric/ManualUPDATE: 01 April 2012I have been using the adapters for a couple weeks now and have had no leaks when using the ring. In the mornings I will pump directly into the avent bottles withPhilips AVENT BPA-Free Classic Bottle Sealing Discsin place to store in the fridge. That way, my mom can just attach the nipple to the bottles. No more transferring from the Medela bottles (with the awful nipples that collapse due to the vacuum created when the baby drinks).As for pumping directly into storage bags, I have used the Nuk, Medela, and Lansinoh bags with the Avent drop-in bottles and find that the Lasinoh bags work the best with this system. I am ordering other types of bags to try... but so far Lasinoh bags work the best. If anyone is interested, I can post a picture of the adapters connected to the drop in bottles with the storage bags.
This product surely protects my leather seats but my car seat seat slides around on the seat when its in place. i'm taking mine out of the car today. I'll try it again when my son moves out of the infant carrier and into the big car seat.
I think this is a waste of money.  Not very useful.  There are better ones out there.
I have three children so when I saw this product when we had our last child I bought it.  I remembered all of the stains from the first two that we had a terrible time getting out.  We do have a SUV w/cloth seats but still had trouble with the base moving.  This solved our problem.  Now the seat stays still and the handy storage is great for extra diapers in case you run out in your diaper bag!  Worth every penny!
We had our car seat checked at the local police station, and the safety officer recommended that we not use anything under our car seat.  In case of an accident or a problem with the car seat, using any additional product (such as this mat or an attached fleece covering) may void the warranty of your car seat!
Very durable and easy to cleanWarms up milk in about 2-3 minThere's no indicator that shows exactly how warm your milk will be but using common sense and maybe your fingers.... Should be enough
Personally, I love this bottle warmer. It has worked perfectly since the moment I started using it. You need to watch how much water you put in it; however, because if you put too much water in it and are only making about 2 ounces, you will end up making the water in the bottle too hot for baby to eat. My husband has done this a few times and has had to put the bottle in the fridge or freezer for a few mins to cool the water down before adding the formula. This of course is not the products fault but the fault of the person using the warmer. I am considering purchasing another one so we can have one in our room (instead of getting up and going to the kitchen for late night feedings) and one in the kitchen for daytime feedings.
We bought this for warming milk bottles for our baby, cold ones from the fridge and room temp water for formula. It is a very good product.Pros:- Quick and easy to use- Warms liquid uniformly- Fits bottles of all sizes, including the odd shape Tommee TippeeCons:- The steam is very hot and picking bottle out during heating can cause burns if not done carefully- No temp control, and thus getting the right temp is a hit and miss and requires trial/error everytime- Once the heater switches off, need to wait for 5-10 mins before using a second time (we did find a workaround of pouring cold water to let the element cool which allows immediate reheating)A must have for every nursery and mom whether warming formula or preserved breast milk from the fridge
I find that I have trouble getting each bottle to the perfect temperature.  It either under or overheats about half the time.  But it is convenient and compact and it does do it's job even on the wideneck bottles.  Wish it came with a travel pouch/carry handle b/c I take it with me for overnight traveling
As a first time mother, I thought this would be a great purchase. I was wrong! It takes way too long to heat up, it would be just as fast holding the bottle under hot water. Don't waste your money on this!
The bottles do get warmed up with the max water measurement. Does take about 3-4 minutes which seems like a long time if the baby is really hungry, Overall does the job
Takes too long to warm bottles which were on the fridge. You either have to warm it twice, put in double the amount of water or place bottle in a bowl of hot water. However, for bottles at room temperature, it is perfect. Actually they somestimes can get too warm and have to be cooled
We bought this bottle warmer after the Avent warmer was not available. I must say I am pleasantly surprised!1-It is compact, which takes up a lot less counter space than the other bottle warmers.  During the day we use the bottle in the kitchen and at night we take it upstairs to our bathroom for easy feedings.2-The price! It is half the price of the Avent warmer and has an auto shut-off mode.3-Auto Shut-off! In most cases, you'd have to buy a more expensive bottle warmer just for auto shutoff feature.4-Easy to clean and even easier to use. We use tap water with our warmer and no problem...but we do clean it out every day--quick wipe. I haven't seeen any residue from using tap water. Also, I've accidentally spilled milk in the warmer and it was a breeze to clean.I would have given this warmer 5 stars except it can be hit or miss with the amount of water you have to add in order to warm the contents. I usually aim low (just to take the chill out of the milk) so it really doesn't bother me and baby doesn't mind either. We're also heating up about 3 ozs in an 8 oz bottle so that may have something to do with the varying temperature.Overall, I highly recommend this bottle warmer. It beats standing in front of a running faucet or boiling water just to warm some milk.
I think this warmer is awesome.  It's very portable, easy to use, and works fast.  We keep it in the car, which has an outlet in the center console, for when we are out and about and its feeding time.
I work part time and EBF my son. This bottle warmer is perfect for my husband to use to heat up pumped milk while i'm at work.it's very quick and easy to use, especially when you have a screaming hungry infant!I only recomend to not use it if you are using the playtex nurser inserts, they get way to hot even on the lowest setting. All other bottles work awesome though!
This warmer is small enough to go back and forth with my daughter to her sitter's every day in her diaper bag.  I would leave it there, but my husband uses it if she gets hungry and Im not home from work yet.  I get a brown residue on the bottom, but I attribute that to the water quality, because I get it on my steam sterlizer, which is a different brand.
We've been using this bottle warmer for 3 mo's.  Mommy pumps milk, refrigerates it and then we heat it when it's time to feed.  We love this warmer!  It takes up very little counter space and heats consistently time after time.  When the milk is ready it shuts off automatically so we can multi-task.  It was priced right, too!
Ladies, listen to me. You're probably thinking, &#34;do I really need this thing?&#34; - maybe not, you're blessed by nature to have food producers attached to your upper torso. However, you will make Dad's life so much easier with this little thing.Imagine with me. You're at work (or gone somewhere) and your husband is at home taking care of little Jessica all alone.  Jessica gets hungry, and starts to fuss a little. For you, normally you'd probably think &#34;No big deal, I'll just whip out my food bringers.&#34; Not so easy for dad though, is it? Nope. For us, it's - ok, Jessica is upset because she's hungry. I can't put her down, because then she gets even more upset. So I have to hold her. Now I have exactly one free hand to fix her milk. What are my options:(A) I could use a stove. Sure, it works.  But do you (mom) really want me (dad) dangling our infant daughter around a red hot stove? Not just the stove, but boiling water to try and heat the milk? Do you trust me that much? Nope. I know you don't. Don't lie.(B) This thing. Instead of me messing with a stove, a pot, several cups of (boiling) water, waiting for it to boil (and trust me, with a crying child in your arms, it seems to take forever), and potentially burning my daughter in the process, why not try the easier way? I get the bottle of milk out of the fridge, pop a couple ounces of water into the BabyPro, set the bottle in, click a button, and wait for about 30 seconds to test.  Still a little cold?  No biggie, just repeat.  All in all, my bottle is ready in 60-90 seconds - all done with the power of one hand. Best of all, my daughter doesn't have to cry for 10 minutes while I wait for water to boil and the bottle to heat up.That's my story. If you're not going to get this for you - at least consider it for Dad.Pros:-- Instructions are clear (and pretty easy to remember)-- Easy to use (even with one arm)-- Milk temperature is adjustable by you; it might take a few times to get it right, but after that it's easy peasy.-- Most bottles fit well, even the Comotomo (made to mimic the boob, and avoid nipple confusion - highly recommended)-- Small - doesn't take up much counter spaceCons:-- Not very easy to clean - I've read something about vinegar. I don't know.
I was really disappointed with this warmer it takes a long time to heat and it heats unevenly. Also, according to the chart for the amount of water us I find myself using more than what it says if not I end up with cold milk.
I wasn't sure if we really "needed" this product, but now that I have it, I can't imagine life without it! If you breastfeed, and are using pumped or express milk, this is a must have. I just pour the milk into the bottle, plop it in the warmer, and it is heated to the perfect temperature with the touch of a button! I don't have to worry about boiling water or anything. The steam heats it perfectly every time! I highly recommend this product.
Totally worth the cost, it's very cheap and effective, you don't need all the other fancier ones. I warm up eight ounces at a time and use the max water- perfectly warm each time.
I reluctantly gave this product 5 stars because...#1 - IT'S THE FASTEST WARMER ON THE MARKET.It's PERFECT for my Playtex drop-in/liner bottlesIt's compactIt also heats foodIt automatically shuts off and therefore...It can be left plugged inNo cleaning neededThe instructions are simpleHere's how to really use this product.-Throw out the instructions the manufacturer provides-Fill that vial to the max with water-Dump all the water into the warmer-Place your bottle in there-Periodically check your bottle... like after a minute and then every 15-20 seconds after that swirling/shaking between checks-ServeMy nighttime routine usually goes like this... get the 6oz bottle, fill the vial to the max, pour the water in the warmer and turn it on, place the bottle inside the warmer, go to the bathroom, return and check bottle, place the bottle back in the warmer, check one or two more times and it's usually ready, set aside.  Change the baby's diaper, feed her, put her back down and she's out.Is the warmer perfectly consistent?  No.  But is any method consistent?  Only if you use a crock pot with a temperature nob.  Who has room for that?  Plus that can't be safe and you'd have to clean it.Is it capable of overheating?  Absolutely.  Same goes for boiling water, microwaving water, or for those of you who live on the wild side - microwaving the bottle.Do the vial measuring lines suck?  Yes.  See the first step in my directions and this con won't matter.Do you have to stick around?  Yes.  Only because this warmer is so fast and speed is more important to me.  I want to feed this baby fast.  The longer she's up at night, the harder it is for her to fall back to sleep and sleep is a high priority for me.Do you have to wait 10 minutes after one heating session?  Yes... and I can't defend this feature, it's dumb.  That's why I fill the vial to the max and work backwards.  Any remaining water just burns away.  But my method really works for me because I use disposable liner bottles and those are easier to heat.  It is awful for the solid bottles, I don't know what works best for those.Okay, I think I've covered all.  Again, I only gave this 5 stars because of its speed.  When something is invented that can heat a bottle to a specific temperature just a fast, I will switch.
I was so excited to purchase this for such a low price. I hated thinking about thawing milk on the stove while my baby sat waiting & hungry, so I couldn't wait to try this quicker approach.However, when I read the manual, it stated the warmer could only be used once every TEN minutes. I prayed and hoped it would thaw it out the 1st try so my baby wouldn't get fussy while waiting for it.Unfortunately, after using the warmer, the milk was still mostly frozen and had "hot spots." As you know, this is the reason you don't use the microwave. So I ended up sticking the milk in a cup of hot water from the sink and waiting 10 minutes instead.The next time I tried to use this, I tried recently expressed milk from the refrigerator. I thought surely it would be better this time since it was not frozen.No such luck. It made the milk WAY too hot, and on top of that the unit was oozing some kind of bronze colored metallic substance. EW. I don't know what happened, since I followed instructions clearly.This was the biggest waste of money. I recommend filling a mug with water, microwaving for 2 or 3 minutes and then placing the milk container in the hot water. This way, milk is warm fairly quickly, there are no hot spots, no breastmilk nutrients are lost, and most importantly--it's FREE! :)
I didn't plan on having to pump breast milk, my daughter was of course going to latch with no problems (oh how we plan). So when I got this gift at my baby shower I just smiled and packed it away until she needed to eat solid food.I've been using bottles since she was five days old and this has been a life saver. The vial of water requires some trial and error to make sure the bottle isn't too warm or too cold but other than that no issues.I haven't had as much luck with using it to heat up solid food. It always seems to be a little cool, no matter how much water I put in the vial.
We have a new baby boy that was born about a month ago. My wife and I have divided our duties and I'm the lucky chap who gets up at night and feeds him. She keeps a supply of breast milk in the fridge. Of course, I must warm up the milk and we purchased "The First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer" for that purpose. It's handy and easy to use, even in my sleep-deprived condition.I'm not totally satisfied with this product. First of all, the cap holder broke off the little measuring vile almost right from the start. There's no way to fix it. Oh well, fixing it isn't essential, but it gives me the feeling that this bottle warmer might be a cheap piece of junk. Secondly, the bottle warmer heats the milk too hot if the instructions are followed precisely. Experimenting a bit, I have found that if four ounces of milk are to be heated to the desired temperature in the bottle, then the little measuring vile for water (added to the warmer) should be filled only to three. Go figure. Once you get that little calibration problem worked out, everything seems to work satisfactorily. Using it is fairly quick and easy. Otherwise, the warmer is nice looking and easy to keep clean. Hopefully it will last as long as needed.Gary Peterson
I did not have one of these for my first son. When I had my second, I just went ahead and bought one in hopes it would make my life easier...boy, did it! Nothing is more stressful than a hungry baby crying...this got the bottle warm so quick!
This is a great product...a must have for nursing mothers who pump and also for formula babies! It's simple and to the point. Never had a problem with it. Takes a little to figure out how much water to use for the right temp, but not too hard.
I have not used this product yet but the price was right, the quality of the product looks good, and I am looking forward to seeing the result of its use.
This bottle warmer was horrible. If you are formula-feeding, just use the microwave. Really. It takes so much less time, and all you have to do is shake the bottle really well to eliminate hotspots.This bottle warmer never heated bottles evenly. Sometimes they would be scalding hot, sometimes ice cold (and then you have to wait until it's completely cooled down before it will allow you to heat it again!). Not only that, but it always took a minimum of 5 minutes to heat the bottle. Meanwhile, my baby is screaming because he's hungry and wants that bottle!! The microwave only takes 30 seconds and it's the same temperature EVERY time.If you're heating expressed breastmilk I can see why someone would need a bottle warmer.Otherwise, what is the point??
This bottle warmer is probably the best $16 I've spent for the sheer convenience of being able to warm a bottle quickly.  Like others have mentioned, it takes an incredibly long time to warm a bottle in a pan of hot water when you have a crying baby who wants to eat immediately ~ so, this little product is great since it only takes a few minutes to warm up a bottle.There is definitely a bit of a learning curve to this product so that you get the temperature you want every time.  The warmer does come with a guide of how much water to use to create the steam heat and I've used this as a starting point.  My baby seems to like room temperature fluids so actually warming a bottle for her takes literally a minute or two at most since I am not heating to a higher temperature. Also, I learned the hard way that adding even just a few more drops of water (say filling to the 8 instead of the 7 on the little measuring dispenser) makes a huge temperature difference, so once you know exactly how much water you need, stick with it.  The other variable to this device is the little plastic ring that is placed over the top of the warmer (it states "Not to be used with disposable bottles" around the top of it) adds to keeping the steam within the warming chamber- so if you take it off it make take an extra bit of water to get the milk warmed to baby's preference.  I took this ring off because I just couldn't get it to sit flat over the removable basket.The product is fairly small and doesn't take up too much counter space, something that was also important to me since I hate clutter on kitchen counters.  The one thing I don't care for about this product is the way the little water dispenser attaches to the side, or rather how it doesn't really attach easily to the side.  I am sure others know what I mean at 3AM when you barely have your eyes open and try to slide that sucker into the grooves just right...ya, not easy.I've only had this item for about a month, so I can't speak to the longevity of it, but so far I am very happy with it, and should it break I would purchase another just for the convenience of it.
With all the restrictions on how you can warm breastmilk, this was the best thing.  Works great everytime and never too hot.  Love it.  Works better then others we have tried.  Very quick and easy.
I've got twins, so the routine is to throw one bottle on the warmer, change the first, prop the first, throw second bottle on the warmer, change the second, prop the second, burp the first, and so on.Few tips...1. Keep your fingers away from the steam!2. The second bottle will heat up with a bit less water than the first.3. The bottle width will change how much water is required.  Figure if the steam can't escape as easily because you've got a wider bottle, it'll heat up quicker.
I don't use a whole bunch of bottles since I nurse, but occasionally I thaw out some breast milk for when my daughter and I are going to be out in very public places for a long period of time.  This works great.  I just put the milk in the warmer and in about four minutes it is done.  Sometimes however, when I have a 7 ounce pack it takes a few times through it to get it all the way warmed.  Since I am using this for when I am out it isn't a big deal that it takes awhile, especially because you have to wait for the warmer to cool all the way down before you can use it again.  However, when I use it to heat milk from the frig so my husband can feed her, it works great.  I wouldn't suggest walking away from it because sometimes it gets too hot when the whole four minutes is given to heat.  Walking away while heating a bottle is not wise anyway, so it really isn't a problem standing there for it and it is a whole lot quicker than boiling water.
Good concept, poor execution. Hard to use, and the instruction manuals suggested water amounts are way off base, in my experience. Wife and I got so frustrated with the warmer's inconsistent results that we've gone back to the old fashioned warming method - setting the bottle in a cup of warm water. That method works much better. The bottle warmer concept is solid and attractive, but this particular model fails. Do not buy.
For the $15(ish) price, I'd say that this bottle warmer works well.  I mix all the bottles in the morning, put them in the refrigerator and use this to heat up the formula so that it is not freezing cold.  I don't know how accurate the water-lines are because after experimenting with various amounts of water I don't think we've actually had a &#34;warm&#34; bottle yet - rather its just not cold - which I am completely fine with because I don't particularly want my baby becoming accustom to warm bottles when we are out or in the middle of the night.  I would purchase this product again, however, if your baby needs a warm bottle I'd say you probably need a better/more expensive machine.
I love this bottle warmer. I am a first time mom and this has been a life saver. Great quality and price. I would highly recommend this product and company.If this was a helpful review please select the &#8216;yes&#8217; button below.
This works great, and is super fast at heating up the bottles, but the only problem is that the bottles Im using (the breast flow 4oz) are short enough that pulling them out gets you steam burns on your fingers, and thats if you can grasp it! Doesn't matter if the cap is on or the nipple, the lip of the tops are just under the ridge of the warmer so it's hard to grasp.
I love this bottle warmer! The insrtruction is a little bit off, but all you have to do is to experiment, and once you've found the right amount of water you need to put in there, just stick with it. It works great for me, and warms the bottles very fast.
I am currently breast-feeding, but pump a bottle for my husband to use to feed our daughter at night.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to invest in one more thing - especially since we weren't going to need it constantly, but I'm very GLAD we did!  It saves time and makes a perfect bottle every time!As some of the other reviewers note, you DO need to read the directions to find out how much water to use with the amount of liquid you are heating.  For example, use the marking of 7 ml of water on the included measuring tool for 3-4 oz of milk or formula.  The measuring tool attaches to the side of the warmer so that it is always handy.All you do is measure the water and pour it into the warmer, then add the bottle.  Do not have a lid or nipple already on the bottle.  As long as you use the right amount AND wait for the water to evaporate entirely and turn itself off, you get a perfect bottle!  I like that you have a light that goes off when it's done.  It's a good visual cue that you can see from across the room.  You can also hear when the last of the water evaporates (a small hiss).I've used Dr. Brown's bottles - both the 4oz and 8 oz size - and it works great.
This is one of the cheaper bottle warmers out there and it performs perfectly.  All you do is pour a little bit of water in and press the lever.  The lever is green while warming, and turns to red when it's done.  There is also auto-shutoff for extra safety.  This is a very simple product to use.I've used this on many different brands of bottles including Dr. Brown's and Medela.  It only needs a minute or two to make milk from the fridge warm enough for baby.  It can do frozen milk too, but it will take few minutes longer.  My brother uses this to warm his son's baby food and it works perfectly for that also.After using this one I see no reason to buy one of the more expensive models you may find in a baby store.
Just put some water in and give it 3-4 mins and your bottles are warm.  I went through 3 different kinds of bottles and they all fit in the warmer.  It doesn't take up a lot of space and it also warms jarred food.
totally not working! returned it. you had to add hot water to heat the bottle while it does not work.
2 weeks of use. It doesn't shut off so it overheats and smells like burnt plastic. Dangerous item.When it was working, it is really long to heat up a bottle on top of the headache to figure out the amount of water to add. My screaming hungry baby hated it, took many minutes for a 3oz bottle and it was either too cold or too hot.
I like that the unit doesn't take up a lot of space, it's light weight and only needs a small amount of water to warm the bottle. It accommodates every size bottle I've tried so far (Gerber, Playtex Drop-ins and Dr. Brown). I didn't completely read all of the directions and didn't realize I had to let the machine completely cool down before you can heat it again...I thought it was broken! It warms the milk well but I keep a cloth next to it to dry the bottle off before using and also cool the plastic on the bottle before using.
Way much better than munchkin brand. No hot spots at all. I should have bought this a long time ago.
We did have to find out how much water to use for specific amounts of milk, but after figuring that, we really like the bottle warmer. It's easy to operate even in the dark (just prepare the water up front). We also like the fact that it can be operated with one hand (while carrying the baby in the other hand)- very useful. Also, does not take too much space on our counter. We are very happy with this bottle warmer!An update- this can also be used for heating up jars of baby food (just remove the upper ring)- so convenient.Also, by adding cold water immediately after the bottle warmer stops you can cool the heating element, which will enable to turn it on again without waiting. Good product!
We have the First Years Day and Night Bottle Warmer (with the cooler on the back) for use upstairs, and loved it so much that I decided to order what I assumed to be the same item without the cooler for the kitchen counter downstairs. It never heated the bottles as well as the one that we had, and the bottles gradually got less and less warm, until the warmer didn't work at all. We used it less than ten times, and the entire thing totally crapped out. I ignored the bad reviews and really, really wanted to like this item because I love the cooler/bottle warmer so much! Back to Amazon it goes!
This product is small and compact yet very helpful for those middle of the night feedings when you are exhausted and you need the hubby to warm up a bottle to feed the baby! Obviously useful for other reasons but that's why we bought it!  Warming a bottle to the right temp is tricky but this warmer makes it easy.It is tricky to get the right formula down for heating.  At first we were following the directions, a little difficult to understand, and the milk from the fridge came out cool but not body temp warm like from the breast.  So it took a few tries to get used to the amount of water you have to put in, but obviously the more water the more steam and the warmer the milk came out.  It comes with a little measuring device.
This is the first bottle warmer I have ordered, and it is one of the best I have ever used. I find it super easy to use, super easy to clean, and it gets the bottles to just the right temperature. It is also useful for travel, and can be set up easily in a hotel room. This is absolutely one of the best bottle warmers I have ever worked with. I would definitely suggest it to friends and family, and I actually have done so!
When our son decides he's hungry, he does not want to wait for the traditional method of placing the bottle in a bowl of warm water.  This warmer is so fast!  It's ready in less than 4 minutes (we allow for it to cool a bit before taking it out).  Once you figure out how much water you need to fill for your type of bottle/milk, it works like a charm!  We use Dr. Brown's Wide Neck bottles and they fit just fine (as long as we remember to remove the straw first, otherwise the milk rised out).
This product is simple and easy to use, but it's not reliable. Even if you put the same amount of water in it and a bottle with the same amount of milk each time - the temperature will be different. This can also be dangerous. I've placed a bottle in this warmer only to find it's half cold. Adding more water continues the heating process, but now the milk can reach a dangerously high temperature.  Many times I've had to add a little cold milk, to make the bottle safe to use. I initially liked this product, but am ditching it because of its unreliability.
For the first week, we warmed bottles in tap water.  It was time consuming and inconvenient.  Not to mention that half-full Avent bottles float so you have to hold it in the cup/bowl of water the entire time.  This product warms up bottles in minutes and it is so easy to use.  It has a little thing on that side that slides off so you can add the water to that and dump it in.  (You can use more or less water depending on the size of the bottle and the amount of &quot;warming&quot; needed with very little effort.)  It heats to a perfect level each time.  When it is through, it shuts itself off so you don't have to remember to do it yourself.The only problem is that the inside has turned a little brown from the heat (burned-like) but since it hasn't affected anything, it doesn't seem to matter.
It may be my son only but he doesn't care if his bottles are cold or warm and I use water that is in gallon containers which sit on the counter so his bottles are generally at room temperature anyway.  This product did work, however, for my standard size Playtex Vent Air bottles but did not heat up my friend's wide mouth bottles when she tried to use it.  All in all, this was a pointless purchase on my part; but the return of the item was easy cheesy!
We are using Medela bottles with Haberman nipples and using the directions provided it works great without any issues. Only had it for a couple weeks so don't know quality and I will write another review if it fails.
This warmer is a life saver! It gets the job done quickly and with very little effort and time. It is also safe for Playtex liners and it will warm more than just milk.  It warms my baby's purees just as good as water and faster
We bought this warmer to heat up bottles for our new baby, and so far we've only used it for that purpose. It's okay for $15. We use it several times a day so it is at least worth that. It's a really cheap, crappy looking design, but I guess you get what you pay for.Pros:- Does the job most of the time. Probably helps that our baby is not too picky when it comes to bottle temperature.- Done heating fast, usually in under 2 minutes.Cons:- Cheap feel/design/on button- Doesn't heat the bottle too well, even with "max" amount of water. Formula ends up lukewarm. We use this to heat up 4 oz. of formula, I can't imagine how poorly it will heat bigger bottles!- You can't turn it off once it's on by pushing the button. It does turn itself off after the heat cycle is done, though.- Could be a fire hazard, saw a spark under the unit the first week I had it. Hasn't done it since, however it's probably not a good idea to leave the unit on & walk away.Overall it's just okay. Not too impressed, I'm sure there are better models out there but this one does the job for now.UPDATE: Updating to say this bottle warmer only lasted baby's first 3 months. It rusted on the inside despite maintenance, and we were even careful not to leave liquid sitting in it. Since it's rusted so badly we can't use it for our upcoming baby. We've been using a hot glass of water to heat bottles and that works better than this warmer. I changed my rating to 2 stars because for the price, it did work for a while, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Great warmer. Can't imagine bottle feeding without it. Well made and easy to use and clean. Don't let calcification build up a lot or it's more difficult to clean.
I love this warmer because it's so easy to use.  Who wants complications at 4am?  The milk has come out too hot only one time.  Simple to fix-just add less water next time.  It fits all the bottles I have, is fast, and it doesn't take up much counter space.
When I first bought this, over a year ago, I was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands. Rest assured, this is all you will need! My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum. This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy, I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer(that comes with) poor it in and left it alone. It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes, it was the perfect temperature. This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars (Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose) The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating! Outside is easy to clean (the water deposits on the warmer - not so much) All in all It did the job for my little boy. And for $16 GET IT! And Get one for the Grandparents! Don't spend $30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing!
Use this for every feeding for my twins. The water measuring tube is a pain to attach to the unit when you are not using it. I do wish it was quicker but think I would want that feature with any bottle warmer. This works very well.
I bought this warmer thinking it's more convenient than warming milk with hot water, but actually it is not...the amount of water needed is little therefore it has to be very precise to get to the temperature you want! It takes longer to fill the correct amount of water than needed.  Also you have to wait 10 minutes to try again, if a bottle is not warm enough, you have to use something else anyway! The instructions state that the unit needs 10 minutes to cool down if you need to use it again, but it may actually take longer than that...I would prefer to use hot water than using this warmer.
I bought this warmer before I gave birth and knew that I would need it especially at night. It is very effective and is easy to use. I would advise ppl not to fill the water vile unless you are warming up maybe 8 oz of thickened milk. I will make it hot. Based on frequency of usage you will learn how much water to use. I mainly do the water vile half way unless the milk was previously refrigerated and cold. It is better to use this product than a microwave with your baby's breast milk.
Works great!  I use it to heat up her bottle and her frozen homemade baby food.  I definitely recommend. I even thought about using this when my husband and I go camping to heat up our adult food.  We could just plug it into our car adapter.
I am a breastfeeder.  But, every now and again, my husband gives our baby a bottle of breastmilk.  We are past the point of sleep deprivation, so I don't blame the use of this product on not enough sleep - it really is very confusing to use.The directions are quite unclear and the chart used to tell you how much water to put in is even more unclear.  Several times, we have put too much water in, and the bottle gets way too hot, which is dangerous!This is only my opinion and I do not believe has anything to do with lack of intelligence.
We used this everyday, multiple times a day, for over a year and had no problems at all.  It took a little bit to figure out how much water to use with which bottle, but once we got that down it was simple to put the water in, push the button and a few min. later have a warm bottle for our daughter.  We have used hot tap water to try and warm a bottle and it just takes too long for formula out of the refrigerator.  We never tried heating up food so I can't comment on that part of the warmer.
This warmer works great! It's one of the few that you can put the bottles with liners in.  I use the Playtex Nursers, and this works perfect for them.  The only draw back I was concerned with was that you can't heat right after you've heated...you have to wait about 5 minutes (most say that anyway).  That is not a problem if you know how much water to put in it the first time.  It is fast too!  We got the first couple bottles too hot, but after that it was easy.  There are little lines on the side of the measuring cup, for a 4 oz bottle, I go to the first big water line (about half way up the "scale").  That is for refrigerated milk.  Plus, this warmer doesn't take up a lot of space.  It's just what you need, no more or less. It says you can do baby food in it too, but I'm not that far yet. I defintely recommend this warmer.
We went through every bottle with our son and this warmer fit them all without problem. Provide a simply warm bottle every time
First off, mine was white and it looks like they changed the shape and color now, whether that matters, I don't really know, or care. This is the most awful product. We tried it 3 times, once actually following direction, then twice adding more water to see if it makes any difference. Nope. It doesn't work. The ONLY thing it does is get the actual bottle hot. Almost too hot to the touch, but if you test out the actual formula, it was literally ice-cold. Like straight from the fridge. Awful, awful product. I find these mixed reviews odd, because apparently for some, it actually works and for others, like me, it doesn't do ANYTHNG. I don't know about those positive reviews, but for me, it was just utterly dissapointing. Pity really, it would have been SO convenient to warm a bottle up as quickly as it says(1 minute, I believe). But we have to continue doing it the old-fashioned way.
I got this because after a couple nights of cranky colic baby, there was no way in hell I was going through that again! So I hear warming the milk makes it easier on the tummy (also making sure the bottles are  good for him and formula that agrees). I (and my wife) have 3 different bottle types,the Medela breastfeeding bottles, the Avent standard/naturals and the Playtex Ventaires. These all fit into this warmer which has an accessory ring to keep them in place although the skinny Medela float/bob around in there a little if there is only 10 or 20 mls of milk in there.Why this warmer is better than others I seen/used:-it feels quality enough. It's not a brick but it doesn't feel like it out shatter if you sneezed on it. Solid enough.- it can be cleaned. Some other models with built in water reservoirs are a bacteria trap. eventually it would need a scrub. This one comes with a removable measure that can be cleaned. The unit itself, you can remove all the baskets (which it comes with a basket for prepared food jars!) and get in there to clean it out.- It turns on with a simple push down on the switch without the whole plug/unplug the cord. Green lights on the conveniently big button lights on and it will automatically shut off when the water you poured in is gone. No more plugging and unplugging. Trust me you will appreciate this button. It's big enough that even I can hit it half asleep no problem! Don't search for a small switch or button when you're half asleep with a crying baby in one arm...that's insane.- Small profile, I would say it has about the footprint of a magic bullet blender. Not bad since the counter lost alot of its space to baby bottle holders/racks etc..- The price..I've seen some crazy prices on some and this certainly is the bang for the buck! I was not buying one for 60+ dollars but I didn't want a cheapo one that broke quick or is more of a hassel to monitor. This was it...winner! Less than 25 dollars, auto shut off, easy to clean, compact enough and warmed well. As everyone else says bottle warming is not an exact science but when you figure your method, you make it as consistent as you can.PRO?CON? - it does shut itself off however there is a learning curve to the amount of water you put into the chamber and how much milk/water is in the bottle. For example, some of the other models adjust temperature by adding more water into the chamber and it just heats a preset time. This unit actually times itself by the amount of time it takes to boil off the water in the chamber. So if you pour in 7 (or less)on the included measure, it will heat up 4 oz water/formula to pretty warm in about 3-4 min max.How do I adjust the temp? - Let's say if I go for 4 oz of formula. I will put a little less than 7 in the measurer into the chamber. Pour in 3 oz of distilled/nursery water only in the bottle. Drop the bottle in the chamber and hit the button. It will shut off by the time I measure the power and put the baby bib on. Take it out, pour my final oz of cold water in and then mix the powder in and it is immediately ready to go. Whatever system works for you but this method instantly brings the mixture down to perfect warmth. The manual and the back of the unit has the handy measure scale in case you need it anyways.Overall, if the baby's tummy is more comfortable because warmer milk is easier for him, then we're happy. I can't complain about the money spent here. It's worth the few more hours of peace and quiet. I hope this helps.UPDATE: use it like mad and it's still working like new. Baby is up to 4oz or more and I find using the minimal line is just fine. By the time you give the water a swirl with the powder and the outside of the bottle is still fairly warm, the remaining coolness of the water inside cancels out the residual outer heat to make it ready to feed immediately. Awesome!UPDATE 9/18/2013: Still rockin and I even ordered another warmer for upstairs. I think it is a great bang for the buck and now with winter creeping around, most definitely will be used like crazy! Again, bottle warming is not an exact science so get that dream out of your head, you just need to figure what works warmer water-to-bottle volume ratio and stick to it. I planned it so once I see him hungry or already crying for it, I pour the water into the warmer, hit the button, pour the water into the bottle - drop the bottle in and start measuring out the formula. By the time I have the scoop loaded and ready, the warming is done and I mix, shake and feed. It really isn't that complicated, just takes some logical planning. Play it right, the whole process is quick and efficient.
This unit works very quickly to heat the four ounce bottles for our son, however you must watch the amount of water you add as it will overheat the bottles if left on for too long. The water level determines the length the unit runs so I just stand over it and watch it for the 60-90 seconds it takes instead of ending up with an overheated bottle that I have to let cool down.
I'm quite convinced now that late pregnancy and early post-partum are probably the worst periods of time to try to figure out gadgets that don't have clear instructions. In my case, although there was a warning that a basket should always be used in the warmer, my brain erased that comment with the subsequent paragraph that said wide mouth bottles don't require the lift out basket. To be clearer, in both places it should say that the large basket is always required (otherwise you are heating the bottle directly on the plate and also in boiling water... both of which are no-nos.The instructions are also too simplistic. The type of bottle one uses (shape, size, material) will very dramatically affect how the heat from the steam impacts the solution being heated. I would also imagine that some further tweaking will be required as the composition of breastmilk changes during the day and over the course of the post partum period.For example, I used 9 oz MAM Ultivent (BPA free) translucent bottles that are wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. In my successful experiment with water chilled in the fridge to about 40 F, I needed to add 2x the max level in the provided measuring tube to get the water up to about 80 F. The unit was on for about 6 minutes until the water all vaporized. This is more than 2x the amount generally recommended in the instruction sheet and the sticker plastered to the side of the unit has even less detail.Note that if you make the mistake of running the unit without any basket, some overheat sensor will trip before the water is completely used up after about a minute or so.Given that there is unlikely any product out there which monitors the temp of the solution being heated (or is otherwise aware of what kind of bottle/solution combo is in place), trial and error and patience will be required with any such product. Life will probably be easier for formula babies since formula doesn't change over time!Good luck!p.s. a water softener with regular applications of rust-inhibitor solution, or the use of distilled water will probably reduce the amount of cleaning required. Using vinegar to remove mineral deposits is the age old standard for cleaning everything from pots and pans to humidifiers etc.
We're so glad we bought this bottle warmer.  We brought it with us for traveling and it worked great at hotel. I wish we had gotten it earlier.
It is way so powerful that it splashes the liquid everywhere..my point of buying this product was to help the formula less bubbling when mixing..but it created more..what a disappointment..
With my 8th child who is currently 6 weeks old we had to use Dr Brown bottles. You aren't supposed to shake powdered formula in that bottle. So we were looking for a way to mix the formula when we found this product. This product works and well. It should be pulsed when mixing. It is very powerful. If you use it wrong it will be like using a hammer to kill a fly. I am very glad to have found this product. My only complaint is for sanitary reasons it should have an option for a case.
My wife picked up this interesting little gizmo and I get a kick out of using it. Boy, it will really mix a bottle of formula fast! And no lumps or clots to stick in the nipple. Basically, our son is fed mother's milk, but he's growing fast, has a growing hunger and sometimes mom just can't keep up. So, she pumps milk and we mix a little formula in with her milk to ease the situation. Our boy doesn't like straight formula and grimaces and refuses to consume it (unless he's extremely hungry). However, he'll take a 50/50 mixture of mother's milk and formula without even noticing, so that's what he's getting at times and this little mixer will really churn them together. I have only two dislikes for the mixer. First, it spins so fast and powerful that it foams the milk. So far, this has not been a major problem, especially since I let the mix set a bit, and I'm careful with the mixing so that it isn't overly churned. Second, it is a bit awkward to use in tall bottles. Some reviews have complained of durability problems, but we've had none as yet.I wonder what else I can use a gizmo like this for. Hmmmmm. It might be real good at the bar for fixing small pitchers of martinis. The problem is I don't have a bar and don't drink martinis. Maybe I could use one in the workshop for mixing and stirring up small amounts of paint. Maybe, I'll give it some more thought.Gary Peterson
I got this formula mixer for my son who is eating more and more so shaking 6 bottles at a pop can be annoying. Plus shaking sometimes doesn't get the clumps out and with this I get a nice even mixture. I use this on my 11 oz Avent bottles and it comes in very handy when shaking doesn't cut it.The reason I took a star off is because it is mainly a glorified cake mixer slapped with a baby label and justified with a price hike. It takes a while to get used to otherwise there will be a big mess. I have no qualms with this product but I wouldn't go out of my way to push it due to the price and what it is. If moms think it will be helpful, go get it! Best of luck!
The mixer seems very handy but I could not use it as I intended because it would not fit down far enough in Dr. Brown's 8-ounce bottles (regular width, not sure about wide).
I sure wish I knew about this before I was on baby #3.  I wandered across this at Babies 'R' Us.  No more leaking bottles as you try to shake powdered formula with water (and just get lumps!).  About 4 seconds of this blender right in the bottle and milk is TOTALLY blended.  Doesn't spatter, even in small (4 oz) bottles; easy one-hand operation (while bottle is sitting on counter and baby is in the other arm!).  Then just rinse the end and set aside for next time.  On button has both pulse and on (I only ever use pulse because it's that fast).  Takes 2 AA batteries.
This really makes sure that the formula is mixed without clumps.  Lifetime of it is poor, but at such an low price with high return, it is worth buying a couple.  I would have given it five stars if it did not break so frequently.
I bought these bottles as well as the Avent bottles and I have to say these are much better than the Avent bottles.  My daughter got too many bubbles in her bottle with the Avent bottles.  The Dr. Browns eliminate all bubbles.  She has no problems with gas when we use these bottles so I have stopped using the Avent bottles all together.
I bought these bottles with the hopes that they'd reduce my baby's gas and fussiness.  I thought these were the answer based on all the great reviews they got on this site.  However, the stage 1 nipple was way too fast for my baby, and it caused her to spit up nearly everything I had just fed her at every single feeding!  I kept thinking she just needed to get used to the nipple flow, so I stuck with it.  But she just got fussier and fussier because she was spitting up everything at each feeding.  I went back to the Vent Aire bottle I started out with.  The stage 1 nipple on the Vent Aire is slow, but my baby keeps all her formula down now.
I bought these bottles on a lark.  I had read good things about them, but when I went to buy them at my Babies R Us, the only ones I could buy were the wide mouthed bottles.  These bottles have a wider nipple that is shaped more like the breast.  My son is primarily breast fed, but he has had no problems with these bottles when I don't feed him myself.  I started giving him a few ounces of water at 2 weeks old, and he immediately took to these bottles.  At one month, I tried to give him a six ounce Platex VentAir bottle after my Babies R Us was out of the larger Dr. Browns bottles.  He refused to take to the smaller nipple.  I suggest that you do use the wide mouth Dr. Browns bottles, but they are not available online.I have not had a problem cleaning them at all.  The only problem I have had comes when I do give him formula.  The instructions say not to shake it in the bottle, so I usually stir it instead.  One reviewer mentioned that when you add water, you go over the "Do not fill above this line" mark.  I avoid this by measuring my water in a separate bottle, then I add about half the water, stir, then the other half.  That has eliminated any problem regarding that mark.I strongly recommend this product!
Loved these bottles...never had problems with gas or bubbles. It is more effort to clean, due to the extra parts, but it's worth it. I highly recommend these!
My infant has had colic problems since day 1 it seems. For a few weeks we tried everything we could to try to make things better for him. He would cry and scream while wiggling trying to get rid of the gas bubbles. I bought these because of the reviews and am very glad I did. The day we started using these, he was like a different baby. I mean, yeah, it is annoying to wash soooooo many pieces and its very time consuming, however, it is very worth it! Recommend these to everyone!
I bought these on a recommendation from a Nurse in a child birthing class my husband and I went to.  I am so happy we have them!  It does exactly what it says... at least in my experience it does.  My daughter burps easily, and sometimes not at all (without any negative effects)... her spit up is minimized by the bottles and she does have colic.  So, anything that reduces the bubbles in her digestive tract are good in my book.I would recommend these to anyone looking to buy bottles for their newborn.  My daughter was small for her age, and at 6 weeks old we are still getting use out of them at 4oz.  :)
These bottles are great.  I've been using them for a month and my daughter is a pro.  She was born 5 weeks early and has had no difficulty with the flow of the regular sized nipples and she doesn't get confused since she is mainly breast fed.  The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is only because the bottles are somewhat annoying to clean by hand.  There are many parts to this system.  I do put them in the dishwasher, which makes things much easier, but you need a good supply of bottles then.
i am the mother of twins. I registed for the playtex ventaire bottles thinking they were the best bottles. I was very disapointed with them, my daughter would spill all the formula out of the sides of the bottles it was so difficult to feed her. Then a friend of mine suggested these bottles, they were a god send , I really believe they also helped her get rid of gas problems.. the only problem i have is they are hard to clean, but worth it....
I admit, I was extremly skeptical... my mother actually bought these for me b/c my preemie son was in pain all of the time from gas and the only thing that slightly helped was the Playtex Nursers, and he was still in pain a lot of times. We tried everything to help him. Then she brought me these.. and he has not had a problem since... My son is a happy baby again!!!! I am so happy with these. I read on here that cleaning them is a pain.. but that is just not so. I hand clean bottles anyways and it is so simple to clean these bottles, I can't believe that ppl are so lazy as to complain about a couple extra seconds to run a brush in 3 holes. Gimmie a break. I also clean a bunch of parts for my pump, so I just do it all at once. OH!!! And these bottles fit on my Medela pump, so I can just pump right in the bottle!!!! And we havent had any leaks, btw... these things are GREAT. Oh, and they also make a widemouth version that you can get at Babies R Us... just in case you prefer them.... I wish I had gotten these earlier.. my son is 7 weeks (he was born at 32 weeks, btw) and he is a different baby with these bottles.
I'm all about new and up dating, even though it's on 1 child, I like to research and know that it's the best or at least the close to it.  I tried the avent first, it's ok, but I'm not fond of the plain look.  I tried gerber, playtex and so on.  Then I bought some Dr. Brown.  It was ok for awhile then things starting getting messy. If you hate washing dishes, this ain't for ya! Now this bottle is very difficult.  It has so much things you have to assemble.  If you put just a tad more milk the lid will leak and it's not easy trying to wash that skinny tube.  (sigh)  And the nipple is soft and all but my baby needs to something that he can get a grip.  If you are looking for the best bottle or nipple, I recommend NAM.  They came out with a new bottle and nipple.  It has fun colors, very attractive, you can tell that the bottle is working from the air you hear coming out of the bottom suction and the awesome nipple that babies can actually get a grip on.  If I had ten hands I'd give it (10) thumbs up!
My baby who is just 3 weeks old was swallowing a lot of wind from his old bottles. I have found them on amazon with great prize. They really help with getting rid of extra air. My baby is having less air n he is not chocking at all because of perfect natural flow for newborn.. I am very happy with this item.
It might take you awhile to figure out how to take apart and put together the bottle but it works great! My son hardly spits up from it (only from over eating).  I have no problem with it leaking as long as the top is twisted on correctly.  I highly recommend them.
I bought these because I thought that I was going to start adding cereal to my son's milk, however then realized this was a no no. I know that many people out there do this and I'm sure this nipple would work out great, however I did not use this product after all.
I looked for spoons that I could take everywhere and didnt had to wrap on a napkin (annoying) and found this.  Read some reviews before buying it and I agree that one doesn't fit ...instead of placing the 8 of them, only 7 fit but that's not an issue as I dont use all in one day so I just leave one outside for next time.  Nice colors.  Will definitely recommend.
I haven't used the utensils as much since I had already bought other spoons.  I was looking for something to hold the spoons I had for daycare and travel.  They were fairly long spoons and this worked great!! Also nice to have all the extra utensils for when i run out.
This is the PERFECT way to store utensils for on the go.  Keeps them clean and contained.  Also is the perfect size to be refilled with the &#34;Take and Toss&#34; utensils readily found in stores!
I was initially hesitant to go with Evenflo, we had used Dr. Brown's with our first child (they were pre-BPA scare bottles so we trashed them).  I'm pleased to say that these nipples (and the glass bottles) work just fine and don't seem to give my little guy any trouble with air.  Highly recommended for a budget conscious family!
The only thing I wish was a little different about these is the shape. They are the same shape as the slow flow nipples, and I have to stare at the tops of them to try to decide if the hole is larger (making them fast flow). Otherwise, they work very well.
so far 3 months of use and still no problems: boil them or steralize in microwavable bags and still haven't had to replace any
So far my son doesnt have any issued with this nipple! they are very durable and doesnt cause any leakage! :)
I've had no issue with it yet. I just needed some nipples and locally the stores were to expensive and I didn't feel like traveling to target. Good stuff.
Ok, what can I say. Bought these for my niece and these are the nipples she decided to use. It is a personal choice.
The price was great. However these are very bad for compatibility, and they are very leaky. Even on Evenflow bottles these leaked liked crazy. I ended up throwing these away after two weeks trying to find the right combo that didn't drench my kids neck. I tried evenflow, medela, gerber, and parents choice bottles. LEAKED In all of them. This is a great price for nipples, and you  might think you should stockpile ( I did, I bought a dozen) but it's not worth it, you get what you pay for.  My choice for standard nipples is Playtex ventaire nipples. Since we began using those nipples NO LEAKS. In fact, we noticed no gas too, we switched to using almost allPlaytex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottles 9-Ounce, 3 Pack (Colors Vary)as our main bottle. The nipple ring is tight and the nipple is stiff, the bottle design prevents nipple collapse and makes airflow work in the perfect combo so that he never got a gassy tummy again. Spend the money, buy the good stuff.
We have a drama-queen in the house. She is 7 mo and she requires her milk to be given to her in Parent's choice bottles with Evenflo nipples... no idea why, but that is the only way she takes her milk; took us some time to figure this one out, but got there eventually. These can be sterilized in water in the microwave. They last well (we change all the nipples once every 2 months). They are reasonably soft, but last long enough. Good product.
These work great for the Evenflo bottles. Affordable and they fit well so the bottles vent but don't leak. My daughter had no issues with these nipples.
I have no complain about the product...but the baby just do not like it...she takes any pacifier bu not this one... donno why..
this was the perfect pacifier for my baby and the only one she could stand after trying more than 10 types.
My baby loves this pacifier!  We are exclusively breastfeeding (second baby) and I was looking for something that the baby would take.  I didn't want to introduce the pacifier too early, but broke down and gave him this one at 3 weeks, and we haven't had any trouble with &#34;nipple confusion.&#34; (I put it in parenthesis because some are questioning its existence.. ;) In any case, these pacifiers look &#34;old fashioned&#34; but they're actually very nice with a natural-shaped (not orthodontic) nipple.  They do not contour to the baby's lips and cheeks at all (which avoids red marks and rashes!) but stay in much better than the soothies, which babies often have trouble keeping in.  All in all, highly recommended, especially for a breastfed baby!
My son is breastfeeding and adapted to these nipples perfectly to sooth without any issues with nipple confusion. Very happy mom & baby!
Used for dolls, and these are as close to the vintage version that was very similar as I can find :)
My daughter has been taking these since she was born, shes now almost three and I just cant get rid of them like I wanted to. The nipples are round and wont start messing up on you after all that chewing and sucking.
Took one star off immediately even though I knew I could not pick colors.  Amazon could fix this if they wished.  I ordered two sets hoping to get one neutral color for my son.  I got yellow and pink.  The quality is good.  I will say we bought these for 2.99 and then saw them in our local Wal Mart for 2.78 in pink, blue, and yellow.  Still a good price here you may want to check your local Wal Mart though if you're concerned about colors.
I should have read the reviews  :(  REALLY need a choice of colors on this product so everyone doesn't end up with pink.  Lots of unhappy customers with boys.
These aren't the best nipples we purchased, but they're not the worst either. They work and do their job, but nothing special of them. They are not leak proof though so if you're looking for leak proof these are not it. Also, if you're one who puts cereal in the bottle (Something I don't recommend doing unless a doctor suggests it - just a personal opinion) the holes aren't big enough for that either.
Updated February 21, 2014:My kids are 5 now.  Reflecting back on all the products for babies that were placed on prominent shelves and highly advertised on the Internet, much of what we bought was unnecessary. Price signals in the baby product category don't seem that relevant in that expensive items were often not of better quality. The most important thing for parents of newborns is to try to get some babysitting help so they can sleep more and have some down time.  End of update.I had needed fast flow nipples for my twins.  These have fit the purpose well.  These nipples are also standard size (see below), silicone texture, and traditional round shaped.* Flow: nipples come in newborn, slow, medium and fast.* Standard vs. non-standard: It's important to get nipples that fit your bottles.  For example, Gerber and Medela have standard bottles.  Advent has some standard and some non-standard bottles.  Dr. Brown has non-standard bottles that only use Dr. Brown nipples.* Texture: soft latex, firmer silicone, and traditional rubber.* Shapes: traditional (round), orthodontic, and flat-topped.
My two month old tends to chicle on the milk when to much comes out of a regular nipple this doesn't take away the problem completely but reduces the occurrences
these nipples are so small that they just fall through a regular size bottle!!!  What is the point of them I do not know.  Would have returned but not worth even worrying with so I just threw them away!!  If you get them make sure you have the same brand of bottles and all the other parts.
great product allways with the quality of gerber, my wife and my baby loves it, and unbeatable price, highly recommended, buy together with the first essential bottles and a color nipples availables too
Gerber First Essential Silicone BPA Free Nipples, Slow Flow, 6 PackCalidad del producto excelente.Costo del producto acorde la calidad,Tiempo de entrega conforme lo establecido.Embalaje conforme el producto.Recomendado para los bebes de la casa, por excelente calidad, econom&iacute;a y utilidad
Good quality nipples.  Silicone is not thin as the others we have tried.  Price I paid is about right.  My kids are not complaining.Made in USA.
These are great replacement nipples for the Gerber Essential Bottles. Since the 9oz bottles come with the medium flow nipple, I need to get fast flow replacements when my baby turned about 6 months old. This was a great deal, cheaper than in the local store and since I am a Prime member free shipping.
... these are pretty good.  I bought them to replace medium-flow Evenflo nipples.  I'd give them more stars for seeming durability and accurately described as "fast flow," but fewer stars because the base circumference SEEMS to be smaller around than the other nipples.  I get considerably more leakage around the edges than I did with the Evenflo, others.  We just shake the bottles with a paper towel around the top... weird, but it does the trick alright.  I'd probably buy them again if they were $1, but with the leaks, a few cents more for another brand is probably best.
I love being able to have these accessories dispocision.
I bought these as extras in case I lose some as my son gets older.
We have used avent bottle for all 4 of children and always seem to loose the lids. These work just as expected. My kids also seem to grab them to use as small snack cups and to grab small drinks.
I really love those caps,it came out so much handy and easy to clean .Highly recommend.Two thumbs up for all Avent products!!!
I bought these to use for my klean kanteens that have the sippy adaptor and they fit perfectly. The only drawback is that they are very easy to lose. The sippy spouts used to get covered with dust, lint, etc., but with these caps that's no longer an issue. Sometimes I notice condensation inside so they do have to be cleaned regularly to prevent any mildew/mold from growing there. But overall they work great for the price.
I got this in hopes of using it to keep the kitchen drawer open so that my baby could play and not pinch her fingers... It works!!  I open the drawer and put it on the back corner and when she pushes on it to stand it wedges into the corner and makes the drawer stay open.  Love it!
Love it! I don't have to worry about pinched fingers anymore. We put it in top if the door and you don't even notice it's there.
I have a set of double doors going into the media room. The door monkey won't work on those. This foam piece s perfect. The doors won't shut, no pinched fingers.
I actually use this to keep the door open to the room where we keep the cat's litter box. Its a subtle product and keep guests from closing the door.
My oldest son got his finger caught in a door jam at school, after spending time in the ER we were not going to let it happen again. This works great to protect from pinches, but will do nothing if your child veers toward the space hinge side.
I have been using Playtex Bottles with liners since my second child was born. I must say I loved the drop-ins until the expandable drop-ins came out. When my 3rd child started using 8 oz, I started searching for an alternative. I stumbled across these on Amazon and after some quick math, realized that these liners priced at $5.99/free shipping for 140 liners were the absolute cheapest liners you could get. So I had to try them. My aunts assured me that they were all that they used with their children and it wasn't that bad. They really aren't bad. In fact, there are some things I like better about them. I love that if you squeeze the air out of these that there is no chance of the liner popping off the ring and milk going everywhere. I love the more compact packaging and that the liners can be pulled easily out of the carton when needed. They do only go to 8 oz but I have never had a baby to take more than 8 oz at one time. The only flaw I can find is that it does take a few extra seconds to get the liner in the bottle than a drop-in but for the perks I will live with it.
nice product but just as easy to buy the generic store brand at a cheaper price.
These inserts certainly work, but I will say that it takes longer to install them than the Drop-ins variety.  I've not had any trouble with the Drop-ins leaking like some other reviewers (yet!!).  I can see they will be easier to travel with since they are flat (as opposed to the drop ins which are round).  I think I will keep both varieties on hand since they serve different functions.
Great product! I'm so happy with this one...I originally bought the "Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock" which was a good idea but poorly executed. With the Safety 1st it's adjustable with the twist of a knob! The problem I had with the Mommy's helper was that it was way too big and left too much space for the door to open and eventually pinch little fingers. I would hands down recommend this product for anyone whos trying to keep little rug rats out of bi-fold doors!
These go on in two seconds, and are easy to slide over or remove.  They are very effective, and don't scratch the wood.
We tried several different bi-fold locks before finally finding this one that works.  It seems a little flimsy at first, but it does its job.  If you are unable to reach the top of your closet doors easily though, this product will get annoying quick.  I can reach ours, but barely.  We first tried to put them on the bottom of the doors, which worked just fine until our 1 year old figured out how to work them (after 1 day!).  I'm just glad his socks and shoes aren't scattered all over his room now...
I was a little disappointed when we received these, as they're rather difficult to move (especially for a short person)!  I need something for a pantry and coat closet, however, going into those areas several times a day has become tedious.  I intend to try some other options.
We had to remove the inside bracket to get these to fit our bi-fold doors. The fit is now a bit loose but the lock does what we want it to do, keeps the kids out!
We have been quite happy with the warmer until last week. We plugged it in and 5 seconds later it was smoking and burning at the car adapter outlet. My husband right away pulled out the burning plug but it already melted and a metal piece of it stayed int the outlet causing an electric short. So we were not able to restart our car until it was removed by a mechanic. Save yourself the experience of standing on the side of the road with a hungry baby on a rainy day due to this product.
It takes 20-30 minutes to warm a 6-8 oz bottle so you need to aniticipate feeding times. It heats the bottle to lukewarm, but that's as hot as you should want it anyway. Also it helps to speed it up if you remove it a couple of times and shake the bottle to cycle the milk around. Otherwise you could have scalding hot milk on the outside and ice cold in the middle. Bottles that have bottoms that curve inward don't press the sensor to heat. I managed to stack some coins between the sensor and the bottle and this fixed the probably. Even with the minor problems I found it useful to have on car trips.
If you are planning even one long trip with your new little one, you'll be glad you have this, but try it out before you go.  It does take a long time to warm up a bottle with this, so you do have to anticipate the need for a bottle.  The smaller the bottle, the faster the formula will warm up.  It's a good idea to try it out before you travel so you know how long it will take.  One use will pay for itself!
Our son loves us stacking them down across the room, crawling over to them and knocking them down. I feel like he could do this all day. Another plus is being able to take them into his inflatable tub so he can play with them while we give him his bath and he loves watching the water come out the little holes in the bottom of each one. Cute little toy for him to play with.
These are great stacking cups!  Especially for the price!  There are tiny holes in the bottom to allow fluids, etc. escape.
Our son plays with these all the time in our bath tub.  At his grandmas, he plays with them as regular toys... he loves to "throw" them and chase them around her hard wood floors.  Highly recommended!
I remember my grandma having stacking cups like these at her house when I was little. When I had my daughter who is now 9 years old, we would go over there and she would play with the same stacking cups. No matter what other fancy toys were around she went to the cups first to play with. I saw these on Amazon and had to order them for my little son. They are a great little set of cups. They nest inside each other or stack when turned upside down. They also have numbers 1-8 printed on the bottom. Each cup has holes in the bottom, the number of holes corresponds to what number the cup is. For example the #1 cup has one small heart hole, #4 has 4 small squares and the #8 has 8 small circle holes. That&#8217;s a nice little addition to them.I am marking them down a star for either not being BPA free or not listing they are BPA free. I checked the tag and there&#8217;s nothing on there about BPA. I will not be letting my son put these in his mouth and shame on the company for not making BPA free products. My only other very tiny gripe is there are 2 yellow cups, it would be nice if there were no repeating colors. That&#8217;s definitely not a big deal, but it seems like they could&#8217;ve done a dark purple or teal or something other than repeating a color. There are two picutres on the Amazon page of cups that are 2 different color schemes. The set we received is: yellow, pink, light blue, dark blue, green, yellow, orange and purple. Other than those two issues, this is a very simple and enjoyable toy.
This set is used so much by my kids.  The sizes and weight are great.  The colors are a little unusual - not useful in a pattern and not standard primary colors -but no problem, really.  I found these at Kohl's for a similar price, but I could not find anything similar to this at other retail stores around me.  I think this is a perfect baby shower gift!
My 8 month old absolutely loves these cups. This seems to be his favorite toy. He is too young to stack them but he loves watching me stack them and then knocking them over. He also loves banging them together, banging them on other things, dumping them out of a bucket, pulling them apart (when nested inside each other), chewing on them, and playing with them in the bath. I love that they compactly nest inside each other so they are easy to bring along in a diaper bag. I recently brought these to a baby play group and all the other babies dropped their toys and picked up these cups and started playing with them instead! They are so simple, but really the ultimate baby toy.Note: the colors are different than the ones pictured.
I cannot tell you how many hours a day my baby sits on the floor and plays with these cups.  These were a last minute stocking stuffer and i'm so glad i bought these!!!  Even taking 1 or 2 of these to the Dr.s office or to play with while we eat dinner....just 2 is entertainment enough!  These are a MUST for the toy collection.  These are also good bathtime toys.
For a toy that is supposed to stack up, these cups are very hard to stack and don't stay stacked up.  Can't get my mind around a stack-up toy that a child cannot stack.
Baby loves to nest and stack and throw these cups.  He likes to put other toys in them and dump them out.  These are a dry toy for us, but note that the bottoms all have little cutouts to drain and won't hold water very well for tubby play.  I have a set for the diaper bag, and can pull them out for play or to hold dry snacks.  Great value.  Only downside is there is no strap to keep them all together in a bag or toy box, so i use a fat rubber band.  Hold up fine in the dishwasher.
My daughter loves playing with (and chewing on) these when she plays with her toys on the floor, but she likes plaing with them in the bath even more. It doesn't say so in the product description, but each cup has holes in the bottom (the same number of holes as the number on the cup, and each cup has differently-shaped holes--e.g., seven stars, 6 squares, etc.), so in the bath my daughter can fill these with water and watch the water come out the holes in little waterfalls. She LOVES this, and it'll keep her busy for a long time. She also uses them in her wading pool to the same effect. Great product!
Great toy! The cups are durable, the colors are nicer than shown online, and they stack well. This is one of my daughter's favorite toys.
Love these.... different colors, the bottoms have a number on them and the holes match the number when possible (3 is a triangle, four is a square, etc...) also, the number of holes matches the number on the cup... this toys will grow with my LO and has a small enough footprint that it can travel with us easily!
They stack inside of each other and also stack as a tower.They have holes in the bottom to prevent suction.  The number of holes and the shape side counts match the numbers on the cups.  So 3 has three triangle holes, 4 has four square holes, etc.
My daughter loves these cups! She plays with them at bath time, in her playpen, when eating, and in the car.
This simple and inexpensive toy is still going strong after a lot of play logged in.  It doesn't seem to get old.  Get this.
I wanted to buy the Green Sprouts stacking cups but Amazon offered them w/ free shipping one day and then the next it would be sold by a different vendor without the free shipping.  When I saw these stacking cups in the baby store, I put them on my registry instead because they were made w/ safer plastic like the Green Sprouts toys.The label on the learning curve stackers and other products indicate: no PVC, no bpa, and no Phthalates....it's important to me that we have as many safe toys as possible for our baby so I was thrilled to find these.I like this stacking toy because the cups fit nicely in one another and have enough of an edge that they stack nicely on top of one another. They also have tiny holes in the bottom of the cups - each in a different shape as well as numbers on the bottom too.Our daughter is 6 1/2 months old and I put a few of the cups out on the blanket for her to clutch and play with during belly time as well as other toys. Last night she had a cup in each hand and was waving them around. I know she'll like to play with them as she gets older and was glad she already showed an interest in them at this time too.
I don't care what brand you get or where you get the stacking cups, just buy them.  They are worth whatever you have to dole out.  My daughter has played with them since she was at least 2 months old.  She's 18 months now and she still plays with them.  We have stacking cups for her bath time, too, and she plays with those forever.  The awesome thing is that they travel easily.  I would have these bought even before baby is born because they're good to have on stand-by.  They're amongst the best baby toys ever.
This is a fantastic toy, there are so many games to play with this. I teach my baby sequence of large to small, 1 to 8, 8 to 1, different colors, and it shows them cause and effect too, when they push the finished stack, everything comes down and at first they are surprised but then they quickly learn that it is what happens when you push a stack of cups down. Every time i stack the cups my little one looks at the cups being stacked very intently. The great thing is it takes up easily half an hour playing.
These are great.  Your child can play with them in so many different ways.  An added bonus: they can be used to teach counting and colors!
These cups keep my little guy busy for a long time! I will say I thought the cups would be a little bigger. They are quite small
We mostly use these in the bath, my son is 6 months now but we have had them since he was born. When he was first born we just used them as a cup for washing but now he grabs all of them and bash them together and splash water everywhere and tries to drink out of them. They are fun out of the bath too, though! :0) love them!
The cups are just slightly smaller than I was expecting but they are a great size for my 6 month old. I know my little boy will enjoy playing with these during bath time now
BEST TOY EVER!!! Seriously, it's so so simple but so loved. My two year old has a ton of toys but will still dig to the bottom of the toy box daily just for this set. He loves building a tower with them or nesting them. He likes pretending to drink out of them. And he loves seeing if his other toys will fit in them. Our Little People Farmer is commonly seen hanging out in one of the cups. ;) They've been the #1 toy in our playroom for well over a year now.
These cups are wonderful for a little one, they stack easily and nicely and fun to topple over. The colors that are pictured here are not what I received, I actually got two cups that were the same color, but thats okay for me.Pros:- The size is perfect, you can't really go wrong with stacking toys.- Each block has a number on the bottom and with the number is a coordinating hole. The holes are different shapes too, which I love.- They are perfect for the tub- Easily fit in your purse for an extra toy at a restaurantHonestly, I have nothing negative to say about these, they are constantly being tossed around, stacked and knocked together.
My 1 year old son plays with the cups everyday. He drinks from them imaginary drinks and cheers with our glasses.It is great toy to help baby learn how to stack objects, place them inside, learn colors and numbers.It is well made, there's no sharp corners and my only wish is that it could be 10 cups for full counting 1 to 10.
The cups are stackable and come with numbers on the bottom.  Medium weight plastic.  they have slits in the bottom.  so simple but my baby (6 mo) LOVES these!
So, the cups have a recycle code #7 which is listed as not safe, I called the company are they reassured me that it is (??). My guess is that it's not safe to use plastics with code #7 to warm up maybe? Not sure. I am not really excited abt these cups, as other reviewers said, they do not stack up very well but that's not a major issue to me ... My issue is that code #7 which was only indicated on the plastic wrapper, not the cups themselves so it's easily missed...
It's just a bunch of plastic cups and yet my baby loves these. She plays with them every day and doesn't seem to tire of them unlike her other toys.  She doesn't stack them - and I agree with others who have said that they're not that easy to stack - the grooves in the cups could be cut deeper so the cups fit better.  But she loves to knock them down when I stack them or take two of them and bang them together.  I looked at a lot of different stacking toys but there aren't any really great ones out there so this one does the job.
My daughter really loves these stacking cups. She can easily stack up and nest them with ease and they can be played with both in and out of water. I love them because they are super sturdy, can be washed when needed, take up little space, and are bright. But most importantly, I love these stacking cups because my child can actually stack them without them tipping over, unless she wants them to. Some stacking cups are not steady and it causes toddlers great frustration when they are trying to stack a tower and it falls midway. The First Years Stack N Count Cups are really one of the best stacking cups out there and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a simple toy that will provide multiple options of play and will last for many years to come!
They're smaller than I expected, but it makes it easy for baby to pick up. Each cup has a number on the bottom and a set of holes that correspond with that number making it perfect for bath time too. A great, simple toy to practise stacking, counting, size (big and small), and colours.
My preemie is 12 mos corrected age and loves these!  The bright colors and relatively small size of the cups make these ideal for small hands.  Definitely recommend these.
I have given this a 4 start rating only because they are quite small in size and are difficult for little fingers to stack. The difference between sizes is very small, hence little ones cant really differentiate between sizes. I ordered it when my son was 16 months, now 18. But they never got used as stacking cups. But they are being used as bath toys now. They have little holes and my son loves to squish water around. The quality of plastic is good. I would at the same time not recommend it for the stacking purpose.
My 10 month old seriously plays with these more than any other toy.  They are great in the pool (they float) and indoors.  You can work on colors and teaching baby how to stack the cups.  I don't know why they are so much more entertaining than expensive toys with bells and whistles, but they are.
This is great for many ages. Stacking, knocking down, putting things inside, taking apart, banging. They have different shapes holes in the bottom to make &#34;fountains&#34; in the tub. Equally fun from 6 months to 5 years old.
We were very surprised that such a simple and inexpensive toy would be used for so long by my son when he was a baby.  And now we got them out for a new baby he still enjoys playing with them at almost 3 years old.  My mother has some and says my niece loved playing with them at 5 years old.
I bought this when my daughter was 6 months old and its one of our favorite toys! She enjoys banging it around, looking at the bright colors and finds different ways to play with it. Now at 14 months she is trying to stack them and put one inside the other. Very good buy!
great smaller size stacking cups
My son loves to tear down the towers, pound the cups on the floor and chase the cat with them.  Great for travel as you can do lots with them and they don't take up too much space.
I picked these up on sale, and was not expecting much from them.Turns out my son loves them and I do too. They are portable (easily fit into a bag), quiet, don't break when thrown on the floor, and still hold his interest after months of owning them.Amazing how something so simple can be so entertaining.
I bought these for my great-grandson who is almost one year old.  They are sturdy and colorful.  He is learning how things stack and loves to put them together and take them apart.  They are one of his favorite toys.  He carries them all over the place and likes to play with them in the water because they have holes on the bottom that they water pours out of.  Happy I bought them.
My 1 year old loves these "stackers,"  He plays with them each and every day for long periods.  He nests them inside one another and inside out and stacked up.  He likes to clank them together as well.  They are BPA free and the colors (although not as pictured) are nice and bright.  These are fabulous, I have 4 kids and I have purchased a few sets now.  My original set from the 90's still looks like new.  I put mine in the dishwasher on the top rack and they clean up very well.
My 22 month old just greeted me with a handful of these outlet covers. Sigh. I am so disappointed by this product. I should have bought the cheaper ones that are really hard to remove. Don't buy.
at first i liked these because they were easy to take out.  unfortunately, my toddler thought so too.  the only outlet option that i've found works are the plate covers.  the make it so the outlet is accessible to me, but not my son.
My 15 month old has no problem taking these out. His interest has been drawn to them now and they are very ineffective.
Here's the deal: there are lots of bottles out there that claim to reduce/eliminate gas from being ingested during feeding. Some work by letting air in from various places (avent-around the threads of the collar, playtex-through tiny perforations in the base), others work by not letting air in at all, but collapsing the container instead (playtex liners...etc). The problem with venting the air through the collar is that it ends up bubbling up and mixing with the formula. The problem with venting through the base is that it requires a bit of force to get the air to go through the perforations - so the bottle builds up negative pressure that resists your baby's sucking. This is the same issue with the collapsible liner bottles - the resistance becomes stronger as the baby finishes the bottle and collapses the liner.Dr. Browns are the only ones that do not mix air with the formula and at the same time do not create any resistance to sucking. This is accomplished by maintaining an open, unobstructed airway to the formula. The tradeoff here is that the bottle will leak if inverted for any period of time or shaken vigorously. I'd say this is a small inconvenience. I guess that the end of the day you don't buy these purely for convenience - you buy them because they're the best for your baby's feeding. Our child was very colicy during her first 3 months. We tried avent, playtex, and others. We got a few Dr browns free at a baby show, and have purchased and used them exclusively since.ps: We were first skeptical with all the parts, but these all wash easily with some creative placement in the dishwasher.
These 8 oz bottles are fantastic.  Yes, you will still need to burp your baby, but they will burp easily and fast without any stomach aches.  I originally bought the 4oz bottles, but quickly ran to the store for the 8 ounce bottles because it does not take more than 6 wks before you are feeding more than 4 ounces. Refrigerate what baby does not finish and don't worry about fixing so many bottles.
Defintely helped our spitup.  My daughter did not like the standadr nipples.  My advice is (if this is not your baby's first bottle)whatever nipple you baby is first exposed to try to get the clostest nipple to it.  My daughter did much better with the wide neck bottles.  A little time consuming to clean, but worth it if it helps.  I also would highly recommend you consider the playtex premium nurser bottles in which you squeeze all the air out of the liner before feeding your baby.  Dr. Browns and the Playtex Nursers are the best bottles on the market.
My baby is a little over a month old.  I had heard positive reviews of Avent products so I went with their bottles.  My baby was having terrible gas.  I decided to try the Dr. Brown's bottles and what a difference it has made!  My baby is SIGNIFICANTLY less gassy.  Yes, the extra parts are a pain to clean but it's definitely worth it.
Ofcourse I havent started using these bottles just yet but I have always wanted Dr. brown's bottles so when I saw them at such a great price I had to buy. I like the sturdiness of the bottles.
OK..so they're more expensive than most of the bottles out there--However, I LOVE them and my baby thanks me for it!  I did notice that after I started using these bottles, my baby was MUCH more happy and had less gas and spit up than he usually had.  I used those Vent-Aire garbage bottles and my son was not a HAPPY camper with them... he'd literally sweat trying to eat from them...and would take him 45 minutes or more to eat 6oz--EVEN AFTER I'd try and make the nipple hole(s) bigger.  Needless to say, with Dr. Brown's bottles, he no longer strains nor sweats when he eats!!  2 drawbacks...(1)they're a pain to clean, and YOU MUST clean the inside chamber!, and  (2) you must take off the nipple before heating in a microwave, else it will leak
I have a four month old son and unfortunately, just discovered this bottle a month ago.  I saw them in the store while doing my shower registry and quite honestly, they looked too complicated so I didn't put them on my list...BIG mistake!I tried several other brands of bottles and this is by far the best.  It does everything it claims to do as far as eliminating gas and spit-up.It isn't complicated at all and isn't anymore difficult to wash than the other bottle types.  I found the slimmer design is easier for me to handle, but I would think the size of the bottle wouldn't matter as far as performance.If my husband would let me restock my bottle supply (18) with Dr. Brown's, I would be one happy lady, but that isn't going to happen!Don't make the same mistake I did, buy Dr. Brown's from the start...you won't regret it!!
Before My baby arrived I did all my research for the best bottles & these bottles were my one & only choice.  NO GAS at all.  Never fussy  or anything.  You can actually  see how there is no air being sucked as the baby eats.  We used wide necks when we started supplimenting but after I saw that he was swallowing little bit of air through the sides because the nipple was too big for his little mouth to fit around we quickly switched to these which are even better. I've read some posts here with moms complaining that  the bottles leak -NEVER HAD THAT PROBLEM.  takes longer to wash- BIG DEAL...EITHER THROW THEM IN THE DISHWASHER OR like me, washing them by hand which takes 1 min longer BUT your baby is happy & Gas free.  I highly recommend these bottles over any other ones out there.
Based on reviews from mommies I know and this website, I went with Dr. Brown's bottles right from the start.  I am very happy that I did! The bottles are designed to help your baby eat calmly and slowly.  This is terrific for my little monster who often approaches the bottle like she would gobble it up whole if she could!  The Dr. Brown's bottle slows her down and she eats safely and comfortably.  She has always taken a full feeding, and she has almost no gas or spit-up.  In fact, we really have to work to get a burp out of her!  She is very healthy and content, and this is the most important factor in choosing a bottle.  It's certainly outwieghs the fact that they are a little bothersome to clean.  I am currently hand-washing them.  I do 8 at a time and have my bottles for the next 24-hour period.  I may look into a dishwasher basket, but I want to make sure they will get as clean as when I wash them.I've had no problem with leakage or anything, and I don't why some people have...? I've been nothing but pleased with these bottles.  They will be our choice from start to finish!
These are great bottles!My baby is breastfed and we started using these bottles for my husband to feed our baby pumped breast milk when he was five weeks old and did not have any trouble with nipple confusion. He took the bottle right away without a complaint and it has never interfered with nursing. I pump and my husband feeds him a bottle for his late night feeding and they do great! We used the "preemie" nipples so that the flow was not too fast and he had to work at sucking like he would at the breast. Since then we have upgrades to the size 1 nipples.I have never had a problem with bubbles and my baby rarely has to burp. The bottles seem like a good quality. It takes a bit more effort to clean, but isn't too difficult.
Both bottles do a fine job of keeping bubbles out of your baby.  We tried and used both bottles with our boy.  The real deal between the two is the nipple.  The nipple on Avent bottles are larger at the base and firmer than the Brown bottles.  When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles.  He just couldn't get comfortable around the nipple.  We switched to Dr. Bown's and he took to it with little problem.  As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents.  Why did we switch?  Cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles SUCKS!  There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles.  Plus, the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just don't seem to pack away as well.  However, if your baby is picky there isn't much you can do.  For expecting parents, I would not recommend buying a bunch of one type over the other.  Buy one of each first and see which one you baby is comfortable with.  Only 4 stars because of the cleaning issues.
We just found these bottles and couldn't be happier! My 4-month old can't use Avent at all, does better with Playtex Ventaire, but is most comfortable with these. He eats easily, without spitting up, he doesn't have to stop every few swallows to rest like he does with other bottles. I do think every baby has different bottle needs though. My daughter used Playtex Ventaire and did wonderfully with them (we didn't know about Dr. Browns bottles then), but my son really has to have the Dr. Browns. My only complaint is that the narrow 8-oz bottles are too tall for my diaper bag. I need to get the wide-mouth bottles and they should fit better. But, these are excellent bottles.
There's a reason so many people give these bottles 5 stars ! My baby girl had colic and gas from day one and was up all night crying until my mother heard about Dr. Brown's bottles and urged me to try them. The colic/gas stopped on the very first day I used them, words cannot describe that feeling. I do recommend skipping the purchase of the 4 oz. bottles and going staight to the 8 oz. ones to save some $$, just don't fill them all the way up until necessary, they sell extra nipples in various levels. And as for the other reviews complaining that they leak and are hard to clean and expensive: if you assemble them correctly and do not overfill, they won't leak, and the 2 extra parts are WELL WORTH the extra time to clean, but they are not "hard" to clean, I soak in hot soapy water and rinse, rarely do I have to use the brush thing, and they are really no more expensive than other bottles, well worth it and plus you can save by just using these instead of trying all the others. TRUST ME DR. BROWN'S ARE FABULOUS !! I have been using them for 2 months now and I am so happy I agreed to try them. Among the others that I had previously tried were the Avent and Playtex VentAire bottles but Dr. Brown's were the only "anti-colic" bottles that worked. Please do read and follow the directions though, i think some of the negative reviews are the results of not properly using the bottles and following instructions.
Unfortunately, I was suckered in to all the hype about the Dr. Brown's bottles.  I used them for 5 months and finally got so fed up with all of the problems that I bought all new bottles.  The biggest problem I noticed was that they leaked after I had them in the cooler if we went out.  I never filled them past the line, but they ALWAYS LEAKED when they were cold.  They leaked standing upright or laying down.  I'm a nursing mother and it killed me to watch my milk leaking from those bottles all the time.  It was such a waste and my daughter would get milk all over her chin and neck.  Cleaning the bottles was also a big pain.  I really do not reccomend these bottles.  I gave them to a friend who wanted to try them out.  I'm much happier with the Playtex nurser bottles with the drop ins.  They have never leaked and I'm not afraid to look in the bottle bag anymore when we are out!!
I must say these are truly worth buying! My baby had trouble drinking from nipples when she was born and we literally tried EVERY bottle/nipple out there. She would dribble and choke on the formula. Then my doctor finally suggested we try the Dr. Brown's bottles. We tried them and the baby did great. She finally drank the formula fine, with no problems. Also, she no longer had any gas! Also...don't bother getting the 4 oz. bottles....the 8 oz. are all you need. Babies don't drink only 4 oz. for very long. These bottles were like a miracle.  I recommend them to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!
This product did seem to help aleviate my baby's spit ups and gas, when compared to other bottles that would make my baby vomit. Just be ready to spend the extra time washing all the little parts that are inside!
I actually tried many bottles before I splurged and bought these.I spent alot of money on the Avent bottles because they were supposed to be the closest to the breast. I nursed my twins for about 4 1/2 months, so I thought the Avent would be the best. However, they leaked and formula would actually squirt from the sides of my boys mouth.I tried the Dr. Browns, and my boys took right to them. They would finish a bottle in about 1/2 the time and no more caving in nipples or leaks. They do still tend to spit up and have alot of gas from the other end, so I'm not sure about how much gas these bottles actually reduce.They are rather time consuming to clean because of all the parts. And I do wish they made handles to attach so it would be easier for my boys to learn to hold their bottles.These are still by far my boys favorite bottle.
These are the best bottles ever and the only ones we'll use.  Cleaning them can be a pain because of all the parts, but they are well worth it. We have them in 4 ounce size and the fat 8 ounce size and they are all perfect.
I purchased Dr. Brown's bottles for my daughter. The idea behind the vent is great but what a pain to put together! With a very fussy newborn, I did not have time to waste assembling the bottle. We discovered that Evenflo and Avent bottles work just as well and are cheaper.
I ordered this online because I couldn't find it in the stores and it arrived without a working motor. This is the 2nd baby food processor of two different brands where I've had trouble with the motors. I decided to use a manual food mill instead (which can be ordered from Amazon.com) and has pretty good reviews, too.
O produto &eacute; pr&aacute;tico e do tamanho ideal para preparar as refeies do beb. Facilita bastante nas viagens onde vc mesmo pode preparar as refeies de seu filho.
This toy box is everything I was hoping for. Its roomy, light weight and easy to assemble. Also I love that the top doesn't just slam shut, that way when my daughter puts her toys away she won't smash her fingers.
Nice construction/hinge. A couple of scratches, but not worth sending back for. A previous review said the Walnut color was more cherry. I wanted more cherry so I ordered the Walnut. Walnut IS dark Walnut, not a cherry color (fyi).
I ordered this through Amazon and recieved it quickly (thank you Prime shipping!) but we were missing one of the hinges to put it together.  All of the paperwork that came with it said NOT to contact Amazon for replacement parts but to instead contact the company directly.  I went to their website and there was a page dedicated solely to ordering replacement parts.  (Makes me think it happens quite a bit?!)  I filled out the necessary information, found the piece that I needed to order and within two days it arrived at my door free of charge.  Excellent!  The only bummer is that the original hinge that came with the toy box was bronze and the spare that they sent me in the mail was silver.  Not a big deal since the hinges are located inside the box, but still.  Overall I love the box - we got it for our 18-month-old to hold the toys in his room.  It's perfect because it won't slam his fingers (the lid stops in any position) and it's big enough to hold all of his obnoxiously large toys without taking up too much space in his room or being too big for him to get things out of.  I would've given it 5 starts had it come with all of the correct pieces right off the bat and will probably be buying one for our baby once he's in need of his own toy box as well!
This toy box ended up being a perfect match for our living room. I like that I can just throw all his toys in, close the lid, and you can't tell it's a toy box! The lid has a special hinge that doesn't allow the lid to slam, so my son (now 17mo old) can open and close it and I never have to worry about him smashing his finger. The lid is also strong, my husband has sat on it a few times and it shows no signs of wear. Excellent product.
Was easy for my husband to assemble and was in good shape when it arrived which really surprised us because a lot of packages coming overseas to APO get damaged.  Fit all of our two year olds toys.  We will definitely need to get another one when the second comes.  Our son closes the lid and climbs on top of it all the time.  He even jumps on it.  Now we don't accept this behavior, but the chest is proving to hold up just fine.
I just love to use those for my pumped breast milk. Never had any issues. I was told that Target brand fit drop-in bottles, but I never tried it. I think the price for original (Playtex) liners are just fine.
We love these liners and bottles. It was great since our daughter was very gassy when using other bottles but with these we would push up as much air as we could and we feel it helped to reduce the air she sucked in.
I've used these since I went back to work and they work great for me, baby, and my mother-in-law.I used to pump directly into the liners using this system:Playtex Drop Ins System Breast StorageNow I pump directly into the Medela bottles but I still transfer the milk to the liners using the adapter rings when I give the milk to my MIL everyday.Easy to store, cheaper than storage bags, and we've never had an issue with leaking.Sometimes the lines showing the ounces can be difficult for my MIL to read and they don't correspond to the ounce labels on the bottle when you use the adapter rings so I mark them with a sharpie. Works just fine for us!
I used these with my first son. You can sit the bottle in a cup of hot water and it warms up quickly. I also like that you can squeeze the air out of the bottle and save your little one's tummy. I have had some occasions where the liner leaked around the seal. You have to be careful that you don't kink the liner when screwing on the nipple and make sure it is tight before squeezing the air out. This was not a big enough issue to cause me to quit using them. I used these bottles until he was a year old. I have also found that some of the generic brand liners work just fine too.
I exclusively pump, and I love using Playtex nursers for my daughter. I use the &#34;hot water in a glass&#34; method for heating the milk, and since the liner is thin, it doesn't take a lot of time. They are effective in keeping out the tiny air bubbles many bottles create. The price in Amazon is much less than that in stores, even Wal-Mart. I will keep ordering!
Great for doing faux formula for 'reborn' realistic baby dolls (hugely popular dolls that are extremely real, and some artists get thousands of dollars if they can recreate the minute realistic details of babies' skin; I've heard of some selling for $17,000.00).  These will work when I double line the bottles, seal the holes in the nipple, and adhere the collar to the bottle's 'body'.  Collectors want realism&#8230;.nothing more real than the stuff used for actual babies :)
I love it. It is convenient, clean and a time saver. Especially for a working mom, I highly recommend this. Amazon price is cheaper than babiesus even with 20% coupon.
Love these liners--quick prep, easy feeding and makes bottle clean up a breeze, especially if you forget a bottle in the car or find one under the bed from a late night half awake feeding--you don't have to throw the bottle away because of the yuck.
I originally bought dr. brown bottles before the baby was born but at the hospital I had a hard time getting the baby to latch on - the lactation consultant suggested playtex nurser bottles because the nipple is very much shaped like the breast. My baby has had no problem going from breast to bottle (we do both) -- and having a liner makes cleaning the bottles super easy. I recommend these bottles to everyone and gave my sister dr. brown's (who prefers the dr. browns). I wish I knew about these before birth and not spent so much money on the dr. browns.
I love this system, I feel that it's really worth it. Though I don't use as many as some because I mostly breastfeed and use these for pumped milk, they really do make life easier, and for us they last a long time, since we may only use one or two a day, so it works to about $6 for 2 months, which I think is a small price for a little extra help.
These look so cute in my nephews room. These go with the Jungle Babies theme. So cute and great quality
By themselves they don't look like much.  I purchased the whole ensemble and the babies room looks great. If you go for the jungle babies, be sure that all pieces match..  We had to return the lamp and lamp shade because the characters were different than the rest of the ensemble.  Overall it looks great for a boys room
I love these wall hangings.  They are durable and look great with my jungle decor.  I did not get anything from the matching set...I just added them to what I already had and they really bring the room together.  Also, my son (10 weeks old) loves to stare at them.
so much safer than the matts, and if the baby falls shes hits the soft sides. Keeps all of her toys around her as well so she is constantly occupied.
I have the original safer bather and I'm thinking about purchasing this item and the reviews so far have been very helpful, however I have a few questions I'm hoping other reviewers can answer who own this:1. the original is more of a cushion and the material mildews after a while, do the beads in this one do the same or is it a different material?2. how long does it take to dry?3. at what age would you recommend this product? would it be appropriate for a 3 1/2 month old who can't sit on his/her own?
I thought this insert was a great idea, but it seemed to scare my 10-month old. She cried hysterically the second I put her in it the first time. The second time she cried the entire time despite my taking the time to show it to her and let her touch it, etc, before getting into the tub. same thing on night 3, so I returned it. Granted, this is just our experience, but I will say that I think part of the issue was she couldn't splash in it. As others have said, despite the manufacturers image, this tub doesn't really fill up with water - it pretty much soaks back through to the main tub. Also, I did rinse it off and hang it to dry, and after three uses it already had that 'sour' smell.
Great for my daughter who has used this since she was about 6 months old.  She is 9 months old now and we'll likely be using it for another couple of months until she is more stable in the tub.  It does take awhile to dry out though so we blow a fan on it at night to prevent it from getting moldy in the bathroom.
This tub is great! Soft material. Bright colors kept my son engaged during his bath. Fits perfectly inside our standard size tub. Air dries quickly when hung up. Arrived fast, too- 3 days after placing order!
So I like this product overall but I do have one problem with it and its kind of a big one. If you forget to hang it up to dry after bath time... IT SMELLS! It has only happened a couple times but now I feel like the dirty smell came from mildew settling into the bath stuffing and so it must be ruined inside, i just cant see it.... Threw it away and went with a blow up bath I can see, clean, and sanitize.
This is a great tub when they grow out of the infant tub but can't quite sit well enough for the large tub reliably. I am about to retire it because he wants to be in the large tub now but it served it's purpose well and was worth the price. He loves playing with it to hear the bean bag sounds and loves that Leachco tag on the side.We hung it to dry in the shower nightly and never noticed any mildew/mold and it dried quickly. The only downside of this vs an inflatable is that when he pooped in the tub once it was difficult to clean out. That was the only time I wasn't happy.
I received The First Year's Infant to Toddler tub as a shower gift.  It worked OK while we still had the sling in it but I have a large son (98% percentile) so he outgrew it very quickly.  The plastic bump in the middle was very inconveniently placed and made bath time difficult for me and uncomfortable for my son.  I order this tub to replace it and with I had gotten this tub first!  It is very versatile and you can use it as a tub or flip it over to use as a sling.  He can lay on his tummy while it's in the sling position making it very easy to actually wash him without having to hold him up with both arms.  He can't sit up by himself yet but the walls are tall enough that he can prop himself up against them, or he can lounge and use the edges as a sort of pillow.  After bath time is over this hangs with a very sturdy hook to dry.  I have been using it 3-4 times a week for just about a month now and have had no problems at all with it getting a musty odor as others have mentioned.  I find that it actually dries fairly quickly.  My only complaint is the sides could have just a little more beads in them so it is not so floppy if the tub isn't filled all the way.  Others have also complained about having to fill the whole tub in order to use this which it true.  It is fabric and will not hold water on it's own but I don't find that to be a problem.  It fills almost the whole tub anyways and I use the extra tub space to float toys for my son to reach for while on his tummy when it's flipped over to be more of a sling/lounge.  Overall it is definitely better than those hard plastic tubes and worth a shot.
I wish I would've read the reviews more carefully that this thing doesn't hold water!  What a drawbak for me.. and I discovered this too late and wasn't able to return it.  You ahve to fill the whole tub with water and then the water that comes into the tub is used.  It's got weird styrofoam pieces inside that make it safe for baby in case he falls over but it totally sucks that you have to waste so much water at bath time!  What a horrible invention.  I learned my lesson the hard way to real all available reviews carefully before I purchase.
I wish I had this for my first kid.  For him, we had the Fisher Price Whale tub and he was always sliding to one side or another, which was nerve wracking.  This is a very comfortable way to wash a newborn.  Having the water fill up the cushion keeps her nice and warm.  We hang this over the tub after each use and have had no problems in 4.5 months  I highly recommend it!
We found this wasn't the best thing to use in the bath regularly. It's a bit of work to wring the water out, and you never get it all out. It takes over a day to dry, which means if you use it daily you can expect mold/mildew.We did find it useful around the house outside the tub. If you ever need to lay your baby down somewhere secure and don't have time to prep it, this bath pad makes a handy pad that keeps your child in position.
I have used this bath pad with both of my sons, one 2 and the baby is 6 months. It's large enough that even my 99th percentile for height and weight 6 month old can fit with no problems. I've used the same one with no issues of mold but I wring it out really good and hang it up to dry. My older son likes to use it as a little bean bag, so I guess that means it's comfortable. I say if you're looking for a cheap way to bathe your baby in the tub, look no further!
this is a great washing tool for baby.  i wouldn't dream of using anything else.  since the umbilical cord fell off, my baby has been using this in our adult bathtub.  he doesn't slip and is comfortable lying on this.  he enjoys feeling like hes taking a bath even though the water level doesn't come past the point of the mat.  this is probably good up until baby can sit up and move around on their own
Saw this bath pad, read the reviews, and had to have it!  Now, I absolutely love it!  It's the perfect pad for 1 parent to bath their infants!  My experience with the big, bulky, plastic tubs is that infants tend to slide down while bathing them.  Thus forcing you to have 4 hands instead of 2.  With this pad, it so easy for me or my husband to bath our son with out any assistance from the other. My son, absolutely loves his bath pad.  While he has a tendency to pooh on it... it does wash up nicely.  I just drain it, then throw it in the washer.  My only complaint is that when you wash it, the foam filling does become a little distorted.  But it's not a big deal!  HIGHLY recommend!  Can't wait to buy it as a shower gift for a friend!
This is my FAVORITE baby item as a first time mom.  My infant son loves his baths thanks to this product.  He is safe, warm and cozy in this fabric cushion that literally dries faster than anything I've ever witnessed. Just hang it up and it drips dries fast for no mess or mold.  Forget the old hard plastic tubs that are slippery!  GET THIS!  You and your baby will love it.
I don't get all the good reviews of this product. I really don't like it. It's too big to fit comfortably in my standard size sink,and doesn't keep babies head inclined and out of the water in the tub.  It does seem comfy for baby,but she does easily get cold in it. There is n o way for baby to stay submerged in some water to stay warm. I much prefer the first years safety tub. There is a reason it's design has been around for years! It just works!
Very useful, very good quality, i totally love it! i did not give it 5 stars because after three months of using it, it changes its form.
My daughter had her first sponge bath with this and it has worked great ever since.  We put it in her Eurobath tub and she doesn't slide at all.  Bathtime is so much fun for everyone.  I highly recommend it to any parent.
My daughter was not the biggest fan of bath time until we got this bath pad. We had previously been given a larger bathtub at our baby shower, but our baby was premature and the tub was WAY too big for her. This tub fits her perfectly, supporting her upright and will work for months to come.
I have 3 boys, aged 4 and under, and it feels like I've tried every bathtub/ring/cushion on the market!  This is, by far, the absolute BEST bathtime product for babies aged newborn on up.  I bought this before my 3rd son was born.  He's used it from day one & it's great! he stays cozy and warm--it reclines him comfortably, too.  I haven't had any problems with mildew like a previous review mentioned, and we've been using it for 9 months now.  Even now that he's not content to lie still in the bathtub, the Safer Bather makes a comfy and slip-proof place for him to sit while he's being bathed (when he sits still, that is ;-) ).I'd HIGHLY recommend this over one of the uncomfortable, hard plastic infant tubs.  Neither of my older 2 kids liked baths until they could sit up in the tub.  If only I had used the Safer Bather sooner!
I used this for my daughter 3 years ago and now for my son who was just born in March.  The things I love are:1.It keeps the water warm and the baby stays cozy.2. It fits in my kitchen sink and allows baby's head to stay propped up.  For my daughter I put it in an infant sized tub where it fit beautifully.3. Baby's head doesn't flop side to side in it.4. It is thick and comfy for baby.My baby loves taking baths and I'm sure this mat helps immensely.
This item should of been plastic not cloth.when put to dry mold grows. Even if u wash it the mold doesnt go away.It also annoyingly soaks all the water.I wont recommend.
After my 3 month old decided she no longer liked the standard plastic infant bath tub, I was desperate to find another solution so that we could resume tear-free tubby time.  The Leachco bath pad fit the bill!  I also ordered the Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge to try out both options, but I really like the Leachco better.  The bath pad absorbs water really well and seems comfortable for the baby in either a sitting position or a reclining position.  There is also a square indentation on it the makes it easy to clean the undercarriage!  The Leachco is bigger than the Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge and seems to be made of higher quality materials.  (I put it in the washing machine per the instructions and it turned out fine.)  It is easy to dry between baths and I have had no issues with a mildew smell.  This has turned bath time into a fun and comfortable experience!
This is fits perfect inside my infant bathtub. My babys head and ears stay safely out of the water. Love it.
I bought this for my 2.5 month old who out grew his infant bath tub.  My baby loves to be able to splash and play and I love that he is comfortable.  I've had it for about a month and haven't had any issues with mold like some of the other reviewers had reported.  I always make sure I lean it up against the edge of the tub to drain the water from the mat.  It does come with a hook to hang it but I'm not sure where they expect you to hang it from with it being so heavy.  When not in use and dry I hang it from the shower curtain.
This pad is so much easier than a normal plastic baby tub. I do not have to worry about my little one slipping around during baths, I would recommend this product to anyone.
I registered for it because of all the great online reviews.  I am so glad that I received it for a shower gift.  It is great!!  My daughter is 1 month and does not fuss at all during bathtime.  It is like a little raft in the tub.  She fits in it perfectly and you do not have to worry about baby slipping or moving  around.  The pillow cushions baby safely.  I do agree it is a bit difficult to wring out but like others said if you hang it up it dries by the next morning.
I purchased the Leachco Safer Bather for my daughter when she was expecting her first child.  I had loved the inflatible bathtub I had for her 30 years ago, and the Leachco Safer Bather looked like a significantly improved bath aid.  After using this several times, I can say it has both it pluses and minuses.The bath pad is quite soft and makes an excellent cradle to help hold your infant while bathing.  If you are a first-time parent, then this bath pad will definitely provide you an extra measure of security and allow you to feel more comfortable when bathing your infant.  The pad will sit nicely on a counter; we found it did slide a bit and put some of the waffle-hole padding that one uses to keep rugs from slipping underneath it.  That solved the problem and made the pad sit securely on the counter surface.However, I did not rate this item as five stars for the following reasons.  The cover stains if your baby has an "accident" - even laundry stainremover and washing the pad immediately did not prevent this from happening.  Further, the cover picks up any lint in your washer, in addition to pilling some, so it must be washed alone.  I would suggest the manufacturer rethink the fabric on the covering and do something that would prevent immediate staining or provide instructions for removing stains.  A non-pilling fabric would also be much better.The third reason that I did not rate this as five stars is that I believe it has a very limited useful life.  Because it has low sides and the well for the child is not particularly deep, it may not be of much value once your child can sit up.  The inflatible bath tubs have higher sides so that when a child is sitting up, if they happen to tip over, might be able to avoid a nasty head bump.  In the bathing pad, if the child tips over, they could quite possibly hit their head on the side or bottom of the bathtub.I also have concerns that the bath pad may slip when placed in a tub.  The instructions say to soak it, but there are no suction pads on the bottom so that it can adhere to the tub's surface.  The inflatible tubs with which I am familiar do suction to the tub's surface and allow for better infant security.If you have extra funds to spend on your child or grandchild, this might be a good option.  However, I would definitely recommend exploring the various inflatible tubs that are available since they will have a longer useful life and seem to be more secure.
Our son LOVES taking a bath and it's worry-free for us, thanks to the Safer Bather.  This leight-weight bath pillow is perfect for baths in the kitchen sink or inside another tub.  Although our son still fits in the kitchen sink with it, we bought it along with the Primo baby tub and it's an ideal match together.The soft pillow protects our son's head and little body from the sink/tub.  There is a little sunken-in area for his little bottom and he LOVES to sit in it and splash around while we bathe him.  After the bath, we simply give it a squeeze and hang it in the shower to drip-dry overnight.  It can be machine washed but will pill-up if it goes through the dryer.  (still works beautifully, though.)This is a FANTASTIC product to bring while traveling - it's allowed us to give him his bath while on vacation or at grandma's house.I HIGHLY recommend this product!
When my daughter was first born we bought a bath sponge in the shape of a bear that was about 2 inches thick. For the first month or two while we bathed her in a baby bathtub it worked great. But once we moved her into a big bathtub we realized we needed something more.This bath pillow elevates the head of the baby while giving her a lot of support throughout the body. You can posistion it at the end of your tub so she is on an incline as well.I liked that this pillow grows with your baby and will be good at helping an older baby sit in the bath better making bath time more enjoyable.It has a hanger that is attached so you just hang it to let it dry. And the auquarium print on it is gender neutral.
I liked using this for my premiee baby girl once she grew out of her NICU bath at home but after a few months use it gave her a rash on her back. I didn't think it was the bath pad giving her the rash until her 3 year old sister started to get the same rash on her bottom because she liked to sit on it after my baby girl got out. I would not reccomend this product.
this is great. My baby outgrew the baby bathtub sling a while ago and this is great. It's so comfy for him and easy to manage. No more filling the tub and breaking my back to carry it to the counter. I just plop this thing down in the  bathtub and that's it. I ended up bending a wire clothes hanger and using that as a hook to hang it up in the shower in order to let it drip dry. Very easy. Love it.
I received this as a shower gift. I squeezed this foam bathing pad out after every bath and hung it to air dry each time, using it once a week for my newborn. It was so disappointing when it started to stink of mildew after only four baths! I purchased a Boon Naked Collapsible Baby Tub to replace it and highly recommend everyone purchase that instead! Worth the extra cost!
Our babies love this pillow so much, they don't want to get out of the tub.  It makes for a safe, comfortable bathing experience and it dries very quickly when it hangs.
We got this bath pad for our 3 month old and initially loved it, as he sat there so comfortably while we washed him, but within even the first month he started getting a horrible rash on his back due to contact with the bath pad.  We have always cleaned and hung to dry, but we live in a warm climate and clearly the mildew grows inside of the mat unless you have professional drying equipment.  To avoid buying another pad we have attempted to use wet towels over the pad so that his skin does not come in direct contact with the infected pad, but unfortunately this does not appear to be enough.  Our baby is now six months and has an ongoing and painful looking rash on his back where it has been touching the bath pad.BOTTOM LINE: If you plan to buy 10 pads (for $250??) and treat them like disposable items - polluting the landfills and throwing your money away in the process - then this pad is wonderful, but for all of the sane people out there, please do not make the same mistake we did. There are better bath options out there that do not jeopardize the skin health of your baby.  We are so sorry we bought this pad.
This has worked out great for our infant son so far. The only things that bother me are the way hairs get trapped in the material (usually mine) and how the material has gotten stretched out at the top from the weight of the water as it's being hung up to dry. I don't looooove the print, but it's cute enough. None of these affect its usability, however, and it keeps him warm and out of the water and seems much more comfortable than plastic. We've had no mold issues but I've noticed that sometimes there seems to be a dark/questionable spot because of a trick of light on the filling inside (the fabric is slightly see-through).
If you are a soon-to-be parent who is as nervous about bathing your newborn as I was, this is for you!  This cushioned seat perfectly positions your baby for sponge baths. It is contoured to keep your baby in place and provide cushion and support for her head. It kept my baby comfortable long enough to get her clean. I only give it four stars because unlike some parents, I do not think this product is best for water baths. I found that when I tried to use it in the kitchen sink it soaked up A LOT of water and had to be washed to prevent mildew.  Although it is machine washable, it does get those fuzzy little pills of cloth attached to it, which are a pain to pull off. Also, I don't see how a baby much older than a month can fit in it, as it is very small. If you are looking for a great bathtub for your infant check out the EuroBath, which I couldn't recommend more highly!
This was really not what I expected. I have it away rather than returning it. I wanted something that would deflate and take up little space. I was also concerned about mold build up in a sponge this big. I definitely would not recommend this item.
i reccomend this to anyone looking for a safe baby bath. awesome for first time parents. its soft and cushy and baby doesn't slide around. my daughter is 10 months old and still uses it. she has used it since day oen. i wouldn't go with any other tub. safest tub you can buy.it does hold a lot of water, but as long as you hang it to dry, it is fine. drys overnight when its hung up. the best part.. you can toss it in the washer when it gets dirty.A MUST HAVE for new mothers and fathers!
This was a bathtime must have for us! We never used the tiny plastic tubs, but just bathed our little one on this cushy bath pad in our regular tub.  It was comfy and made bathing her and washing her hair so easy. It has a hook to hang it to dry which is also handy.  Great product.
We love this bath pad. The only con is it takes a while to dry and finding somewhere good to hang it can be a pain. It's a great size for bathing our daughter in the sink comfortably.
I really liked this for my newborn. I use it in large sink and now tub. Its comfy for her to lay on while I sponge her with soap and rinse her. I dont like the baby tubs till they are several months old so this was perfect
It soaks up so much water and takes to long to dry.  Not really what I was expecting or looking for.  Still looking for that perfect baby bather.
With a newborn it is very hard to give a bath in one of those plastic tubs or the sink because I had to try and hold his head for him and somehow really get in between all of his folds.  Those were too hard for me and I ended up just giving him spnge baths while he lied on a towel.This bath pad is perfect! I don;t have to worry about him slipping and sliding all over the place and i can easliy move his body parts to clean.I love it!(I have washed it several times and always hang it dry after the bath----but it does seem to have a mildew smell after a couple baths.) I'm thinking of putting it in the sun to help.  It still is great though!
I was startled when I pulled this out of the box because it was so much bigger than I thought it would be.  I saw the pictures other people posted of their babies using this in the sink, and figured I could do the same.  I was completely wrong -- it's way too big for that.  I guess some people have really huge sinks!  So I was initially disappointed that I had to use this in the tub with a 2-wk-old baby -- but I loved it almost as soon as I tried it.  It's soft with plenty of cushioning so she's relaxed and comfortable.  The material holds in water and stays warm.  The head is slightly angled upward so it's harder for the standing water to get into her ears.  It's easy to squeeze out and hang up to dry on the shower rod (though it takes until the next day to get completely dry).  I haven't had any issues with it getting smelly, after 4 months of twice-a-week use.  But the directions on the tag clearly tell you how to wash it, if it does start to smell.  Now that my daughter's bigger and her feet reach past the bottom, she loves kicking her feet in the water.  I think I'm going to start gifting these to pregnant friends.
My baby didn't like baths so this was a huge help. With this, he could lie down comfortably while I clean him up, I don't have to worry about him slipping around. It fits our sink perfectly and while the color has started to fade but it still serves its purpose. The hanger is very convenient, i just hang the whole thing to dry and it's ready for the next use.
After reading all the great reviews I decided this would be perfect for my son who has just grown out of his newborn tub and does not like the baby bath seat I got him. I was not disappointed. I gave him a bath in it for the first time tonight and it was so much easier to bathe him than in a newborn tub. He was very comfortable and happily kicked away without me having to worry about him falling out of the tub from the force! I was also able to wash his hair so much easier with him laying sideways like this.The hanger makes it so easy to hang this up after his bath to let the water drain and dry it out.I am really impressed and very happy with my purchase! I'm heading over to Moms.com right now to recommend it. Then off to Weespring!
This is the best.  I use it with a large infant tub and my baby is supported wonderfully.  It gives him a cushy padding that makes his bath more pleasurable.  He's still getting use to taking a bath and he cried much louder in a normal tub.  Now he hangs out and only cries once I start washing his hair.  It dries quickly and easily (I just hang it in the shower).  You can use it in a tub or sink, but the other infant tub works best for me.
I had used a foam pillow for my son so when I saw this I was thrilled.  Easy to use, much more comfortable for baby than a regular 'baby bath' it takes up less room and absorbs the warm water keeping baby warm .  Always used it by/in the sink until her cord fell off and now she will always be in the 'big bath' so no 'new fear' to conquer when she is older and when we travel how EASY it is to take with us!
Way more compact than those bulky plastic tubs, it hangs in the closet in the nursery to dry and is pretty darned comfortable and cradling for our little guy. It makes it convenient for sponge baths too! I can set it on the vanity next to the bathroom sink and get all the business done quickly and comfortably. I &#9829; this thing!
I bought this for my son and daughter-in-law's baby shower. They have a Dr. Seuss theme for the baby's room and for the baby. This bath pad was delivered safely, and on time. It is of good quality, and is a good price compared to items of similar nature that are non themed. There is a Cat in the Hat hooded towel and wash cloths that can be bought along with the bath pad to make a complete Dr. Seuss bath set. Although, their price are not as competitive with similar items.  This bath pad is colorful, and can be used for a baby of either sex.My son and his wife are happy. It goes well with their chosen theme. It is sturdy, colorful, and beautiful, just like the baby we are all waiting to see.
This is a must have.  I used the same pillow with all three of my kids.  It has help up well for 7 years.  I periodically put it in the clothes washer for a good cleaning.  I never had a problem with the mildew smell as one person commented.  I used this in 2 different baby tubs to make it softer for my boys and to keep them from sliding around.  I also used this in the sink. I like that because it is spongy, it holds warm water longer.  This really is a great product. So far as tubs go, I tried putting my infant in a tub with a sling, and the sling was too narrow and didn't give enough.  And they hold the babies so high out of the water, they get cold quick. It was so stiff, I felt like he was going to fall off of it.  I also don't like tubs with baby stoppers in them - the bump that their bottoms sit on to keep them from sliding down.  And the minute the baby starts sitting up, those bumps are uncomfortable for them.  Find a tub that doesn't have a stopper or one that is removable. FP has one in their ocean wonders line.  If you have this bath pillow, you don't need a sling or a stopper, so you can get a tub with less going on in it, and use it longer.
Before I bought this, I read the reviews and saw that some people had mold issues.  I made sure that I wrung it out each and every time, hanging to dry.  After 5 months straight of using it and loving it, it finally started to smell moldy. So I tossed it with 100% satisfaction that I got great use out of it.  I ordered another one - but after just a week or so, the mold started.  Perhaps it's hit or miss?
What a fantastic product!  My little Luca is 10 months old and I still use it!  From the day I took him home from the hospital I have used this wonderful product!The outer fabric is cheerful and bright!  It is durable fabric and is nice and soft for your baby.  Before baby can sit up, you actually use this tub "upside down."  Baby lays on it!  Enough of your tub water fills up the little well baby's little body makes so he/she stays nice and warm.  Washing hair on this is great!  This is 100% NOT slippery!  No more having to hold baby with one arm and wash with the other arm!  You WILL finally enjoy giving your baby a bath!When baby can sit up, turn this around and it is like well, my 7 year old calls it a "tubby, boaty, floaty thing."  It offers a fantastic barrier or cushion all around your baby.  It even gets you passed the stage where your baby can't really sit up but wants to.  I found that my little guy was happy to recline even on the "boat" side!Clean up is a snap but you MUST maintain this to keep it fresh.  After baby's bath, just shake it out and hang it up.  I keep mine on the shower head or shampoo rack!  This product just drips dry.I have been using mine daily for the past 11 months and mine does not smell or have mold.  I am a freak about baby's things being clean and fresh and am thrilled with this product!
I really like this bath pad. My little guy nestles nicely into it and I don't have to worry about him sliding around on it. It's also nice because I can spray it with warm water before I put him on it and it will retain the warmth so it's not a cold shocker on him. Has a nice plastic hanger on the top that is great for hanging it on the shower curtain rod to dry. You really do have to be diligent about drying it and letting all of the surfaces to be exposed to air otherwise it will mold but it can be thrown in the washing machine too.
My grandson loves his bather. This light weight bather, comes with a handle to hang and dry after use. Shapes to infants body cushions baby. Love this
The safer bather is the BEST baby bath aid out there! It's soft but not squishy, contoured so baby dosn't roll off, small and easy to store, machine washable, and babies love it! What else could you ask for? I don't know how anyone could choose one of those big, clunky tubs over this.***UPDATE***Almost 3 years, two kids and many baths later this safer bather is still getting used and works just like it did when it was new!
It doesn't float and it doesn't stay submerged. Really wet and heavy too so it's kind of a pain to use.
This is an amazing product.  I use this with the Infant to Toddler Bath by Evenflo and the combo works great.  The baby is comfortable and doesn't slip around.  Holds up nicely, baby is so comfortable.  I used this product until my baby was able to sit up.  I have another one on the way, and am going to use this all over again with her.  A must have; I highly recommend.
Works very well for a newborn. Better than the big hard tubs. Our baby is 7 weeks old and this is great so he doesn't slip onto the water and get water in his ears. Just what we were looking for. Make sure you dry outside as oer the package insert. Not necessarily mold resistant.
I like this infant bath pad because it holds my son well, has ample cushion, is soft, and easy to use.  I highly recommend it.
This was just the special and helpful gift I was looking for. I bought it for a baby shower so I don't know yet how the mother and baby likes it, but I think they will. Very soft with a convenient hang-up hook so it can dry. Seems to be made well. I wish I had something like this when my son was a baby!
Finally I can bathe my son alone without waiting for my husband to come home to help me.  You Definitley have to submerge the bath pad in the warm water to prevent cold spots where they lay.  Once you do, it works great. My son is 3 months and we are still using it.
I used this for until my baby could sit up in the regular bathtub on her own. I was trying to avoid buying a bunch of bulky baby items that would require storing between baby births. So I opted for this for our first baby. It is so light weight and small so it's easy to store away until our next baby needs it. It worked great for just laying in our regular bathtub and you can just hang it on the shower head to dry. It comes with a hook to hang it up. I would definitely recommend it.
I got this as a shower gift and I don't know what I'd do without it. It helps with sponge bathing newborns and it keeps the baby warm when water is poored over it. I lay it on the bathroom counter and fill tHE sink with water. The only minor problem is the water goes through, but I put a big towel underneath it so it cathes the water. I like the hook on the top so it's easy to hang up to air dry over the shower head. I haven't had any problems with mildew and it is machine washable. Excellent product!!
I bought this pad after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon.  So far, it has been great!  The first couple of baths that I gave my newborn (now 2.5 month old) were in the plastic Primo Eurotub.  It seemed so hard and cold and it was really impossible to hold my very active little one steady in the tub while bathing him.  With the pad, however, he lies comfortably reclined in the Eurotub, waiting for me to pour warm water over his body.Also, washing the pad is fairly easy - I'd know, because during one bath, my guy decided to let out the nastiest poo (watery, breast-fed poo) all over the pad and into the tub.  My husband immediately rinsed off the pad and threw it in the wash and it was almost as good as new.  The ONLY issue that I have with it is that after that machine wash, the material has started to pill.
We originally got aPRI EuroBath, Pearl Whitebut quickly realized it would take up about half of our small apartment bathroom.  We got this instead and love it!  I use it in our tub (we don't have a large enough kitchen sink) and have done so since our son was born.  We still use it now and he is almost 6 months.  I think we will probably stop using it as soon as he can sit up on his own.Provides nice support for your baby, and keeps baby's head slightly elevated and out of the water.  In addition, since the pad is like a giant sponge, it keeps baby warm while you are bathing him.  Also easy to just hang in the bath to dry.Great product!  Highly recommend!
really not ideal for safety. It's flat and goes on the bottom of the tub. I don't like it- maybe it works for other but not me.
This bowl is cute and difficult for my daughter to lift and throw.  However, if your high chair has a smaller tray, this bowl will not fit.  For example, we have theFisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat - Blue, and the bowl does not fit on the tray - it is too large for the tray.
I'd give this a 5 if it fit on the tray on our highchair. I recommend you measure your tray and see the dimensions on this plate-- it's a bigger plate than most baby plates.In every other way, this is a great set. Spoons are well designed, fit in kids' hand. Plate is difficult or impossible for child to lift/throw (we have never had that happen).
The spoons are great for a toddler.  The plate is very much like a dog bowl.  It is a little too bulky and a pain to store since you cannot stack that easily with your other bowls.Update after 2 yrs: still using it but white part of bowl gets stained and scratched easily.  Also the spoon is plastic so it has lots of bite marks. If i were to do it all over again, i would just get the spoons.  Spoons are great for 9m+ especially for soupy foods.  But spoons stain easily.  They are orange now.  To be honest, you'll be fine with the munchkin metal and plastic set for $4.  I have those and toddler is fine with that, too.  Munchkin utensils fit into Boon lawn dish rack better.  The baby bjorn spoons have thick handles so they do not fit well standing up.
Designed/weighted well. The spoons were good for infant and still good at 16 months for toddler, with deep bowls and easy for her to hold and use herself. The sides of the bowl are deep, which helps for scooping food onto the spoon when she is self-feeding. They've held up well in the dishwasher and have survived being thrown on the tile floor.
I went BabyBjorn crazy and bought a lot of their product line once my daughter was old enough to start using it.  I think that their line is "Ok" but not the greatest overall. I actually bought 2 of this set. This set comes with 2 spoons (black and pink) and 1 pink dish.  Great colors.  The spoon fits well in my 15 months hand and mouth and she likes it.  I have to hold the plate as she eats because the bowl moves with slight force.  She is also able to pick it up and throw it though the instructions say that picking the bowl up for a baby is difficult.  Not so.  I was very concerned about it being plastic but it is NOT #7 (hard plastic) and is free of BPA.  Hard plastic and #7 plastics are the ones we need to stay away from though all plastic is questionable.  This set is "ok" as she learns to eat from a bowl with a spoon, but then it's quickly on to a non plastic dish.  Still looking for stainless steel baby bowl.  Please DO NOT put ANY plastic in a microwave especially food for your baby.  There are just too may unknowns out there about plastic.
He plays with the spoons all the time.  Haven't used the bowl yet, but I can tell it will work great.  Very smart design.
This bowl is cute and difficult for my daughter to lift and throw. However, if your high chair has a smaller tray, this bowl will not fit.
I really like this plate. The edges are design in a way that the food doesn't dance around while my toddler is trying to scoop it. It makes teaching using utensils a lot easier. I also love the look of the plate and spoons. They have funky and fun colors! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!
Baby can easily hold and feed herself with these spoons -- they are great. A little pricey but I think worth it.
This bowl is relatively hard for my daughter to tip over, and it is supposedly dishwasher and microwave safe. These are the reasons I bought it. Many other plastic bowls are melamine or contain BPAs and should not be microwaved. That does not appear to be an issue with this one.The spoons are OK. They are a bit too wide and not as soft on teething babies' gums as some of the more rubbery options on the market, but they are fine and have nice stubby handles for babies to hold onto.My bowl did not come with a black spoon like in the picture. I received the advertised pink spoon, but my secondary spoon was green. For me, that was fine and even preferable, but if for some reason you're really excited about a black spoon with your pink bowl, beware.
It's a very simple design that aesthetically blends right in with her white crib.  It's got lots of variety for the baby with the characters that spin around and the two types of music and white noise.  It's part of our naptime routine and seems to really soothe her.  The remote control is so key, too!  Am really glad we got this model.
My son loved this mobile! It is recommended that mobiles be removed from cribs when baby is 5 months old, but the toys from it are removable and now make great playthings for him. They rattle, squeak, etc., and he just loves holding them and biting them.The remote control did not work unless we were about 3 feet away from the crib, so that was not worth it.While there are some nice music selections, the overall quality of the music sounded sort of muffled and scratchy. But, my son did not seem to care.Overall, this is a good product that's very attractive to babies, and the mobile parts can be used as toys after the mobile is taken down from the crib.
This is a really wonderful mobile.  My now 10 week old daughter loves it.  I really like the fact that it hesitates so the baby can focus in.  The music is real nice, and the white noise seems to lull her to sleep.  The remote control works up to four feet, which is enough to activate it again from the bedroom door.  The swivel arm is great, moving it out of the way.There are a few drawbacks though.  Yes, it is very difficult to get the battery in, but it is doable.  The lowest noise setting still seems to be to loud for the two music options, for my daughter to sleep.  The biggest drawback is that if you accidentaly bump into the moblie it makes a lot of noise, with all the plastic pieces having little balls inside, to wake the baby.  But, i still highly recommend this mobile, just be careful not to bump into it or the crib while the baby is sleeping.
Purchased 2 of these for small grand children - not impressed.  If the cost to return the item wouldn't have been so much I would have returned them immediately.  They can be used with much effort but the securing device is too low on the babies to be safe.
I'm not sure if it will hold up, but it fits our needs right now.  Our son is 3 years old and it doesn't seem appropriate to have him in a high chair or a booster that clips on the table. But he is still too small to sit at the table in an adult chair.  This works great for the size & I like that it's portable. I just wish you could remove the seat belt.  My son is too big for the seat belt.
This booster seat folds up compactly for travel and is easy to bring along.  You can pull the straps through the handle to make a shoulder strap. It is definitely for older babies. I prefer to use it in a chair that has arm rests so that my baby can't topple off to the side. My ten month old sits in it and eats fine, but his weight can easily shift. I would not leave a child unattended for even a second in this booster, because I think they could be seriously hurt if they leaned over too far.  The fabric on the side provides no support. It is merely funcntional for holding the seat back at the correct angle. However, I just wanted something that would be easier than holding the baby on my lap. This meets that criteria and was the right price for infrequent use. The patterned fabric on the seat looks better in person, but it doesn't really match the other blue/periwinkle fabric. I followed the instructions to allow the seat to expand overnight, and after that it inflated and deflated easily. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase.
My mother-in-law bought this for my daughter to use at her house, and it's great!PROS:It folds down easilyOpens up just as easily3-point harness for safetyClips are STRONGTightens down under chair and behind chair easily, but holds really well too (even if my daughter kicks and wiggles in her chair, the straps don't loosen up)To sum it up... safe, strong, easy, easy, easy!  :-)CONS:Hmm, I can't really think of one!  I just wish I bought this one for us instead of the fold-n-go seat!I highly recommend!
I bought this on the go booster seat because we travel a lot to visit family but it was very disappointing.PROS:1. Easy to install2. Inflates without any effort.3. Compact and easy to carry.CONS: (which outweighed by a lot the PROS)1. Extremely unsteady. No matter where I installed it or how I installed it that chair could flip around with my daughter in it. It actually did!2. It doesn't fit well in every chair. Depending on the dinning room chair size you will be able to use this booster or not.3. After constant use the chair doesn't stay inflated.Overall, don't waste your money on this booster seat! Is dangerous for children who like to move around which I am pretty sure they are the majority.
We bought this for an extended trip we were taking.I was not disappointed.It worked great and attached to all different seats (although we had to get creative at times).Very compact and easy to fit into the suitcase.
Bought this when we were going on vacation and renting a house. We knew the place wouldn't have a highchair or booster, so we bought this. It packs small and light and does the job. My son was 13 months when we first used it. We keep it in our car for times we might need it now.
This extension fit our first years hands free gate perfectly. I was concerned that adding an extension would make the gate more wobbly, but once it is clipped in it is just as sturdy as the original gate by itself.
It is just perfect. This extension is great. It works. It just slides right into the gate. No assembly required.
We have a doorway between the front room and kitchen that must be a non-standard width, because the gate alone is a smidge too small, but when we added the extension, the whole unit wouldn't fit in the doorway.  It would be better design if there was an overlap of about 1/2" between the two sizes.
My neighbor gave me 3 First Years Hands Free Gates that were from when her 5 year old daughter was young, but they needed the extensions, and I was worried I wouldn't be able to get them since the gates were older.  These fit perfectly.  They don't compromise the sturdiness of the gate at all, and blend in nicely with the rest of the gate.
We bought two of these extensions for the Hands Free Gate that we use for our triplets that just turned a year old. This gate including extensions are a lifesaver! You can read my review on the gate as well, lol. The extensions are very easy to add and very sturday. Adding them does not make the gate weaker by extending it out like some gates do. It is just what it states, an extension. It keeps it just as strong as sturdy! Worth the money!
Made nice just like the gate.  Once you put it on there you will forget it's an attachment and just think the gate was made that way.
I have the older style hands free First Years gate and was a little concerned if this would fit but it fits perfectly and my gosh it really makes a difference. The gate fit our hallway before the extension but the supports were almost all the way extended so when we saw that the extension was only 15.00 we decided to give it a go.I do not know how we lived without it. It used to be kinda wobbly and I found myself tightening it every few days. I have not had to tighten it since we bought this extension. I is sooooooooooooooooo much sturdier.
I bought this because I wanted a carrier for short trips instead of always hauling a stroller.  The price was good but it's VERY uncomfortable to wear and never sits on the body right.  My daughter screamed whenever she was in it or she made her body very stiff like she was scared beyond belief.  I don't feel that this carrier is very safe and it's very difficult to get baby in and out.  Spend your money on a better one.  Yes it is soft but look at others.
This is my 4th carrier. My son is 3 months old, 17 pounds. I have a sling, a hip sling and a snuggli-the stripped down model. I got this one because I needed something that I could wear for extended periods with my baby facing out that would not restrict my movement too much. I bought it used, without instructions. I had no trouble figuring out how to use it. There are a number of adjustments to be made, but you only have to do it once, until your baby grows enough to move to the next setting. I made all the adjustments myself, with my baby in the carrier. It is a lot easier to get him in and out of than the the regular inward facing snugli. there are little buckles and velcro on the sides that you can undo to get baby in and out. I like that I didn't have to force my baby's feet into the holes, there is plenty of room for even big chunky thighs. A lot of people have complained about how hard it was to get baby in and out, but I don't know what they are comparing it to. I love that I could adjust everything to fit my baby perfectly. The carrier is soft and cozy. My baby felt safe and secure. My only complaint is that there is no waist strap, so I did feel a little strain in my back, and I felt a bit front heavy. Aside from that I think this is a really great carrier for the price. The only comparable brands cost more than 3 times as much. I think it's a really good deal.
We tried several different brands of these carriers before going with the Infantino. I actually had my child with me in our huge &quot;convertible&quot; carrier, and saw a woman with her infant in the Infantino. I was sold on sight.Plus side: the carrier is well suited for infants from birth until about 6 months. They will not be lost in it, or too heavily restrained. It works nicely facing in or out, which is not true of most other brands. WIDE STRAPS THE WHOLE WAY AROUND! Most carriers pad the child, and then leave very thin, abrasive nylon straps to bite into your shoulders and sides. Not Infantino. The criss-cross straps on your back also do a better job of distributing the load than some carriers we tried. CHEAP! You could pay a fortune for one of those fancy oversized Scandanavian carriers with all the buckles, but why?Minus side: Small size. Excellent for 0-4 months, kind of pushing it from 4-6. They don't make an identical but larger one, so the time factor is limited. Burp cloth is a joke, tiny and fastened on with small velcro dots. Rips off if the kid tugs on it. I tossed the one that came with ours, and started using a cloth diaper. Also, the head-hold straps are meant to be under the armpits on older babies, but they are not padded (no problem for the headrest) and poke into the baby's sides if you're not careful.I recommend this to all parents and all friends buying for parents.
This was an amazing find for my granddaughter! She truly loves bright colors and I am so excited that it worked so well! Low spillage
I decided to give it a try despite some of the bad reviews, figuring they could be just unlucky. After trying these sippy cups a few times when my son was 6 month old, and again at 10 month old, I have to agree with these 1 star reviews... it's not your child, it's not the parent, it's the sippy cups problem:- Leaks no matter how many times I followed the instructions, re-read, assemble and disassemble. I use a phlilips avent steamer sterilizer for the bottle part only, and I thought I had warped it somehow so that it leaks from the sides. So I brought another one (and did not put it in the sterilizer or washing machine) and it still leaks!! :(- the flow is just too fast. I tried this sippy cup when my son was 6 months and he kept choking cause the flow was just too fast for him. I thought maybe he wasn't ready yet, and this was a good sippy cup. I was wrong. I tried a few more times at 10 months old, the flow is just still too fast he ends up either choking or having his shirt soaked with water.It's a cute cup, I hope it's just a matter of bad quality control only and others have better luck with this.
A little before our boy reached one year old, our pediatrician told us to gradually make the shift to more and more solid foods. The transition was easy. She also suggested that the boy should not be using nipples beyond the year one and we should gradually shift over to using sippy cups.We've used Avent bottles, for the most part, and have been very satisfied with them. As such, when the transition came we simply switched over to the Avent 9-ounce Magic Trainer. It took a little while, but the transition was easy and it's now the only bottle he uses. No problems. He picked up on the difference real fast.Gary Peterson
These cups leak like crazy! I took pictures of them leaking. I will be uploading them into amazon's product picture page, we'll see if it's approved. There is a hole at the base of the nozzle, right where it meets the colored plastic. I don't know why the hole is there, but all of the cups have this design flaw. Don't waste your money on these cups. They are cute, but they leak and make a terrible mess. I've tried gerber cups and those were a lot better.
This was the first sippy cup that my boy used and its still his favorite, even though he can drink from just about any sippy cup now. Recently, I discovered that I could use the nipple and handle on regular Avent bottles that we already had. This was great for when I fell behind on doing dishes... I simply rinsed the nipple attachment and put it on the Avent bottles. It also allowed us to bring along a few different drinks on trips and simply move the nipple/handle to the different drinks depending on what he wanted.I've not had a problem with leaking or losing parts... I'm not sure why some would find them hard to take apart? It has like three peices? Leaking hasn't been an issue at all, in fact these were the only type I had that didn't leak. Of course they have to be assembled right to not leak. If you forget the valve, they will leak.I particularly like the spout design which allows him to drink without getting solids into the cup. When he drank during his meals with the Gerber cup, all sorts of particles would end up in the cup. Not so with this one.
These cups - the entire Avent line, for that matter - seem so wonderful in theory.  But in practice, they're pretty terrible, and I can't for the life of me figure out how the Avent line came to be so hyped.  (A friend of mine speculates it has a lot to do with the cups, bottles, etc being pretty - I'm inclined to agree.)In a way, these cups remind me of the nursery rhyme my mother would chide me with when I was younger, about the little girl with the little curl in the middle of her forehead.  When she was good, she was very, very good - and when she was bad, she was horrid!When these cups are working right, they are wonderful!  But - These cups are STRANGE.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to them.  Sometimes they leak from the spout, sometimes they leak from the collar, but the same cup will not always leak in the same way, if it leaks at all.  Avent bottles have the same leaky collar issue and if you call Avent they will tell you that you must have over-tightened the collar, that the collar is supposed to be tightened using the clear plastic over-cap, not touching the collar directly.  Huh?  Who would think to do it that way?  Why would you put a cap on just to tighten the collar and then remove it?  But it's a moot point because any way I do it, loose or tight, collar or cap to tighten, sometimes they leak, sometimes they don't.All that is after you account for the fact that the larger cups only come with the harder green spouts, which are for toddlers.  This is OK, I suppose...  but the white soft spouts just SEEM nicer, my kid seems to prefer them, and the green spouts are much harder to remove the valves from because they are so stiff!  So when I bought these cups I had to then spend extra money on the white spouts, and that is all we used - which may or may not account for my next problem.  I don't know if it strikes the green spouts or not.Over time, these cups stop working.  You will hand it to your child, he will suck for a bit, get angry, and hand the cup back to you.  You will try the cup.  All you will get is a hiss of air, no liquid.  Early on, you can remove the cap and press harder to snap the valve in place...  but then after a while, nothing works.  You have to replace the caps and valves.  And maybe I'm just an idiot but it bothers me to throw away things that are perfectly OK, and it bothers me that you can't figure out just WHICH part of the cap/valve set has gone bad, you have to either replace all your caps and valves at once or end up playing sippy cup roulette having an odd mixing of new and old spouts/valves that may or may not work when you put them together.In short, this cups have nearly driven me insane.Oh, and my favorite, favorite part about these cups - NOT - is if you use them with the nipple, your kid can push the nipple down inside the cup and spill milk (or whatever) all over the place.  My guy first figured this out while we were out in the stroller and he had a cup of strawberry kefir.  A pretty much full cup.  What a mess!These cups also hold sour milk smell worse than any other cup I have tried (and we've tried a lot)  They pretty much have to be washed in the dishwasher or else repeatedly sterilized which can get annoying.  Of course this can be prevented by washing your cups immediately, every time, but let the mom who has never discovered a squirreled-away sippy full of homemade yogurt cast the first stone...I guess the biggest thing these cups offer over the competition is they have caps.  Most other sippies don't - actually I don't know of any that do.  But we've switched to playtex and I'm pretty happy with them.  No leaks, fewer parts, only one part to go bad...Avent...  ugh.  I've used and hated the breastpump, the bottles, and now the sippies.
Our son is almost 16 months old and we have been using these sippy cups for about 10 months now.  We have never had them leak, mold, spouts push through or anything!  I suggest reading the directions before tossing these sippy cups in the trash.  I cannot get over how many parents assume that the Avent line is alot of "hype" just because they failed to read directions.As for the complaints about mold and sour milk...that's just gross.  Wash the sippy cup after it's used.  I'm sure any other brand would get moldy and smelly if you left it in your trunk all summer...not Avent's fault!Anyway, as for the green spouts being stiffer than the white ones and more difficult to clean...OK, maybe for the first few times because they are new; but they WILL get more pliable.  I spoke to an Avent rep at the Baby Fair in Edison, NJ and she suggested buying new spouts every month or so (same for nipples with Avent bottles).  They do wear out...especially if you're using the same two or three sippy cups every day.I just bought (and tried) the "sport spout" and although it is quite a mouthful of liquid that comes out, our son has no problem with that spout, either.  No leaks so far.All in all, read the directions and you will see the leaks disappear like MAGIC!  Good luck!
Our wipe warmer has been on since we brought our son home November, 2003. At those 3am winter morning feedings, this product was great. My baby never cried during a diaper change and I think this warmer had something to do with it. I only rate it 4 stars because the diaper organizer was a waste, it does not hang well so I took it off immediately and stored the diapers in a wicker basket on a shelf of our changing table. Also the wipes do get yellow at the bottom but we add water even though the instructions say not to. We use wipes from Costco and they work really well in the warmer, Huggies does as well, never tried Pampers. I would recommend any parent get a wipe warmer, it is a lifesaver.
I thought this would be a wonderful way to be nice to our baby with the warmer wipes but it seems like they feel good when I initially open the door and get the wipe but it seems like they are already cold again by the time I start using it on the baby.  Also the bottom few wipes always seem to get dry and brown so we waste a few wipes with each refill.  It's an OK product but if I wouldn't buy it again.
Warmers stated "will not yellow the wipes".  BULL!  Not only do they turn yellow they dry out!  I had my warmer plugged it for 1 month and through it out!  Every mom thinks they NEED warm wipes.  Use a conventional warm wash cloth.  It's better for baby anyways.  To much chemicals.  Save your money ladies!
I'd like to give 4+ stars to the warmer, 3 stars for the diaper organizer. The wipey warmer is a luxury every baby deserves. I have 2, one upstairs and one down. I place the wipes in a ziploc bag inside the warmer. It minimizes dry-out. It may be a little laborious, but it really seems to help. Once they dry a bit, I add some water. The bottom wipe sometimes turns brown, so it's best not to pack too many in at a time so they can get circulated. It also helps to unplug it overnight to minimize drying. These are all minor hinderences, but the organizer is the bigger hassle. I have mine attached to the co-sleeper. Though it fits the edge snuggly, it doesn't take much to knock it off. The diapers are contained with a zippered area. I find it to be too much trouble to unzip it every time I need a diaper so I have just left it open, at which point, diapers end up scattered all over the floor. Now the diapers sit on my end table for a quick reach. The organizer isn't totally functionless, however, as I use it to store her extra burp rags. All in all, I'm glad I have the product, I have just modified it to suit my needs, and my baby doesn't protest to diaper changes anymore.
I loved this product at first and I know my daughter enjoyed it for the first two months.  After a while though, it began drying out too quickly and literally burning the wipes on the bottom.  The last thing you want to have to do is throw away 1/3 of your wipes because they are brown and dry.
A friend recommended a wipe warmer after he got one for his 4th child.  Since the Especially For Baby one seemed a reasonable price, we experimented with it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work well with either of the wipes we tried - Pampers or Huggies.  And the extra storage just didn't provide much "storage".  So we've taken it back and our daughter doesn't seem to mind the room temperature wipes that clean her cute tushie.
It warms your wipes great just when you get to the bottom they are dried out.  We use ours everyday and they still dry out.  But having warm wipes to clean her and wash her off when we are in a hurry definately outweighs the dried out wipes at the bottom.
I purchased this for my 8 month old son.  He really does like it and it seems to keep him occupied.  There is one major flaw.  The seat does not rotate very well.  He certainly can't do it on his own.  I end up spinning him around which kind of defeats the purpose have having a swivel seat.  I believe if there were more rollers and they were larger the problem would be solved.  So far so good other than that.  Took me about a half an hour to put together.  And it is so cute!  I drive a VW, so I just love the "bug" design.  And the vibrating "start and shift" is hysterical.  Very cute.
My 1 year old daughter uses one of these when we are sitting outside. It really keeps her busy. When we have a garage sale she can sit right next to me and play.
These cups are GREAT because they are not the traditional spill-proof sippy cups that you find everywhere! THANK YOU First Years for making these as I haven't been able to find another good old fashioned sippy cup!! Yes a 'little' water comes out when the baby shakes it and bangs it around (it's really not that much), but she can actually USE them (she was using the other ones for teethers because she couldn't figure out how to get the liquid out). We have these and the Philips AVENT BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 9 Ounces (which is a pretty fast flow for a little one)... Our 3 other brands are sitting on the shelf collecting dust!More pros:Great price! I don't have to worry about losing a pricey cup at play dates, etc...Top rack dishwasher safeCup, top, and stopper (there aren't a million pieces to clean)Also recommend: The First Years Take & Toss 5 Count Spill-Proof Trainer Sippy Cups with Removable Handles, 7 Ounce
These sippy cups are fantastic. We love all the different colors and that they are space savers in the cabinet. We used these almost exclusively until she needed a bigger cup for daycare. I would recommend every parent have these.
My kids are 2.5 years and 1.25 years respectively, and both enjoy using these Take and Toss cups.  The lids stay on tightly and the liquid inside is easy enough for kids to drink out of.  There are no valves to clean, the cup itself is easy to clean, and the optional caps are great for capping the cup while in a bag.  This cup, however is not completely leak proof when on its side, and if you have kids who shake the cup while it's upside down, you will have drops of liquid coming out of the cup.  Thankfully for us, our kids keep the cups upright and are beyond the cup gnawing phase; these cups are perfect for our family.That said, this cup is probably not the best for beginning cup users or kids who still like to throw cups around, but are great for those who are just trying to learn how to walk around with a drink and may sometimes drop a cup by mistake.
These are great but will need to be replaced after a while. My daughter chews on the lids and after a while they will start to leak...I would not describe them as spill proof either-you will still need to watch out for leaks etc-but they are a good product for the price.
I've got piles of sippy cups for my daughter and collectively, I cringe to think how much money was dropped on all of them.  In a desperate attempt at finding something new, I grabbed some of these Take and Toss cups figuring there wasn't much to lose considering how cheap they were.I was very excited to see that they said they were dishwasher safe...meaning, they'll probably last just fine for more than one use.I've only had them a couple of days and I'm SO happy I got them.  They're working out great for my 18 month-old and it's great to know that if I'm ever in a situation when one gets broken, lost, or just gets all funky and gross, I WON'T feel bad about throwing it out!The only downsides to these cups have been mentioned in other reviews -- the lids are a little difficult to get on (but I remind myself this means my daughter will probably never get it off by herself) and they do leak if you shake them upside-down.Seriously, give these a shot before dropping $6+ on ONE sippy cup.  It'll save your sanity.
I bought these for travel because I figured we would loose several on the way.  We have managed to hold on to them relatively well.  We don't use our insulator ones anymore.  We stick to these.  They don't leak, they are a good size, and they are lightweight for little hands.  I'm happy with them and recommend buying both sizes.
I was getting sick and tired of buying those expensive sippy cups worth 6-8 dollars and the valves would end up getting lost/broken in the dish washer. I was fed up and I needed something better that wasn't expensive and I am so thrilled I found these. My daughter is 16 months old and loves to throw her sippy cups and so far we had no issues with the lids coming off. I love the part that there is just a lid and no valves to pop in.These are great in the car, for travel and in the highchair. I went back and bought the 10 oz cups.
The nice thing about this chair is that it's pretty cheap and folds up very easily so you're not lugging around a whole bunch of parts.  It is very easy to set up and put back together and easy to clean.  Our son sits well in it and doesn't scream or anything in it either so that's a huge plus.  It is very compact which is a nice plus for traveling and space.  I like being able to attach it to other chairs and being able to get it back together in no time without any help.  That's a plus if you're traveling alone.  I'd highly recommend this for any mom who loves to travel.  It definetly has its perks.
The fold and go booster was our initial attempt in the art of portable boosters. We had fallen in love with a different brand that our friends had, so we ran out and got this thing. Mistake.Plus side: will hold a child upright while being fed.Minus side: straps do not detach easily for cleaning. Tray is not fully adjustable. Bottom feet prone to collapse. Chair falls apart.Seriously, we were taking it apart to wash it, and the cheap plastic buttons holding the back on broke. This is the second portable we had to scrap. There is still a lot of engineering that needs to be done on this model.
My in-laws live far away, and they bought this chair for my daughter to use when we stay at their house.  She has been able to comfortably sit in it since about 5 months old.  The extendable straps are great, and I've had no problem attaching it to a number of different styles of dining chairs.  I think my daughter feels like she is included more with the adult diners when she sits in this chair versus when she sits in her highchair at our home.  It really could be used as a permanent highchair.  The only reason I am not rating it with 5 stars is because the lid to the storage compartment on the back always swings open when I try move the chair, and has even fallen off a few times.  This storage compartment is useless and has always been a nuisance for me.
Great! Lightweight, easy to store, easy to open, can be packed in a suitcase, left at Grandma's house. Tray can be a little snug since there is no way of making adjustments to it. But then again, if you child is big enough they can just push up to the actual table.
I don't like to leave negative reviews, but I was so bummed to use this and not get a great result.  Also, the wood on the frame is so crappy that the back was cracked in two places when I opened the box!  The &#34;clay&#34; looking material is a foamy type of material and is always malleable (stays gooey even when dried) and it is quite difficult to get a good impression when you pull your baby's hand or foot away.  It sticks to the skin, so it takes quite a few tries, which can be frustrating with a newborn.  I loved the idea of this product but it is quite cheap, and i'd rather splurge for something else.  Wish there was something else out there...
I bought 2 of these frames to give to the grandmothers for Mother's Day from my 17 month old.  She has tiny hands, so they fit fine (although I wouldn't recommend it for kids her age with larger hands, definitely designed for infants).  My only real complaint though is that the backgrounds that it comes with are either pink or blue.  Am I the only mom that's sick of everything being pink or blue?  What about green, or yellow, or purple?  So I went out to a craft store and bought a sheet of solid scrapbook paper to use as a background instead.
The frame itself is just okay, but the easy to put together footprint and photo for grandparents made it worthwhile.
If you mess up your clay, call the company and they will send you more free of charge.  I have used these for each of my children and I love how easy it is to capture their tiny foot prints.  I only had to replace the clay for one out of three kids since I messed it up.  It is forgiving and you have many chances to re-do the print if you want.  Follow directions and you will have a great impression after a few tries.  Do not strive for perfection or you will hate this, but a great print is possible.  I do this when the baby is newborn so I can fit two feet in the clay.  Not easy but doable and the results are priceless.
Turned out nice. Not clay like other things I got but works nice cause this foam does not crack like clay. The print didn't stick I'm frame but a little super glue fixed it. Good for gift too. Quality is pretty good.
While I didn't have the problems others had with a broken frame, I was still very dissatisfied with the quality of the product.1)  The blue background is so light that it looks more like a blueish grey than blue, the pink was fine but we were going to use the blue side.2)  The clay is a horrible item to use for this purpose.  The instructions tell you to roll it in aluminum foil. It stuck to the foil and repeatedly stuck to my son's foot (see additional uploaded photos) regardless of how thick or thin it was rolled out. What finally worked was to roll it between wax paper, let the clay dry for 5-10 minutes after you roll the material before you try to make an impression (this was not included in the instructions).  I only found this out after we had already made about a dozen attempts and decided to use the scraps to experiment to make a hand print. Because we re-rolled the clay so many times, lint and dirt started to get embedded into the clay resulting in an unattractive print that we didn't want to frame.3) I would have expected a little form to keep the clay in a nice square/rectangle, cutting it with the supplied ruler was also a mess that stuck and deformed the print.  After a day, the clay still did not completely dry and has the consistency of the stiffer marshmallows from Lucky Charms (firm but will dent with pressure).4)  There is nothing special about the frame except it is thicker.  To attach the clay they include double sided tape.I would not recommend this product.  For the price you can easily go to a craft store and procure the same materials and have a much better end result.  Personally, I would use artist clay to make a foot/hand impression first and cast that in plaster.Update: 30 November 2011I contacted Pearhead regarding the difficult time we had with the clay and that it was embedded with lint and stuff from being re-rolled. They responded in less than 12 hours and said that they would send out more clay to us. I originally rated this product as a 1, but because they had excellent customer service I wanted to upgrade my rating to between a 2 and a 3.Update: 02 January 2012Since my last update, they did not send replacement clay. I have since emailed the company two or three times and have received no response. I now would like to reduce the rating of this product to a zero if that were possible.Update: Jan 2013It seems that they did not like my picture I had uploaded of my newborn son's feet stuck in the clay gunk and pulled down the picture from the site. Instead of fixing the product or providing customer service, it seems that they prefer to hide the imperfections with the product so that more people will buy it.
This bag is nice because it isn't an shoulder bag like most baby bags. Here I can put the strain on my body.. not just one shoulder. It has plenty of room and is stylish.
This monitor is decent for the price, I guess. But I think I would have rather spent a little extra to get something a little better. The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds. But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up. There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!  If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter), then the monitor is pretty crystal clear. The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!). So, if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night, or every other night, then I guess this monitor would be okay. But if you have that kind of money, I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one. I think I am going to return this for something a little better.  I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually have such great quality products. I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.  My suggestion: don't [spend] your money on this monitor.
I received the GRACO dual receivers as a baby shower gift.  This monitor was not very good.  It had so much static.  It did its job, so I kept it.  However, I refused to take it with me traveling.  I travel to Indiana because my younger sister lives there.  She has a two story house and when I would put the baby down I couldn't hear her cry from downstairs.  I went to the store and found this monitor.  It was only $20 so I figured if it worked even half as well as the GRACO it would be okay.  Let me tell you, it is great.  I could hear the TV in the next room.  I could hear the fan rotating.  I could even hear her roll over.  On top of that, I could see her larger movements with the lights.  When she cried all the lights glowed.  I was tempted to take this monitor back home with me and bring the one I have in my house to Indiana my next visit.  This is a great monitor, don't be fooled because it is cheap that it isn't good.  It is great.
Well I purchased this monitor over a year ago when my son was born last November 2002, and I have had no complaints. The monitor does have background noise when you turn it on, and I only use the AC Adaptor, but it works well for my needs. I can hear my son if the volume is down low, and the lights work great. I haven't had a problem with the static, and it's one of the most economical buys out there. So far, Fisher-Price has been a company I have bought many baby items from. So, although others have only had short term luck with their monitor, I highly recommend this product , and I've had it for over a year.
I like the items this kit contains. They are all helpful and can be used until your baby is a toddler. The only thing I don't like about this kit is that there really isn't a handle to hold it with and it is kind of bulky but other than that its great. The nail clippers and tweezers have a magnifying glass on them which makes it much easier for clipping babies nails. I would recommend this product to others.
This kit represents overall good value in terms of the contents, since a single digital thermometer costs ... It could include a scissor.However when we first opened the hard plastic case, half of the contents fell out, since they are not secured inside it.  Additionally the case is difficult to carry by the handle (there's no hole) and is not securely closed. Not to mention its bulkyness.We returned it and bought Nursery and Bath Care Set by Summer Infant Products. For additional [money] you get a few more extra items, all secured in elastic loops in a compact pouch.
I registered for this thinking it would be great.  Everything I need.  RIIIIGHHHTTT.. haha.. The only things in it I can use are the nail clippers (but I cannot use the magnification because it distorts everything and I cannot see my sons nails),  the hair brush which is nice, the comb which is nice, and the nail files which I dont like anyways because the chalkboard scrapping sound lol.  The thermometer [stinks]!  It doesn't beep so you dont know wen its done.  You have to watch for it to blink or something like that and it only blinks a few times so if u miss it ur gonna sit there for a LOOOONNG time but hey it takes a long time to work anyways.  The medicine dropper is TOO hard to pull out and push in. And the tweezers are very flimsy
You don't have to worry about your kid getting these out of the outlet since it's nearly impossible for you to get them out of the outlet.  They lock in securely and require some serious effort to remove.  Great for peace of mind!
I love this product - highly recommend for the mommy and daddy who have busy body babies that cant stop touching everything!
Finally, an outlet cover that my 18 month old can't figure out how to remove!
These along with the Safety 1st Adapter and Plug cover (for outlets in use) are the ONLY thing that stops my toddler in his tracks.  I tried your cheap flat plug covers, which he gets off in three seconds flat.  Then I tried the convex style Munchkin brand covers, which he actually got off BETTER than I could due to his small fingers.  He's a smart kid.Despite the bad reviews, I decided to try these.  They work.  He can pull on them all he likes, but he doesn't think to use the two-step release system.  He got frustrated in about 30 seconds and never messes with them anymore.  I think they may have improved the product or something since the reviews started.  Definitely give it and/or the Safety 1st Adapter and Plug covers a try if nothing else seems to work and you have a little tinker on your hands.
These are good and safe, exactly what they should be but, if i had known better i would have bought the sliding ones with the screw.
These will definitely keep your little one out of the outlets -- highly recommended for safety!  However, I have weak hands and can't get them out w/o my husband's help.  If you have similar issues, you may not want to use them in outlets that you need to use frequently.
It takes both hands (and adult hands at that) to get these back out of the outlets again.  And that's exactly what we wanted -- something impossible for babies to remove and a very appreciated pain the the a-- for adults to take out as well.  Great product, Satefy 1st!  I'm ordering more this week for the rest of the house!!
Yes, they are difficult to remove... that is the point, of course.But they break easily upon removal.Only use in outlets you have absolutely no intention of using until after your child is old enough to know not to stick anything in them.
We purchased these along with some cheaper plugs.  We installed these on outlets that we use often and they are a breeze to remove.  So far, our child hasn't figure it out, but we're worried these will not work as well once she's older and may switch to the cheaper ones.
These did not work for out outlets. Possibly because we have an older home?? The latch that is supposed to hook on to the plate isn't long enough so it doesn't grip and they pull right out.
My 18 month old son easily pops off all the other plug covers but cannot get these off. They take a couple seconds for me to get off but not really a hassle.
Since the first time my daughter noticed the outlets she has been obsessed with them. That's why I got these ones for her room  and the living room, where she spends most of her time, and got the simpler ones for the rest of the house.They are hard enough that she can't take them out, but not too hard that I can't remove them with one hand.
I was a little concerned about getting these after reading reviews from people who struggled getting these plugs out of the outlets. But, glad I decided to order them- they work like they should- making it difficult for little hands to pull out of the wall.  Yes, they do take a little work for an adult to remove- you have to kind of wiggle them out-but it is pretty simple. Overall a great no fuss product at a great price!
These work well keeping people out of the plug. A little to well actually. It hurts my fingers trying to pry these out of the outlets. If it's an outlet you don't use much then these will be a great product you won't have to worry about kids getting into.Might want to get something else if it's a heavily used plug.
These seem like the best outlet plugs money can buy.  They may be a little hard to remove when you want to vacuum, but there is no way your baby will get them out of the wall socket.  I am very glad I bought these!
I bought a bunch of these for our house based on the reviews that said they were impossible to get out.  I'm not sure if we received a defective batch or what, but some of them stay in, and others can be pulled straight out and wont lock in no matter what we do.  Very disappointed in the outlet covers, as we are probably going to have to replace them with a different kind.
These actually snap into place and are a little difficult even for an adult to remove but will keep a child from removing.  You have to squeeze the two size buttons and depress the top button at the same time.  Two handed operation.
There are a lot of products like this out there.  I think people should get a few and see what works for them.  This works for us, as do a number of other products.
I know the point is to make it hard for the little ones to reach the outlets, but once these are installed there is NO getting them off without destroying the darn thing! We had to use pliers to wrench this thing out of the outlet, and by the time it came free, it was completely destroyed. We tried multiple ones from the box and they are all the same (we had hoped that the first two were just defective). BEWARE! We almost broke the outlet trying to get these little buggers off.
No worrying about toddlers or even pre-schoolers figuring these out...very well made and they do their job.To open them you have to depress the top button, then pull down towards the floor a bit and out. It takes a few minutes of practice and some finger strength for adults to get it right, but there is absolutely no sense in installing the 'other' outlet covers that can be ripped out of the wall then choked on by a baby is there? I've also had a few of those 'other' ones snap off inside the outlet, which really was a treat..should not happen with these plugs.So if you want safety these are the plugs to get. Been using them for nearly 5 years now and never have my kids come even close to getting them removed. I personally was nearly electrocuted as a child, having stuck my parents car keys into a socket...trust me, it only takes a second for a life threatening incident to happen with your child. Why take chances???Pick up a few extras for grandma's house too.
I suppose first-time parents think that this is the best collection of baby necessities available! But, what first-time parents don't realize is that you'll get the most important of these things from your hospital when you leave after having baby! I've volunteered and had children at several hospitals in several states, and the going-home kit always included a nasal aspirator, a little brush and comb set, a bunch of alcohol wipes to care for the umbilical stub, a shampoo scrub brush (not included in this set, but fabulous, especially for cradle-cap babies), and a little baby nail clipper. What's included that is unnecessary:emery boards/scissors: baby's nails stay soft for most of the first year, to the point that you can just peel off the overgrown part of the nail easily, without having to contend with a wriggling baby in one arm and a sharp implement in the other handmedicine dropper/spoon: should your baby require liquid antibiotics, the medicine will come with a syringe-type applicator, which you place into baby's mouth and then press the plunger to dispense. Use a spoon? Baby will swat it out of your hand and you'll have pink and white stains everywhere. Use a medicine dropper? Very slow and you have to keep refilling the bulb. Your baby's meds will come with the dispenser, so these are unnecessary.temperature tester: very very inaccurate, especially since babies are still not quite self-regulating when it comes to body temperature.digital thermometer: do yourself a favor and register for an ear thermometer. It will last much longer -- years! -- and can be used for an older child as well as a wriggly, sick baby. Believe me, baby will not quietly say AH and put the thermometer in his mouth when he feels awful... and just try putting it in the other way!toothbrush: bristles are NOT recommended for children under 2. Instead, toothbrushes that have rubber tips/points are recommended, to massage teething gums and be gentle on new baby teeth.Don't waste your money buying this kit. Get what you can as a gift fro your hospital, invest in a good ear thermometer, and get one of the sets of grow-up-with-baby toothbrushes that "at a baby store"
This kit has all the essentials. Great for travel. Roomy case to add first aid stuff. A must have.
This is another must, I LOVE the brush and the nail clippers, they are perfect for her little fingers and she loves chewing on the handle of the tooth cleaner.  Perfect for teething Lol
to all first time mothers: this product is really not necessary! i bought it and im only using daily the brush and the nail clippers. I bought another thermometer since, this one wasnt very reliable, and all the other things are not really necessary.
This is a fantastic kit to give any new parent.  A friend of mine just had a kid and received this as a gift.  They've been keeping this in the car for when they're visiting or just out and about.  It's got all the essentials, including the ones you might not think to pack.
This kit is great. It has everything in it you need for basic hygien of a baby plus it's convenient for traveling. The price is good, the brand is good, the products are good, just buy it already!!
I registered for this item and it arrived while I was in the hospital. I was so relieved to find it when I got home. I'll admit that not all the items are necessary, but it is still a fabulous kit. All I came home from the hospital with besides my son was an aspirator and ointment for my son's circumcision. The brush and comb are obviously highly useful. The nail clippers are my favorite even though I did get several pairs with gifts and such. The adjustable and extra long handle is great. The scissors and aspirator have also been handy. I never used the alcohol wipes or emery boards. I haven't used the tweezers yet, I just haven't needed them, but I'm sure the day will come.I used one of those rubber finger toothbrushes until my son was about 9 months old, but when he bit clean through it and bruised my finger we switched to this toothbrush. (my son was a fairly early teether and was cutting his molars by then). We're now on are third toddler toothbrush and he's not even 2 yet. The temp tester has been used since his first tub bath at just a few weeks old and still is. I've never had any problems with it being variable or unreliable. The digital therm. has been great. I've always used it to get an underarm temp. not an oral. I was told by both my son's doctor, her nurses, and the workers at Babies R Us that the ear thermometers were less reliable unless you got a hospital quality one, which is not what is available in the stores. I haven't used the medicine dispensers because most medicines come with their on droppers but if I ever loose one or have to throw one away for some reason I can because I have these reusable ones as backups.Overall I think this is a great kit for new parents and I'd recommend it to anyone.
My favorite items are the nail clipper (which you can actually hold on to), the water temp (much easier to read than the one with the tub), and the brush (nice and soft). A lot of the other items I've found pretty useless to me. We're about to go on a trip and the portablility (case) is great.
My baby is 4 weeks old, I have not yet used a thing from it. Regular adult stuff is more useful and better quality.
This is another one of those nice looking set geared towards new parents/  You see it and think you need it all and it will all match and be in this neat little case when you need it.  But the truth is you won't need most of it.Let's start with nail care.  The clippers in this set are adult size with a neat little handle added.  Well adult size is too big to use on those little bitty hands...that is why they back infant sizes.  Those nails are also so soft the first couple of years that you won't be able to use the scissors or files on them.  I ended up using the files and we use the scissors to cut tags off of new outfits.Then you have all medical stuff.  The nasal aspirator in this set doesn't work.  None you will ever buy will work as well as the one they give you in the hospital.  Keep all the free stuff from the hospital because 99% of it is better than what you can buy.  This also goes for the thermometer.  They will be taking your babies temp frequently after birth and they use a digital unit similar to this one but better.  The one we got at the hospital works in 3-5 seconds.  Another reviewer said to get an ear unit.  Don't waste you money.  They are inaccurate and the doctor will not take readings form them.We still haven't used the medicine spoon or dropper.  If you child needs medication it will come with a syringe which is quiet frankly easier to use then a dropper.  And at 14 months our daughter still can't take any medication from a spoon.  Our doctor said that usually doesn't happen until 3 years of age.Then there were the tweezers in this set...in 14 months we still have not figured out what these things are for!  You've also got the toothbrush.  It's far too big for a toddler mouth and you can't use it until they are at very least a year old.  the bristles are also more like that of an adult toothbrush.  So this was added to our stash of cleaning brushes.So what have we used of this set...the brush.  The comb still makes her cry (it scratches her head) and gets tangled very easily in her curly hair.  But we use the brush every single day.  We also use the cute little case to store all the junk that came with this kit that we've never used.So all in all, take everything the hospital gives you and buy a brush because the rest of this set is useless.
So rarely can you find everyone you need all in one product.  This is one of those rare occasions.  This set is the most complete one on the market and there will be no need to supplement it with anything else. The large handles on the items (especially the clippers and scissors) are very handy so that you don't have to worry about slipping and accidentally cutting your squirming newborn while trying to do those ever-important nail trimmings. The thermometer is also a great addition if your child's bathtub doesn't already have one.  The purple color is great and it all comes in a great carrying case complete with an important information magnet that you can stick on the refrigerator for baby sitter's etc.  I am thoroughly pleased with this kit.
This is definitely the set to get. It includes everything you'll need for baby well care in a convenient storage pouch. I tend to leave things all over my house but with this kit I never have to search for tiny items. All of the pieces I've tried so far work very well also. The clippers are my favorite since they are very easy to handle. The scissors work for nails as well. The brush is excellent....very soft bristles for my daughter who doesn't have much hair yet. Nail files and alcohol swabs are nice extras. The bulb syringe works better than the one from  Gerber that I have and the thermometer was a cinch to use as well. I have yet to use the medicine dropper or water temp taker but I doubt there is anything wrong with those items. I also have to wait for my daughter's teeth before I test the toothbrush but it's nice that I have everything handy already. I love this set and keep it clipped on my nursery cart. It also comes with a useful book on taking care of your baby. Definitely the best kit with the most baby essentials.
I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talkinga bout. We registered for this set and got it as a gift.  I have used NOTHING from it.  The green suction bulb is so hard I can't possibly get it to compress with one hand - its useless for suctioning babies nose, we used the one from the hospital.  The same thing with the dropper.  The tweezers were so hard to handle, I just used mine.  The brush and comb are okay.  The nail clippers are too difficult to see what you are doing and so I end up cutting my daughter's fingers - the nail scissors are too dull to cut her nails.Overall, this is a cheap set and I wouldn't recommend it.
I put this on my registry and received it at my shower.  I have been pretty pleased with it as well!*At first, I didn't think I'd need the thermometer because I also had an ear thermometer, but my child's pediatrician said they aren't accurate with newborns or infants, so I've gotten plenty of use out of it as an under-the-arm thermometer.*I didn't like the bulb syringe at all... it's not very flexible.  I much prefer the one given to us at the hospital.*The nail clippers work great!  I use them quite a bit since my son's nails grow so quickly.  Some say to just tear the end of the nail off, but I'd hate to accidentally get it tearing into the nail bed!  Ouch!*I won't use the medicine measurer anytime soon thanks to the little syringes the hospital gave me, but once he's bigger and takes larger doses of medicine, I'm sure they'll come in handy.*The brush is pretty soft, but his hair isn't long enough for the comb yet.I think it's a great set, but this is the only one I have and I haven't checked out any others.  I'd definitely recommend it with the fact that you won't use everything at once in mind.
I received this set as a gift.  I do agree with one of the reviewers you get some of the items in the hospital, however, we didn't get all of the items and when you're a new parent pressed for time, it's awfully convenient to have everything you need packed into one kit.The one "add on" that we put into the kit ourselves was a digital ear thermometer.  Other than that, it had everything we needed.It's great for travel, and the items are well made and attractive in appearance.  It would make a terrific gift.
everything you need, daughter loves it... baby probably hates it, lol... good to have more than one of these sets.
My 7 month old wants nothing to do with these... she would rather try to hold the bottle without the handles.
I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent. Go from Avent bottle, which these trainer handles fit on as well (we started out putting the trainer handles on my Grandson's bottles)to the Avent TrainerCups
These do just as promised, and we started using them at three months when we switched to bottles exclusively. The first day we used them our girl clutched on with a little help, and through one year she would play with them and hold on while eating. Better than a smooth bottle to learn how to grab on. We have since bought the "training cup" or whatever it's called from Avent, and I was happy to see that these handles transition to the cup, too. It's always nice when a product has a longer life, especially when it's for babies!
We took a chance on the &#34;colors may vary&#34; and lost... got pink for our son. I took them into Babies R Us for store credit, but unfortunately neither BRU or Buy Buy Baby had these in stock... :( Hopefully I'll find them sonewhere else soon, as I really wanted to have them for his sippy cups.
I wouldn't go a day without these when my daughter had a bottle. I think these have to be the best things made for bottles. I never had any troubles with leaking or anything. (I expected it, but was surprised). If I ever had anymore kids (which I'm not), I would get these again!
My son is starting to hold the bottle himself and these handles are a big help. I love that the Avent bottles I am currently using can grow with my son and turn into sippy cups. What a great idea!
These work perfectly with the avent bottles but you need to buy spouts too. Then you can use these as sippy cups.
This frame is perfect for a small shelf/area.  Very neutral so it fits every decor. I highly recommend it. :)
it is such a beautiful and stylish frame. I expected smaller size and was gladly surprised that it is a medium size. Looks great in a baby room.
This is a nice frame. It's heavy and definitely suggests quality. The lines and edges are smooth. It's detailed and has a lot going on, so it definitely will be eye catching even amongst other frames, and also looks good just on its own.The finish is definitely more pewter and not at all silver. That's fine with me - but just wanted to clarify for anyone wondering.
This keeps the odor at bay nicely, but unfortunately, when you add another dirty diaper you end up smelling all the old ones. However, besides the smell that hangs around the nursery for a little while after changing, the Diaper Dekor has kept the poopy smell at bay throughout the summer, with minimal air conditioning in our home. It's nice that the bag can be changed at any time since there isn't a pre-set size; so if you get a stinky bunch of diapers and the pail isn't full, you can still empty without wasting extra plastic. This is very user friendly: refills are easy to insert, bags are easy to remove when full, and you can even use it as a regular trash can when that glorious day arrives when your little one is potty trained. When taking out a full bag just remember to leave enough plastic to tie it off with!
We got the dekor plus after using the small dekor for 10 months. The reason we changed it is because the inner lid stopped functioning properly. We had the old square model where the inner lids in the pail are round and fold to the inside of the pail (that is the model in this picture). We bought the dekor plus at babies r us. The diaper dekor plus now is oval and the inner lid is square. It now has a system to cut the bag on the inside of the pail, which is nice, and it has a lock for the inner lid of the pail. The lock is necessary because in this model the odors linger if you don't lock it, hence it is not hands free as it is supposed to be. Since we bought the dekor plus it is bigger, but since the smell keeps getting out we have never even allowed more than a day's diapers -5- to stay in there. If you want this product get the old square old version, which is the one in this picture. I guess that is the one reviewed by consumer reports and recommended. The new oval version does not work as well, also get the smaller size model -the dekor not the dekor plus.-
This is a great diaper bin. It operates great and seems to be well constructed. I have been using it for 2 weeks and so far I love it.
We used this with the plastic refills for the first few months while using disposables & then switched to using a planet wise pail liner when we started cloth diapering. I love it! It is a little awkward bag removal using the plastic liners, but the fact that you can decide how big to cut the bag is smart. Very rarely do I catch a wiff while putting a diaper in.My only complaint is for cloth diapering it could be bigger. It doesn't hold all the ones I use before needing to wash so now I have a hanging planet wise bag in addition & the 2 of them are enough.It's nice enough looking that I would use it for a regular trash can someday when we're done with diapering ;)
You can use regular kitchen bags with this one! I works great and I love that you can lock it. Changing the bag smells, but any trash can would. It keeps the odor in, the only thing is it has to be changed a lot.
We love the design, but it doesn't contain the odors.  We use the biodegradeable bag refills in it...not sure if that has anything to do with the smell issue.  We love how easily you can change the bag whenever you want and how much you can stuff into it.  Putting in the refill takes a second or two to figure out, but once you do it the first time it's really simple.
This diaper pail keeps the smells in, while allowing you to cut the bags and throw them out whenever you want!
We got the Diaper Genie as a shower gift.  I think they were the first to come out with a diaper disposal system, since the name "Diaper Genie" is to diapers as Xerox is to copiers.Unfortunately, the Diaper Genie is a terribly designed product (this from an engineer).  It finally broke on us for good a couple of weeks ago.Enter the Diaper Dekor...This thing is really honestly and truly hands-free.  I'm serious.  You drop the diaper in and you're finished.As emptying it, it's as simple as trying to knots.  Trust me, it takes 30 seconds maximum to empty it.  We haven't had to load a new refill, since these refills last as long as 5 of the Diaper Genie refills.As for the great odor debate, we found it to be slightly less odiforous than the Diaper Genie.  Let's face it - leave dirty diapers in a warm room for a week or more, and it WILL smell.There IS one poor aspect to the Diaper Dekor - you'll read about it in every review...  The door that you open to empty it is NOT child resistant.  In reality, it is a child-magnet.I found a clean solution to the problem, but it is a shame we have to do this.  Go to Home Depot, and buy a roll of the BLUE painter's masking tape.  It is in the paint section, and looke like a roll of masking tape, but it's blue.  Buy the 1 1/2" width.Put a strip over the recessed knob, and the kids won't be able to open the DIaper Dekor.  The reason you want the blue stuff is that it can be pulled off and WON'T leave any sticky.You could also simply put the Diaper Dekor on a shelf, and use your hand to open the top lid before dropping in a diaper.Either way, this gets 4 stars compared to the 0 star Diaper Genie.
The Diaper Dekor Plus has been pretty good for containing the smell of our baby's dirty diapers, but I'm skeptical of how it'll be once she's eating solid foods.  As others have mentioned, this is essentially a traditional step-action garbage can, with an additional door/flap to hold in the smell. That flap helps a lot - it means that as the lid is opened, it isn't pulling "dirty" air up from the can's interior, so that definitely cuts down on the odor spread.The biggest issue we have with it, however, are the refills - they don't last the longest and they give no warning when they're about to run out.  If you're not careful, this could make for a baaaad day - the refills come as a long tube of bag which you pull down and tie on the bottom, cutting the top and retying it each time you want to empty the bin. If you're lazy and don't pull the newly tied/clean/empty bag section down all the way, you might not realize that there are only a few inches left - which will cause the bag to fall to the bottom, open, when the contents get heavy enough. That's bad on its own, but if unnoticed, you could easily fill the container, without the bag in place, and have a nasty, smelly surprise waiting for you.  It hasn't happened to us, but it came close.The fix would just to be to have some sort of warning/indicator to show when the refill roll is about to run out.  Of course, if used as per the instructions, pulling the bag all the way down when changing it, you shouldn't have a problem.  Doing so, however, is easy to overlook.
I got this after reading reviews for several different diaper pails and I opted for this one since I didn't want to stick my hand in anything or twist things. Pros: easy to use and change the bag. Cons: the smell! Every time I throw a diaper in there, the 1 second it takes for the diaper to enter the compartment is enough to release a foul odor! And this happens even though my little one doesn't poop much and has barely started on solids. It does not, however, smell if the whole thing is closed and unused. Only smells when you toss a diaper in.Also, if you want to throw away just a diaper wipe, you can't because the 'trap door' requires pressure (from the weight of a used diaper or your hand) in order to enter the trash compartment. You gotta make sure your used diaper is wadded up tightly because that helps it break through the trap door (with light or barely used diapers, you'll have to probably use your hand to push it past the trap door. I've had to do this several times). I'm disappointed since this performs as well as a regular trash can with a foot-pedal operated lid, which is what we were using before.
I highly recommend this diaper pail.  We love the ability to take out the trash anytime, and the ease of getting to the bags and replacing the bags.  We have also put regular trash bags in when we have run out the refills and that works great as well.  This is one of the only diaper pails I have seen that would have a life beyond the baby stage.
We are very pleased with this diaper pail. It does a good job of containing the odors and accommodates a large number of diapers. However, the thing we were most impressed with is the simple yet efficient disposal system. It's really neat and well thought through. Also, we like the re-usability aspect as a trash can for later. Highly recommended product!
I can't say enough about the Diaper Dekor Plus system.  It truly holds as many diapers ODOR free as they say it does.  Our son is 3 months old and we've only just opened a second bag a couple of weeks ago!  (Each box of refills contains 3 bags, but they include one bag when you purchase the Diaper Dekor Plus.)  At the rate we are going, we won't need to open another box of refills until close to his 6 month birthday.Don't let the price tag worry you - it's WELL worth the price because there is absolutely no odor.  With two dogs in the house, we worried that the diaper can would become a hunting ground, but they haven't shown the least bit of interest.  The bag is a cinch to dispose of, and I LOVE how you can cut it off at any point you want.  In the long run, the refills are much cheaper than the other brands and it's well worth the money to not have to waste your time on flimsy grocery-store bags - they simply can't contain the stink - find another use for them - line your other waste pails with them.  Diapers need special attention, and the Diaper Dekor Plus fits the bill!I HIGHLY recommend this stylish, practical and cost-effective disposal system!
I couldn't be happier with this pail.  I researched pails all over the internet and I would have loved to purchase the $90 steel one but logic set in and I realized I could get this pail with 2 cloth liners for the same price!  The pail feels chinsy when I move it around but you can't really ask for much when you're buying plastic.  I put this in my room because he is still a newborn and that is where he sleeps.  We were using just a wet bag and my room went from smelling like dirty diapers (I could barely be in my room)to smelling like flowers :)Overall, great product, no smell at all, works great with a wet bag!--So I've been using this for a week or so now and I have a better idea of how it works. Still NO smell which is awesome! My planet wise diaper bag fits perfectly but it is a little hard to get out once it is full, not to big of a deal for me.  Also since I know this would have helped me when i was looking for a pail I did a diaper count.  This pail fits about 18 cloth pre folds/fitteds, 6 covers, 18 cloth wipes.
We purchased two of these diaper pails in preparation for our son's arrival. We love that there is a foot pedal for throwing the diaper in so you don't have to open the lid with your hand. Unless the diaper is really light, we can usually just throw the diaper in, and the inner flap will open with the weight of the diaper. The inner flap can be locked if you have nosy toddlers or pets. Our 18-month-old son does lift the lid up sometime and opens the flap, but never tries to put his hands in. The refills are easy to install, and the bags are pretty easy to tie off and change. There is a built-in blade for cutting the bag when taking a full bag of diapers out. We generally don't have any problems with odor, and we take the accumulated diapers out twice a week. Sometimes I'll notice an odor on the day that we will be taking the bag out, but other than that, I think it does a great job of keeping the odor in.
We did alot of research on diaper pails and this one came out on top.  It's virtually odor free (though not always!) and sturdy.  We also like the fact that it can be used as a trash can later on.  Most importantly, the bags are super easy to change!
I got this diaper pail soon after my son started on solid foods. It has been very useful and easy to use. I have gotten a couple of unpleasant whiffs, but if you change the bag often, you'll have no problem. To all the parents who gave this negative reviews because of the smell, I'd suggest buying a couple packs of the disposable powder scented bags and a container of Febreze or the Clorox disinfecting spray. They work really well, especially on poopy diapers. I have had no problems with this and would recommend this to any new mother.
I could not imagine using a different diaper pail in my house. I did so much research when making my baby registry on this piece of equipment for her nursery because there are just so many options out there and so many people with different opinions. Let me explain why I love this system the most:- Foot lever to open the lid makes it easy to keep one hand on baby and drop the diaper in without a hassle.- Lid to the diaper storage area takes minimal effort to push it down and drop the diaper in, but it is also LOCKABLE for when baby gets older and starts to "explore" their nursery.- Top lid drops down securely and so you actually have two barriers between the bag of diapers and the air of the nursery so I've never smelled anything.- Inside there's the never-ending stream of plastic which serves as the diaper bag and I have found this to be so effective, when it comes time to change the bag I can compress the diapers and cut the plastic using the inside cutter to maximize the bag use. (See note below for comment on bags)- Stylish design makes it very un-obtrusive in the nursery. It didn't come covered in bright colored, garish stickers and advertisements. I was able to take it out of the box and immediately start using it. It also came pre-loaded with diapers!- Compared to the Diaper Genie which you have to press the diapers through a tight seal (and diapers can thus explode all over you) this is so much better and easier to use. My husband is very happy with it and not bothered at all in using it. I've had friends (and especially friends' husbands) complain about the diaper genie because of the issue of having to press the diapers through a seal.Side note: I highly recommend using the original refillsDiaper Dekor Plus Refills 2 Packbecause they do a lot to help with the odor control. TheDiaper Dekor Plus 2-Pack Refill Biodegradableis not as effective, I think because of the different plastic they use to make them "biodegradable".Overall, I'm completely satisfied with it and so glad I did all of the research I did!
We have enjoyed the use of this product for our son. The foot pedal is the main reason we chose this product. With a squirming child, being able to use one hand for diaper disposal is a plus! We have had no issues with odor. I also love the economical practicality of the refills. The fact that you can choose how much of the bag to tie up makes it user friendly and saves money. In the nursery, it looks like just a waste basket instead of a "poop disposal unit" as my husband calls it. I can't say enough about how easy it is to change the refills and empty the bags. The double doors are easy to push the diaper through and keeps your hands and the unit clean. Do yourself a favor and give this one a try, you won't regret it!
beware, as your child ages, this system does not hide the odors.  We have twins thus, two bins and the rooms that the bins are in STINK!  I am replacing them.
We've been using this for two and a half years now and with two kids. We really like the system of tying off the bag whenever you want to, whether it's 3 diapers or a dozen. The only time I smell anything is when it's pretty full and I open the top to put a diaper in, or on those rare occasions where it's super full and we haven't emptied it in a while.
I waited a long time before writing this review because I wanted to put this thing through its paces both with a newborn and with an infant eating solids.I have to say that I couldn't be more pleased. Its extremely easy to use (hands free) and the liners last a long time and are very easy to put in. My son is 6 months old and we've used the liner that came with product, plus two more. Thats with me being lazy and not wrapping the diapers tight and also putting regular trash into it. We can get anywhere from 15-30 diapers in it before it needs to be emptied, depending on how tight I roll the dirty diapers.We've not had a smell issue, even though this kid can really make some stinky ones! We went on vacation for 2 weeks and forgot to empty it before we left. I thought for sure it would be dreadful, but nothing... No smell at all.I've tried just about every other diaper pail out there... between my MIL daycare, stores and friends. I would still stick with this one, for sure.
We got this as a shower gift and we also have a genie for our second changing area.  The dekor is in my daughters bedroom and is completely odor free.  The genie is also working and odor free however the genie is a pain to use.  The dekor is just a step and go system, the genie has the lid, the twisting and re sealing ;at 3AM this is a total pain!  To change the liner is also much easier with the dekor.  I would suggest this to everyone.
I purchased this product just before my son was born, and saw it merely as a minor convenience item. I had no strong feelings about it. 5 months later, however, I LOVE this product. It's small and sleek, so not at all an eyesore in our very minimalist nursery, but it is also VERY functional. It's easy to use, keeps odor to a minimum, and refilling it is a piece of cake. We're even buying a second one to keep in our playroom.If I had to come up with a criticism, it would be that in order to get the full storage benefit (since it has an oblong shape) every once in a while you have to jiggle the whole can back and forth to make sure the diapers are distributed evenly and not just piling up in the middle. Other than that, I think it's perfect.
I have used different diaper disposal systems at friend's houses.  The only one I have no experience with is the Diaper Champ.  I feel that the Diaper Dekor is one of the best on the market right now from my experience.  I have mine full to the brim and so far have not detected any odors and I am not hard of smelling.  I feel that if a diaper system smells then there is no point in purchasing one.  You could just buy a cheap Rubbermaid trashcan instead.  This one looks nice and is easy to use.  I am very glad I received this as a shower gift.
My baby is 8 months old and we've had this since she bas born. The refills last a long time, it looks nice in the nursery and it doesn't smell. I would recommend this to anyone.
Highly disappointed in this diaper disposal system.  For the price, you would think that it would seal each diaper individually.  The less expense models (even the Wal-Mart brand) will.  We chose in the end to just have a small garbage can in our daughter's room and a natural scent deodorizer in the bottom.  The bag gets emptied daily and there are no smells of diapers in her room.  Much less expense option and works the same as this system!
Yes, it comes with starter bags... if I remember right, the first starter, bag lasted about 6 weeks - I cant remember if it had one or 2 refills with it when we bought it, sorry. And, this is a great pail to use for something else when you are finished using it for diapers... I plan to use it in my master bath room when I'm done with diapers... It would be perfect for tolitries and other items in the bathroom!!! No odor, no mess, and very very easy to change the bag. Just one snip with the siccors and tie 2 nots (one in the top of the used portion - and one to close off the new portion) ---- That's it!!!You can even change it wile baby is sleeping. Since there is no loud popping noise of opening a new bag (you just pull the next portion down) my baby sleeps right through it!!!
We got the Dekor and the Diaper Champ as gifts and kept both for the two changing areas in our house. I like the Dekor SO much better because of the foot pedal for disposal (my son is super squirmy and I need both hands for him!) and changing the bags is simple--just open the front door, cut the top of the bag with the built in safety cutting device, knot the bag, and pull down the plastic for the next bag. The refills are expensive, but they last a long time, especially if you "wrap" the diapers up and secure them well with the tabs to save space. I would have no hesitation recommending this for anyone!
I love the Dekor plus.  I loathe the diaper champ.  My mother and sister use diaper champ and I have the diaper dekor plus.  I get mad every time i have to use diaper champ.  The dekor has a foot pedal which is awesome!  when it is full you can still set a diaper on the opening and it will fall in when you change the bag.  With diaper champ you have to plan ahead and pull open the unit or you have a dirty diaper in one hand and have to leave the baby to use your free hand to open the champ.  Champ will NOT EVEN open if it is full so now you are struggling with dirty diaper in hand and loose baby.  It is very subpar.  With dekor you just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in or set on top if full.  It is so much better.  You can also choke off the bag when changing to not get the full smell whereas diaper champ you have to lean over the stinky bag.  I love Diaper Dekor Plus, replacing my mothers champ with a dekor now...
After checking out all the different kinds of diaper pails we decided to go with this one. We love it!You only need one hand to throw the soiled diaper away. As for changing the liner, it is very easy. When I saw that the refills cost about $20.00 for 3 bags I thought oh my gosh. But they last such a long time that it is very worth it! My daughter is 1 year old now and we've only had to buy maybe 4 refills so far. I'd say that is very good!The diaper dekor does not allow any odor to stink up my daughter's room. Unless you leave dirty ones in there for a few days. We take them out probably 3 times a week, and that works great. I would recommend this pail to anyone.
This is an excellent diaper pail!  It looks and works like a regular trash can - just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in.  No twisting or other fancy maneuvers necessary.  The refills are very simple to replace and when it's time to empty the pail, all you do is cut the bag, tie a knot and you're done!  Although it is small, it holds a ton of diapers -- so far we only have to empty it about once a week.  The refills are a little pricey, but a 3-pack lasts several months.  You definitely want this one on your registry!!
This diaper pail was great when my daughter was a newborn and her diapers didn't have much odor. Now that she is older I have realized the (1) it doesn't hold that many diapers and (2) it DOES NOT CONTAIN THE SMELL AT ALL!!!!!! Look elsewhere for a diaper pail
Great design! Love the continuous bag that reduces waste and gives us control over when to empty. Trap door keeps odors at bay and sleek design looks great in the nursery. Got it right on my first try. If you are a new mom trying to figure out what diaper pale to get, look no further. This one will serve you well!
This really does keep all the smell in.  I only take this out once it is FULL, and you can't smell it in her nursery at all.  I did read several reviews that the biodegratable ones aren't quite as good, so I have only used the original ones
My toddler is just over 2 years old and I've been using this pail since he was born. We live in a small condo and his room is quite small as well. Even with that, we never, ever have had the house - or his room - smelling like used diapers. Even when the pail is completely full. The only time I smell that is when changing the bag (so it's wide open) or if it's overfull and one of the diapers is holding open those inner flaps. Otherwise, nope. No smells. And yes, this is a child who is home with me all day (so, unlike another reviewer said, no, the lack of smell is not because his diapers are going in a daycare's pail!), and, like I said, he is over 2 now so his poop has gotten - um - fragrant. Until he's toilet trained I will continue to use this and I would absolutely use it with another baby. Fantastic at odor control.My complaints - minor - are the latch, which as others have noted is a bit flimsy and takes a bit of fiddling sometimes to get it to stay closed (not always easy with a 2-year-old trying to "help"!), and as someone else said, it'd be great to have some marking toward the end of the refill so you know when it's nearly done.  VERY minor complaints, though, and certainly wouldn't keep me from using it again, and didn't keep me from giving it 5 stars.
This thing works! Keeps the smell inside, super convenient, easy to clean out and replace the bags. I'm very glad we got this, I don't know what would we do without it. (Those diapers are quite smelly, believe it or not! =)
Don't fall for the Diaper Genie hype. This is an EXCELLENT product - it doesn't waste plastic by wrapping individual diapers and it still smells great. Our daughter can be "stinky" at times but we've never had a problem with smell. Replacing the bag is simple and the in-door cutter is so helpful. I highly recommend this diaper pail.
I'm sooo glad that I bought this item. It NEVER stinks. I don't know how it holds in the smell of my boys diapers, but it does. I think I cram a good 40 diapers in that thing too to before I empty it out. It holds many more diapers than the average diaper can/disposal system. I only change it every week and a half to two weeks. It took me about 90 days to use up my first refill. I like the fact that I can buy refills online and they come in the mail.I buy the refill packs of three. My boy is 4 months old now and we are only on the beginning of the second refill. I think that the price was fair for such an attractive and well working system. BEST OF ALL the bags smell like baby powder, so when you're changing out the bags, you smell baby powder, not poopoo. Most important! Refills are only available in Babies R US or at Babies R Us online. Be sure that you buy "diaper dekor plus" refills for the diaper decor plus. I accidentally bought "diaper dekor" refills. Oops! Had to exchange them.
I did a lot of research and decided to register for the Diaper Dekkor+  It is a wonderful product.  We have the Diaper Dekkor next to our daughter's changing table in the nursery and we have not had any problems with odors.  I love the one handed easiness of the product and the bags are simple to change.  I only have gripe, and that is you do not know when the bags are coming to an end.  Other than that, this is a wonderful product and highly recommended.
Basically all of these diaper pails don't really contain the smell all that great but regardless, we've changed the bags constantly sometimes twice a day but the nice part of these type of bags is you cut them off wherever you want to so you aren't wasting an entire bag. We keep this in the bathroom because after a while it stinks - we are on our second one - the first lasted us a year and then it smelled so bad even after being cleaned extensively many, many, many times we just threw it out and bought another one. We've tried others as well and have concluded this one is the best and by far the easiest to use (just step on the lever it and throw the diaper in) - I want the least amount of interaction with the contents as possible and this diaper pail fills that bill. p.s. Here is a tip: buy a Stick up air freshener and stick it inside the diaper pail (on the wall of the pail where the diapers go) this won't completely alleviate the smell but it will help and also spray it frequently with lysol.
Works perfectly well - keeps smells out.  Also much cheaper than the Diaper Genie option.  Doesn't take up much floor space and very easy to use.
After reading dozens of reviews on other diaper pails and checking them out at the stores, we decided on the Diaper Dekor Plus for when our son was born.  We have not been disappointed yet.  The refill that came with the pail lasted until my son was almost three months old.  There is no twisting or flipping involved (nice for arthritic users).  You just step on the toe-button or lift the lid by hand and drop in the diaper.  The only time we have any smell is when the bag is full and ready to come out.  Since my son has been in daycare, we only have to change the bag out about every 6 days, and it's only at that 5th or 6th day that there is a slight smell.  At the suggestion of another reviewer, I put a stick-on air-freshener to help with that.The one time I had to replace the refill was easy.  To change out a bag is easy, too:  just knot the bag, cut it with the cutter, and knot the bottom.  The only slight thing I noticed is that we cannot use the foot mechanism (toe-button) to open the lid in our son's room due to the carpeting (which has a high pile).  It worked fine on less "fluffy" carpeting and on hard flooring, and this was not a large issue for us.  We were much more interested in the limited number of times we need to replace the refill and the stink factor.One other thing I really like about this is now that my son is getting taller (longer), it's hard to have the poopie diaper sit on the changing table with him while still continuing to clean without him kicking a foot into it (since you want to wrap up the poopie wipes in with the diaper), so I've begun setting the diaper on the top of the lid while I finish cleaning and re-diapering my son.  Then I grab the diaper off the pail, wrap it up with all the used wipes, and toss it in.  I wouldn't be able to set the diaper there with most other diaper pails.
I am dumbfounded. I have two sets of twins, 8 Month B/B and 3 year old B/G. ALL of them LOVE this toy. My older twins enjoy making him a "baby". And giving him kisses amd making him do all kinds of tricks. They could do this with almost anytoy, but the ADORE pupsqueak. That Said I have 2 others wich I gave to my boys. They LOOVVVEE him too! I was amazed. I dont know if its just because hes a dog, (their lovey toys are a black and white dog and a brown and white dog, and they love our boxer and golden retriever mix) or maybe its just because PUPSQUEAK ROCKS! They love it when I attatch him to their carseats, They just got "big boy" carseats and pupsqeak of course had to make the transition too! A few weeks ago we went on a 8 hour car ride, I know that my youngest twins stayed quite mostly because they were soooo comfy in their marathons, and because they had... PUPSQUEAK! They had the option to play with other lamaze toys, which they loved but those just dont compare to pupsqueak. They even like him in the crib and in the stroller, a versitile little toy. And A toy that for 12 bucks will last THREE YEARS, wow talk about getting a bargin! Pupsquek is definatly NUMBER ONE FOR MY LITTLE BOYS! Well maybe number two, but no one ever beats their loveys Puppy and Doggy!
Our 4 week old son LOVES this toy!!! He loves to look at it and touch it. Everytime he sees it, his eyes light up. Its very bright, with high color contrasts ( which babies love). I give this toy 5 stars!!!
This toy is very sturdy and easy to clean.  It also comes with a multitude of sounds, textures and colors, which has kept our son interested since the moment he laid eyes on it.  The only downer is that the recorded barking noise that plays when you press its nose is a little loud, and can sometimes jolt/scare a baby.  We've never been disappointed with any of the Lamaze line of soft toys and Pupsqueak is no exception.
Right around the age of three months, my daughter started to really become interested in the things around her, and Pupsqueak was no exception!  She absolutely loves this toy and we take it everywhere we go.  I can lay her on the floor with this and she will move it back and forth, grab at it, and pull the ring into her mouth.  She absolutely loves the sound the ears make.  A great toy to teach your child grasping!
My son loved this! We'd clip it on his Crib Bars, on his gymini, and on his Stroller! He loved playing with it and it washed wonderfully as well. In fact we bought the cat as well since he loved it so much! :)
I loved the Avent nursing pads when they used to be made in Switzerland.  They were soft and comfortable.  With my current baby I purchased the Avent pads again but found them to be rough and itchy.  I looked on the box and they are now made in China.  I prefer the Johnson's and Johnson's brand.  They are soft and made in France.  Not much more expensive than any other brands.
I have tried several types of pads and these are the worst! They are very small, thick, and do not hold much, causing them to overflow and leak. I'd recommend the Gerber pads.
I am continuing to nurse my baby at 17 months and have found these pads incredibly useful and comfortable.Pros - very comfortable, easy to insert, not too fat and therefore are less visible under clothing than other brands. They prevented leakage very well in the first few weeks after my baby was born and now continue to provide comfort and reassurance!Cons - they don't stick very well - but better than other brands that I have tried. I particularly have a problem at night as they really don't stick at all to my sports bra but at least they are still in the bra by morning whereas other pads disappeared completely. They also fall apart after about 20 hours if you forget to change them - then you do have to watch out as the sticky bit tends to turn into little sticky bits which can get stuck to your breast and therefore into your baby! Also the cotton padding will just start to leak and shed.Overall - I have been and continue to be very happy with these but as with all pads, you have to change them regularly and be prepared for movement!
These are some of my least favorite from any brand I've tried.  They leak for me.  Won't be ordering again.  :(
I've tried the washable breastpads and they're no good! You soak right through them. The Avent pads were relatively inexpensive and work wonderfully! I buy the 100ct two boxes at a time.
I have tried a few different brands of nursing pads as I am now breastfeeding my second child.  These are by far my favorite.  They are just softer and more absorbant than other brands I have used.  These factors are really important especially in those first few weeks when nipples may be a little bit sore and there is a lot of leaking.  I would give a 5 stars, but with a thin shirt on these are somewhat visible.  To me this is a completely worthwhile trade-off to have soft, comfortable pads.  Quite frankly, I am not wearing tight shirts in the post-partum period.Madela pads were less visible, but much less comfortable and less absorbant. They were too thin and plastic-like. They absorbed very poorly.
i found a sample pack of these in the bathroom, and after using them once, i would not waste money on them. too small and too thick. not very comfortable. lansinoh is the best i've used.
I used to use the Avent pads until I discovered the Lansinoh pads.  The Avent pads are thick and smaller and they show through your shirt.  It's hard to disguise that you are wearing breast pads, which is kind of awkward.  I also found that it tends to move (slightly) even when attached.  It's okay to use at night because it is thick and it prevents leaks especially around morning time.  But I prefer Lansinoh and that is what I use now even at nights.  They are much better than the Avent pads.
I love these breast pads! As a leaky mom I've been ordering these from the start. They are thick and comfy. I don't use the sticky pads so I can't comment on those. I've tried many other breast pads and these are by far my favorite. I love that they're not individually wrapped because I find it annoying to have to unwrap the pads one by one every time I need one. These are the best pads for the money!
These nursing pads are a bit thick, so they tend to show under tight fitting tops.  I love using these around the house and at bedtime when I need them to last a bit longer.  The sticker doesn't adhere very well to the bra, but I find that sticking them makes it harder to nurse
I have used all the major name brands, had lots of samples and use whatever other mom's buy for my showers until I run out, plus I am on my third baby. All the brands of pads work fine for me, Johnson's leave fuzzies on my nipples but work fine otherwise.
i dint have a leaking issue with these but they didn't stay in place well. the one little strip of adhesive was not enough to keep them in place. Maybe it is b/c I am big breasted but these did not work (loved the Avent ones though)
These childproof doorstops stopped my 1 year old from pulling all the stops off and from the potential choking hazard of the little white caps on standard metal stops.  They are easy to install (I'm a woman and did it myself), as they just screw into the old doorstop's hole.  EASY!  Plus, they look great, and I prefer them to the metal stops anyhow!  At this price, you should be able to replace all the stops in your home!
I liked these at first but now I don't like them as much because my 3 year old sometimes likes to step on them causing damage to the trim they are screwed into. They cannot support the weight because they do not bend. I've also had one break, but the main issue is the damage when these get stepped on. Keep that in mind. It would be nice to see these in a flexible design but I'm not aware of any. Also, I wouldn't call these "soft".UPDATE 2010-02-10: Had another one break... so at least two have broken now. I have removed some other ones because I think they would cause more damage/risk than their worth if my son were to step on them or "play" with them.
This was great to keep my toddler from closing his bedroom door and getting up to no good.  It would be even better if it had a velcro attached to it so that you could attach it to the wall or a door when not in use.  I just got some velcro and did it on my own.
Out toddler and cats constantly removed the tops to our standards door stops.  Not only was this concerning from a safety/chocking standpoint, it was also quite frustrating finding them missing.  We replaced all of our standard door stops with these and the problem was solved.  It was super easy to screw these in to the existing holes.
My son, then 9 months, received this walker along with a playskool walker for Christmas.  The playskool walker has since been banished to our garage.  The Fisher Price walker is so much more fun!  My little boy is walking now, but he still likes pushing it back and forth across the floor and riding on it.  Even my 2.5 year old likes to sit on it and pretend he's &quot;going to work&quot; :)  This is definitely on my list of my top 5 favorite toys that we own!
My daughter loved this toy.  It wasn't used much as a walker, it was kind of difficult for her to walk behind it.  Now that she is walking she does like to sit on it and ride on it.  She enjoyed the balls and music before she was walking and it was like a transition for her from the kick toy with same balls for younger infants that she used.  The familiarity was also good for her going from one to the other.
My son got this toy for Christmas. He wasn't even crawling yet but loved to put the balls in the basket to make the music start. Once he started pulling up it was a great walking toy. He loves to dance to the music now. It is a little difficult to change from the walking to riding position but my son isn't that interested in riding right now.
We couldn't live without this monitor.  I have used this monitor every day since I brought my son home in March of 2005.  It has been an essential tool in looking after our son.  He's 2 1/2 years old now and recently made the switch to a twin bed.  With a minor adjustment to the camera angle, we are able to observe him in his big bed.  When he slept on his tummy at 3.5 moz, this monitor gave me peace as it was necessary to watch him very closely when he couldn't roll over.  I've kept it on my desk and night stand, carrying it from room to room, and I plan on purchasing the portable monitor for our new baby who is arriving shortly.  I have not experienced any technical difficulties with the monitor with the exception of periodic static if I stand several feet away at a particular angle to it, most likely interferring with the signal somehow.  I have never experienced any compromise of the clear picture when it sits near my head on the night stand.  I spoke with Summer Infant customer support today at (800) 268-6237, to determine if it is compatible with the new hand held color monitor I will be purchasing for our new baby, and they are very helpful.  They encouraged me to call them with the number on my original unit, which would allow them to determine compatibility.  I purchased the portable monitor for my best friend and she has found it extremely useful over the past 4 months since her daughter was born.
I am one of those "psycho" first moms that just held on till the bitter end with the basinett. I was the only one not sleeping well my sons first night in his crib. So we went out and got this monitor and I am VERY happy with it. I keep the tv on it's side so I can see my son laying upright and not sideways and I keep it right by my bed. If I want to see him I just push the button and there he is. It is so clear I can see his smiles and depending on what color his pjs are I can see his chest move when he breathes. :-) The monitor is SO good I can hear him breathing!! If I were to be nit-picky I would have to say it picks up a little to much. If someone is to loud outside you can hear it on the monitor OR if a car drives by. BUT all I wanted was to hear him breathe and see what he was doing if he cried. I think this item is worth EVERY penny for the piece of mind it gives me. Now he can sleep comfortably in his bed and even through I can't roll over and touch him in the middle of the night I have the next best thing. Buy it and you will not be sorry.Oh and fyi we have two cordless phones in our house and 8 million other gagdets and nothing interfers with the reception.TOTALLY IMPRESSED. Couldn't live without it.HERE I AM A YEAR LATER ADDING TO MY REVIEW...We still LOVE this monitor and we are about to have baby number two and when I called the company for 60 dollars more we can add another camera and I can see both my boys on the same monitor... really great product and company.
I read the reviews on this product before buying it.  It seems it worked for some wonderfully and not so great for others or not at all.  The sound worked great but I could never get a picture at all.  I took it back to the store and they said certain brands dont work in certain homes.  I thought about exchanging it for another just like it but figured it wouldnt work.  I saw the safety first one and it was slightly higher in price but i knew my other regular monitor was safety first and it worked so I bought it and got it home and it worked fine.  If you want this monitor I suggest trying it out for yourself in your home instead of just reading these reviews because it does depend on how your house is set up just dont get your hopes up and be prepared to run back to the store to exchange just in case.
I can honestly give this 5 stars as last month I flew from Ca to Tn. and this held my daughter's infant seat( Graco Snugride), window shades ( side pockets) and 2 full bags of baby gear ( toys, extra bottles) that I had left at Grandma's last time because I had no room for them. I could have easily put in a pack of  diapers and been okay. It made it through the baggage claim without a scratch and I can see me using this for many more trips back home as we live far away from family.None of my things were damaged or dirty and I can feel better knowing my daughter's seat does not  have the germs from the traveling. I had my daughter in her sling and since traveling alone was easily able to get my 60 lb bag of luggage ( gone long time), this seat and carry her. I did not hurt my back and got the seat out while waitng for our ride, put her in her seat and took off the sling which I slipped in this bag all while alone!Andin less than 5 minutes...no kidding! A lady next to me said how amazed she was I did so so easily and quickly.You will not be dissapointed.....
This is great for travelling.  At the check-in counter the attendant actually thanked us for using it rather than trying to check in a bare car seat.  There is tons of room and I packed all my babies clothes and supplies, including diapers, in with the seat.  It was nice to have my suitcase all to myself.  I checked it in and it arrived in good condition.  Hint: I put all babies belongings in a large shopping bag since I needed the car seat for the trip to the airport.  On the transport bus I pulled the Travel Bag out of the shopping bag, inserted the car seat and then put in all the other things.  Worked great!
I had bought this right before we moved 1/2 ways across the world.  It was perfect.  We were able to fit out Chicco Keyfit and teh Graco Turbo booster in this bag.  It turned out that we needed an extra bag, so I took the carseat out and replaced it with the First Years reclining booster seat (for eating), a boppy and some clothes and had a ton of room.  For the price it did exactly what it was supposed to do.  The only thing that would make this product better is to have wheels and a handle.
Best sippy cup we've had! My baby started using those around 15 months, didn't have any problem switching to this sippy cup. No leaks! Very easy to clean!
I love this product . But what am I suppose to do with pink cup when I order blue . I live in England . No point to return it . It will take for ever . Soo not happy
I like this sippy cup but it came in pink and I specifically ordered blue for my son. I was not satified with this product because of this.
We bought 8 of these 1+ years ago (tired of washing the two we had) and they've withstood the test of time.  At least 3 are used daily and none are broken, the seals still hold even when tossed in a bag, and our daughter enjoys drinking out of them.  Of the 8 we bought, only 1 was girly pink with butterflies, and the other 7 were gender neutral.
Playtex sippy cups are BY FAR the BEST sippy cups!  I have used others by Gerber and Avent- which both leaked!  Playtex will never leave you scrubbing milk/juice stains out of your carpet- or your kids' clothes!The insulated cup keeps fluids fresher longer, which makes this the HEALTHIEST cup delivering optimum nutrients and nutrition for your child!  This feature is particularly nice if your child sips a little here and a little there- esp. MILK which spoils quickly.I have bought this cup over and over again- not because it has worn out, but because I want several for our home, grandparents' home, diaper bag, etc.VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT!
i purchased these cups and they are supposed to not leak (like all kids cups). well....they did leak...alot. if you turn the lid too tight, it will leak. if you turn it not tight enough...it will leak. Needless to say...they are garbage.
This is the absolute best price you can get on these Playtex sippy cups. We chose the Playtex after using soft tip sippy cups for a while. They don't leak, they're easy to wash, and the insulation helps keep drinks at temp (warmed milk or cold water). I noticed before I bought these that people complained about the colors (same with the straw cups, which I also ordered); it's not that big a deal! Unless you have major gender issues, you'll get some cute designs that may or may not match the exact image of your child's gender. For example, in two sets we got a navy blue space scene with red and while space stuff and a red lid, a multicolored dino scene with pale blue lid, a butterfly scene with most yellow and green with a pink lid, and a purple and green flower design with a green lid.
We have been using these cups for about a year now and continue to enjoy them.  I do agree with one reviewer that they do tip over regularly but luckily don't spill when this happens so you can't make that a true negative.  The insulation doesn't keep things very cool for long if outside the fridge here in Florida.  I also find it hard to get my hand down to the bottom when hand washing with a sponge.  Overall, my son is happy with the cup so we will continue to use them!
I orderd these cups believing I will get the dinosaur ones as pictured, but instead got flower ones. My son is not going to use the flower cups!
This is very easy to clean and lasting. Love to be surprised with the colors because you do not get to choose. if you really want pink for girl and blue for boy. this product is not for you.
We didn't have this toy for long because it would not clip onto anything. I bought initially for the carseat on the road, (can't have the bar up while driving) but it wouldn't clip on to the carseat. It also didn't clip on to his bassinet. There was no point in having this toy, so we returned the item.As other people said it would collapse easily.Instead I use the Lamaze: Link Along Friends. I clip those to the hood of the carseat while driving. He loves to play with those toys.
This is a cute toy, I will give them that. And I didnt realize until much later that it played music. But it doesnt clip to ANYTHING. We have yet to find something that this toy will clip too. It collapses on everything, it falls on her. We ended up taking the toys off of it and hanging them from other things. We could have done that with toys she already had. This was a waste of money.
Looks great, Simple, Matches with everything. Not too babyish, so you can use it for a long time. Perfect Size. Holds a lot of laundry. Easy to use mesh bag inside. Good price.
Great capacity, easily folds to stow away, sturdy, doesn't buckle with a full load of laundry, can lift inner mesh bag to carry the laundry, holds up well in the wash (no shrinkage/discoloration).  I like the neutral look, works well in the nursery - doesn't compete with the rest of the decor.  Would definitely buy again.  If someone wishes to jazz it up, the front buttons could be replaced with something more decorative and keeping with the theme of the nursery.
I just love this hamper for the fact that it's collapsible All the baby stuff takes up room. This product was able to fit into this tight space we had between the wall and crib. Although it isn't opened completely, you can still fit your baby's dirty clothes without any problems. The mesh netting provides ease when doing laundry - just pull it out w/ all the clothes in it and take it to your laundry room...no need to take the clothes out and place in a separate laundry basket. And the price is  reasonable too!
Easy to assemble out of the box...no brainer!Netting comes out of the hamper for an easy "laundry tote" you can take right with you to carry the laundry to the washing machine. And it looks great w/ just about any decor. Love it!
Originally I wanted one of the more decorative hampers but I am glad I went with this one. It is super convenient and easy to clean....think machine wash :-). It folds easily if you decide you don't want it out for some reason and it has an interior bag which doesn't collapse from the weight of a hefty bundle of clothing. It is also an ample size comparable to the majority of larger baby hampers. It might not be appealing to some beacuse of its plain look but I keep mine in the corner next to my crib. It is definitely worth the price.
I bought his because it was so simple looking, and and have been really happy with it. The removeable mesh lining is perfect for carrying the clothes from the room to the washer. It's just the right size for a baby. I wanted to buy another one for my husband amd I, but it doesn't hold enough laundry. This is the cutest and most perfect hamper ever.
This hamper is perfect for the nursery.  It holds about a load of laundry when its full.  It has a mesh bag inside that makes it so easy to take to the landry room.  Plus, when you don't want to use it anymore, it folds up.  It doesn't take up a lot of room either.  It's perfect!
I don't think I ever would have made it through my pregnancy without the help of my Snoogle!  Much to my husband's dismay, this pillow was a permanent fixture in our bed from about 20 weeks on.  This took the place of countless pillows and supported my body so that I could get those precious hours of pain-free sleep.  I recommend this to anyone I know complaining of restless nights when pregnant.  Perhaps it goes without saying, but Amazon had the best pricing.
I didn't have one of these with my first pregnancy and now I am wondering how I ever lived without it. I am a stomach sleeper and being pregnant doesn't really work with that. This pillow lets me lean far enough over to be comfortable and supported. I absolutely love it!
I was a little skeptical to purchase this pillow.  Since I am 6'2" I wasnt sure it was going to fit me.  When I received the package,I thought I was definitely sending it back. The package was so small! I'm glad I took a chance and opened the package - it poofed right up on the bed!When my husband saw it he complained that I was going to take up the entire bed. The pillow actually fits on my side of the bed (queen bed) and my husband hasnt complained since we got it.I have had it for about a week now.  It is very comfortable.  I have always been a stomach sleeper and when I could no longer do that, I resolved to sleeping on my back. Now that I am unable to do that (18 weeks) I am having a hard time sleeping.  I now find myself waking up with one hip on the pillow and one hip on the mattress, tilting me slightly to the side, yet still on my back.  I have found that to be very comfortable.  Really any position with the snoogle is very comfortable.The reason for 4 stars versus 5 stars...I wish there was a little more stuffing inside the pillow.  I find myself fluffing it to try and get it a little thicker since I am taller. Some reviews have said it has too much, some have said it doesnt have enough. I guess its personal preference.Otherwise, its a great pillow. I have used it to prop myself up in bed and that works great as well. I can see myself and the rest of the family using this pillow for quite some time.  (One other minor flow would be the white pillow covering. it can get dirty so easily. I beleive I am going to make a cover for it in case of it getting dirty)  Oh...and the cover is not scratchy for me. Several reviews said their cover was scratchy. I do not find mine to be so.I hope this has helped you!
this pillow has served me well for the last 4 months. my only real complaint is that it is starting to get squished and doesn't provide as much support as it used to, but it will get me through the next few months. maybe popping it in the dryer will revive it.
I cannot imagine how I wold manage without this product!! This is more useful in the last trimester of pregnancy like is 8th and definitely in 9th months.I found this product more useful after I had my baby... Very very useful!!  Helps a lot in giving a little extra support to the back, while breastfeeding or just holding the baby upright for burping them. (Its so comfortable that you can take a little nap during the nights while holding your baby for that little burp!!)You don't need to be pregnant to buy this.. Its a gr8 support for your back when you sit on your bed for reading or working on your laptop/ipad.(This pillow dose not come with a pillow cover. So,do not forget to buy the pillow cover.)This can be a gr8 gift too...
This product has a lot of reviews, and I was nervous about buying because it seems to me something like this will work great for one person and not another. I am so glad I did go ahead and spend the money though personally. I will describe me and my sleep position, because I think maybe if you sound similar to me you will love it too? First of all I have slept on my back all my life, now that I am 19 weeks I know that isn't a great idea and also it just isn't comfortable anymore. This pillow has allowed me to sleep on my side much easier than when I was trying to use three or four pillows in different places. It stays in place much better than using multiple pillows and makes me feel much more supported. I love the curls at the top and bottom! Also, this is really the only pillow I use at night, so though it is kind of a big thing, compared to using three or four pillows I feel free! I wonder if I will even want to stop using it when not pregnant anymore, its so comfy. Also, this is my first baby and I plan on having more, so I figure I will get my money's worth. Anyway, I am about 5'3, moderately curvy and busty and I have a lot of back problems pre pregnancy, and this pillow really meets my needs in a way I don't think a standard body pillow would do :) Hope this helps.
My wife bought this pillow when she was about 5 months pregnant.  She loves it.  But I think I love it more than she does.  Before she had the pillow, my wife was all over the bed when she was sleeping.  She would move all around in her sleep and usually had me hanging off the bed by the end of the night.  With this pillow, that has stopped.  She stays in one place, and she sleeps better.  Because of that, I do too.  It is also very comfortable.  When my wife gets out of bed before I do, I often steal the pillow and sleep with it.
this product is very comfy and i think will work well for me as i get bigger. I bought it hoping it'd help w/ my lower back/neck issues, but it didn't help too much. I stopped using it for awhile, but will plan to use it again soon.My only complaint is that the part where your legs go seems to go flat quickly throughout the night which causes my legs to ache.
Got this pillow after way too many sleepless nights.  I had been having alot of hip and back pain related to Sciatica and needed something to help me stay on my sides.  I love the pillow for going behind my back and keeping me from rolling over, but my belly isn't big enough to really use it on the other side.  I have tried this pillow sitting up for reading, and eventually for feeding, and LOVE it.  The only issues I have with it are right on with the other reviews ~ the cover is really hard to get on.  The benefits out weigh the negatives though!
I was skeptical about making this purchase but I desperately needed to get a good nights rest. I mean how much could it differ from putting a regular pillow in between your legs, right? Well I must admit it definitely made a difference & helped me get much needed rest. With this pillow I no longer spent my nights tossing and turning trying to get comfortable. It also helped alleviate my back pain that I had been getting. I'm a back sleeper and this made sleeping on my side easier and more comfortable. My only complaint is that after 4 mo. of use its starting to go flat in some parts. Mainly the head but I have fixed that my just placing a pillow underneath that part. Still comfortable and I have no regrets about the purchase.
When I first started researching pregnancy pillows, I decided against buying one, convinced it was an expensive gimmick. But as my pregnancy progressed, I was waking up in pain, and could not find a comfortable position. I am normally a stomach sleeper, which is impossible now, and sleeping flat on your back is not advisable. The baby continuously kicked me if I slept on my left side, maybe I was leaning on him. That left me with very little options for a good night sleep. My first choice was the U shaped pillow, but all of them seem huge, leaving very little bed space my husband! I decided on C shaped pillow, and I am very happy I did. I actually prefer facing the C opening, which gives my back great support, like a hug. I tuck the bottom between my legs and under my tummy for support. I am petite, 5.2, so this option might not work as well for taller women.I can finally sleep on my left side! Plus, you can twist this pillow into a million shapes to build all kinds of supportive sitting or reclining structures. I will probably also use it as a breastfeeding pillow. It's a little tough to position yourself around the pillow every time you turn over, but that is normal- it is a big pillow after all, and pregnant women are not that agile. Some previous reviewers commented that this pillow retained body heat, making them very hot at night. The pillow does retain heat, (don't all pillows do that?) but I did not find that to be a problem at all. I get cold at night, and found that this feature was a pro, not a con. If I get hot, I just kick the blanket off. I haven't tried to wash the pillowcase yet, so I can't say anything about the ease of putting it back on the pillow. Regardless of that, I am very happy I purchased it.An update. Some reviewers complained that the cover was very difficult to put on the pillow after washing.I just washed the cover, and had zero trouble putting it on. It is an oddly shaped pillow, so I would recommend aligning the pillow to the pillowcase, so the ends are facing the same way. Grab the pillow by the curved end, and put it in the end of the pillowcase. Then, start pulling the length of the pillowcase down the pillow, just as you would a stocking, making sure the fit is tight. As you near the opening, stuff the other end into the pillowcase. It should be easier, because this end is less curved and is much closer to the opening. As both ends are stuffed in the pillowcase, the area around the opening will bulge- just force it inside- and viola! The pillowcase is on! It shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes. I would recommend following washing instructions - washing in warm water on gentle cycle, and drying on lowest heat setting. Perhaps some reviewers shrunk their pillowcases, which is why they had so much trouble putting them back on the pillow.
Bought this in my third trimester, if you turn a lot during in your sleep, this is not a pillow for you. Because every time you change the position, you have to move the pillow the other way, oh my specially when you are already barely moving yourself, pillow is more like being hassle than making you comfortable.
Loved this pillow during pregnancy.  The small crook goes nicely under your head while the length of the pillow supports your tummy.  The sleepless nights I had before this pillow almost stopped immediately once it arrived. I just used two pillow cases to cover the pillow rather than spending extra money for a fitted one.
After having a very hard time sleeping during pregnancy and onset of sciatic nerve issues during my first trimester, I purchased this pillow. It is very good! I use another pillow below it for my head, and use the below portion between both legs and the edge to support my growing belly. The pillow is very comfortable, and I sleep better. It also provides back support. During the second trimester, doctors recommend sleeping on the left side. This pillow is great for that. Sometimes I turn over my back because sleeping on my left with my arms hanging out causes squeezing of lungs and makes it hard to breathe, so I tend to turn on my back a bit while sleeping which is not good for the baby. The back support here prevents me from laying completely on my back. I only wish the back support were a bit firmer, it would have provided more support. Also, having the lower portion between the legs causes a bit of strain since there is only enough to go between the thighs, since the rest of my legs are at a different angle it causes pain and strain. I use another pillow below this one between the legs but it keeps coming off, so that is the only change I would have preferred. Overall I sleep better with this than without it. It comes with a piece of paper with instructions on various seating and sleeping positions, the seating positions are not that comfortable.
I am 5'3" and I was 125lbs before my pregnancy.After I bought this pillow, I have been able to sleep very comfortably nearly every night. It provides the support where I need it. I use the narrower "hook" end to support my head and neck. The long body pillow part provides back support and prevents me from sleeping completely on my back. The wider "hook" end allows me to separate my knees. I let my belly hang out at the opening of the pillow. I've tried using the body pillow portion to support my belly, but it is not that comfortable for me and I find myself sleeping on my back.I've gotten alot of rest because of this pillow. The cardboard insert in the package also has photos of 5 other uses for this pillow, including nursing your baby. I am still pregnant, so I don't know if this pillow is useful for nursing just yet.But for pregnancy, this pillow is awesome.
Pillow well constructed and hits in all the right places and supports the baby bumpThe challenge is this:  when you want to turn over, it can make it struggle sometimesSo if you flop around a lot, not sure for you.  If you generally sleep on one side ir the other will work great
Whoever invented this deserves the Nobel Prize.. okay maybe not that prestigious but at least something of sort.  This was a life saver for me when I was pregnant. Being of petite frame, the pregnancy wreaked havoc on my back and my sleep. My husband researched around and alot of his coworkers who were mothers or was pregnant themselves suggested I get a Snoogle.Googled it and found it on Amazon with the best pricing (shouldn't be surprise at this point). Received it a week later and immediately used it that night. The Snoogle was totally what I needed. Not only did it supported my legs, because of it, it helped alleviate the back pains I was experiencing due to my growing bump. Snoogle eventually became my partner on the couch, in bed.. even in my office chair! It provided all the right support for my back and legs throughout and after the birth of my daughter, it also provided support to help me with feeding her.As my daughter grew and hit each stage of her life, the Snoogle came into play a few more times (i.e. supported her head for naps, elevated her for tummy time, acted as a cushion as she practiced sitting up and crawling on her own). This thing is a miracle I tell you! &#60;(^.^)&#62;
It seemed to work well for the first few weeks. Then I started having pain in the neck and shoulder. If you could ask someone to take a look at your neck and spine, you would notice that they aren't in a straight line when you are using the pillow. The material doesn't contour to your neck and head. The pain went away after I switched back to my old pillow and using a pillow between my knees and ankles. The cover that comes with the pillow is made in a poor material.I bought this because I was a back sleeper and was desperate in finding a solution to help me sleep on my side. THE BOTTOM LINE: I won't suggest it to any one or buy it again.
I tried a couple of these types of pillows first.  The boppy body pillow (UGH!!) and a regular body pillow.My Snoogle is sooooooo comfy, I didn't want to get up!  I felt sooo relaxed.  All my joints were loosened up and my hip and shoulder pain is gone!!  I'm 5'7" and about 5 months preggo.  I'm an average size and this fits me perfectly!The only thing I would change is the cover.  It's a poly/cotton blend and it's rough and itchy.  I have a friend who sews and is going to make me a new cover out of better fabric.  Other than that, this is the best pregnancy product I've come across (and this is my 4th baby!)
Oh my goodness, when I was pregnant I was so miserable at night. I absolutely could not get comfortable, and I had incredible pains in the third trimester. I had extra amniotic fluid, which made my belly heavier than most people's, and it hurt so bad to roll over that I just wouldn't. I was desperate when I got my snoogle, but I was sooooo glad I did. I was still generally miserable, but I finally could get semi-comfortable and sleep. I wish I had gotten it sooner. I believe I had 72 days to go when I gave in and got it. I remember debating whether I could make it 72 more days or not. I'm glad I didn't try. The snoogle made sleeping so much better. Sooooo, soo much better. I used it for other things, too. It's a nice back rest when you do it like a cinnamon roll and stuff like that.I definitely recommend it!
I am pretty sure I did not sleep when pregnant until I got this!  Helps you to get into position for a great nights sleep, and have recommended to MANY over the years
I did not want to spend this much on a pillow. But if I had known how much it was going to help I would have bought it months ago.  Buy this today!
I used this pillow for my first pregnancy and fell in love with it;  I am a back sleeper and was often paranoid that I would hurt the baby while sleeping on my back after the 28th week (back sleeping is not allowed after a certain point in pregnancy according to my dr and all the books).  The shape of this pillow keeps me on my side which gave me peace of mind that allowed me to sleep easier.  I also slept more comfortably with a pillow between my knees so this Snoogle has it all in one!  No more 7 pillows sliding around in the night just one big pillow that you can adjust how you like it.Now that I am in my 2nd pregnancy I thought I didn't need the pillow because I forgot how great it was...  I broke down and used it 2 nights ago and am kicking myself for waiting so long to bring it out.  The only downfall is that it creates a barrier between my and my husband in bed but I can live with that for a good nights rest!  Don't deny yourself, it's totally worth it!!!BTW, I am 5' tall and do not find it to be too big for me...
i read a million reviews for a bunch of different maternity body pillows and decided on this one because it didn't look too big and i really wanted something firm.  i didn't want to pay $50 for a pillow that was flat.  my regular pillows are firm.when i received this item, i was shocked at how firm it actually was.  i used it for a while, in attempt to flatten it out a little so i could be comfortable.  but alas, i was NEVER comfortable.  nothing about this pillow was comfortable.  and i couldn't see myself using it to support my belly when i was REALLY showing because it was so firm, my belly would have been up in the air instead of level with the rest of my body.i don't know.  maybe if i was a larger woman, i would enjoy this pillow more.  i was 119lbs (pre-pregnancy) 5'5".  it was just a waste of money.also, it comes with a pillow case.  i didn't know that, so i purchased a sage one.  when i went to put it on the pillow, i realized there was already a white one on it.  so it was a waste of money.
This pillow was a life saver while pregnant.  I was having a lot of trouble staying on my side (I would roll onto my back) and this pillow helped with that.  It also made sleeping on my side more comfortable.  I highly recommend it.  I didn't use it for nursing the baby, but I have a friend who did and they said it was great for that as well.
I wish I bought this pillow for my first pregnancy! I was skeptical at that time but I remember how hard it was every night when I laid down, I cried because of the back pain! I'm 4'10" & 39 years old, the tummy is too big for my back bone & my age, I guess to carry so it hurt too bad... This time, I'm 43 & thought I should invest on all things that could help to make my pregnancy better! I tried this pillow & my bed looks better with only this long pillow instead of 7 ones like the 1st pregnancy. We share our bed with our toddler & we are comfortable with this pillow on the bed. It does work! I have no back pain like last time & I could sleep much better. I tried different positions the pillow can when I had heart-burnt or when I read books for my daughter before sleep & it helped a lot!I definitely recommend this pillow & its case (people said it's hard to pull the case on it after washing but I had no problem!)
This pillow has made sleeping during pregnancy so much easier and more comfortable.  Could of minor issues though... I didn't realize that the cover was removable so I used the pillow without washing the cover first.  I broke out in a rash on both arms for a day after that.  I'd HIGHLY recommend washing first (common sense, but again, didn't realize the cover came off).  Second issue is that the cover has already torn after just a couple of months of use.  I'll sew up the tear, but the quality of the cover that comes with the pillow isn't great.
Super comfortable and fits the body perfectly, every little nook and cranny was considered in the design of this pillow.
During my second pregnancy I was having a lot of trouble sleeping. I bought this hoping for support for my head & neck. Since I got this pillow I have been sleeping a lot better. I like the support that it provides for my head/neck/growing belly.I read some reviews that mentioned the pillow case was scratchy. I have not found this to be the case, although it is not as comfortable as my normal pillow cases. In addition, I have not found the pillow case as hard to take on/off as others have said. You just have to gather the pillow case & do it a little at a time.CONS: This pillow is big and bulky. My husband & I have a queen sized bed and this pillow takes up a lot of room. Turning over with this pillow is a bit of a chore as well.Other than that this has been well worth the money.
The pillow is quite large, which can probably fit for a person 6' tall. The shape works great with one side holding my neck well and the other side between legs. It does occupy quite some space, but not a problem at all for a king-size bed. The cover is white, which is easy to stain. Fabric is OK but not the most comfortable. Overall a good buy!
Before pregnancy I never slept on my side - and I really don't like side sleeping. The Snoogle has really helped me be able to sleep on my side or sleep on my back but with the snoogle under one side so I'm kind of propped up on it. Sleeping became really difficult in the 6th month and I am very glad I purchased this pillow. One caveat is that you NEED to buy a cover with it - I didn't realize that and ended up trying to wrap mine in a sheet until I had a chance to get a cover. The material is very scratchy and rough by itself: Amazon sells a Snoogle with Cover for $65, but since I had to buy mine separately I ended up paying $82.96 for the exact same thing. Bummer.I have found that mine kept its shape decently well - it's certainly not as soft as my feather pillows, but I was unable to find something like this made of down/feather. Overall, I would recommend this pillow BUT don't buy this one: buy the one that includes a cover at the same time!
I had gained 60 lbs during my pregnancy. Sleeping was very uncomfortable for the last trimester. This pillow was basically my only shot at a decent few hours sleep...
offers a lot of support, worth the money  - really good value - I like it better than setting up a bunch of pillows.
I had a Boppy pillow for the first 6 months of my pregnancy, but once I started getting big, it just wasn't cutting it anymore. This was recommended to me by a friend and it was literally the best pregnancy-related suggestion anyone gave me. I love that the pillow is designed to support the belly OR keep the back straight, so I could flip it around depending on where I most needed support. It is definitely big, so my husband and I didn't get to do much snuggling towards the end of my pregnancy, but a good night's sleep was worth the sacrifice!
I love love love this pillow, it is my new best friend.  For some the head portion may be a little high but I always feel like my pillows aren't fluffy enough so this was perfect for me.  And the label shows so many uses, I truly think I will use this long beyond my pregnancy.
I am always been a stomach sleeper, so pregnancy sleep was an even bigger struggle than normal.  I bought this pillow early on and couldn't sleep without it.  My belly rested very nicely on the pillow and placing the rest of the pillow between my legs helped position my body more comfortably.  My husband didn't love how much space it took up in the bed, though he would try to steal it on occasion.  Near the end of the pregnancy, it became harder to get in and out of bed with the pillow in the way, but I just kept the open side facing out, which made it a little easier.  I also found it comfortable to use either side as the pillow, so could easily switch from my right to left side while sleeping without (always) waking up.  Definitely recommend this pillow!
I was very skeptical to purchase this product but I did anyway. The first night was bad; My neck was stiff the next day. But I didn't want to return it used, so I tried it a second night. Much better and as I used it for the first week it got better. The snoogle does not go flat, and maintains its shape. It's not to firm or fluffy, but just right. You will need a standard pillow or two- one to wedge under your belly if you are a side sleeper and one to put under snoogle to support your neck. I found my head was lower than my body with just the snoogle which was the reason I had the stiff neck the fist night.  It is  very comfortable when rolled and used to prop up in bed. I love it now. But if I could go back I would buy the Cozy Comfort Pregnancy pillow ( hopefully that one maintains its shape like the snoogle)
I started sleeping better my first night with this body pillow. Before I had anywhere from 3 to 4 pillows taking up a lot of room on our queen size bed. Now I use this plus one other pillow I use for under my preggo tummy - I sleep with the "spine" of the pillow along the back of my body - always. It doesn't work well for me when it's in the front. I saved the box it came in so when we travel I can take it with me. It may seem a little excessive, but hey, a good nights sleep is worth lugging around a pillow whether it's in the car or on the plane.
I'm 25 weeks pregnant currently, and sleeping has become incredibly difficult, especially since I'm a back sleeper.  Sleeping on my side causes parts of my body to fall asleep, and while some of that may be because we need to get a new bed, I think most of it is because of pregnancy and I'm not in the habit on sleeping on my side.  Since sleeping on your back is a big no-no during pregnancy, I needed a little help - tried extra pillows, but I can't use too many or I'll be sleeping without a husband. When I saw the Snoogle at Babies R Us (for $69!!!!), I knew I had to have one.  Luckily, Amazon usually has the products I need for much lower prices, so I immediately put in an order for one.It came yesterday and I had the first restful night I'd had in several weeks.  I'm able to lay on my upper back, but prop my lower body up so that it's slightly on its side.  It also makes side sleeping more comfortable.  You can bend and fold the pillow in whatever way suits you.  Love it! Will probably use this thing even AFTER I'm pregnant :)
My God I love this pillow!  I didn't think that I would be able to sleep with a giant pillow like this but once I tried it, I couldn't give it up.  It took my husband some haggling for me to stop using it after the baby was born!  The only issue is that it would be very helpful if Babies R Us sold the pillow cases for it.  Since it is all white, it shows dirt easily and it is hard getting the white case on and off.It is an awesome pillow though!
I had more severe numbness and some hip discomfort with my second pregnancy. This pillow eliminated them  both! In fact, I slept so well with it, my husband would &#34;steal&#34; it for himself. He even slept better!
I am 24 weeks pregnant and have started getting uncomfortable in bed. I heard this was the best and most popular pregnancy pillow and I love it! It is definitely big but it's the only pillow I need and I can support my head, belly and legs with just this pillow. I didn't notice the fabric being scratchy at all. It's not silky super soft fabric, but it's just fine for me. And there is a cover on it so I can wash it which is really nice. I imagine this will be nice for breastfeeding as well.I highly recommend this pillow to help with sleeping and making things more comfortable! It's kind of like another person in our bed but it's worth it! It's also pretty pricey but I'm glad I bought it and I have loved it so far.
Bought it for my pregnant wife, who after just one night with it, was singing praises to the manufacturer and me for buying it.  Unlike some of the other brands that she's had, the filling in this pillow has yet to bunch up or go flat.  She used this daily for the last 4 months of her pregnancy, and still uses it on occasion.  It's big enough that she can rest her head on it and put the other end between her knees for the leg support.  She's 5 foot 10 inches, so this pillow should be large enough for most women.  We've had this for over 7 months and it still looks new.
I kept hoping that there would be a stage of pregnancy when this was comfortable, but it never happened. For how much space it took up and how difficult it was to arrange it never gave enough support.
I recommend this product for anyone, I will always use this pillow. Not only for pregnancy!  Wish I had found this long time ago.  I am 7mths pregnant and had trouble sleeping but this pillow has changed that, I sleep great now!!!!!!!!! Sleep is VERY important!!!!!! Worth the $. If you sleep with several pillows just order this and give hubby all the others, I did. And he is happy too! I don't take all the pillows anymore!! Sometimes I do put one of the flat pillows under head with Snoogle on top, if I want head to be up a little more. I can not say enough good things about this product.
I loved using this pillow. It made sleeping much easier, and I even kept using it for a little while postpartum. I still used a standard pillow for my head, but used this for the rest of my body and felt supported and less likely to roll around during the night.My main complaint was that the cover was difficult to replace after washing, and of course it's expensive. But it did make a big difference for me, which justified the cost.
I've been using this Snoogle pillow since about the 12 week point.  This is my second pregnancy and I knew how important a good body pillow was going to be so I didn't wait.  Last go around I used a Boppy body pillow, but I wasn't entirely happy with the way that one held up so I switched to the Leachco.  Overall this pillow has performed very well.  It is firm and holds its shape well.  I can fit the whole pillow in my standard size washing machine and it comes out fine.  My husband has already called dibs on it after the baby is born  :)  Fat chance I'll give up my "nest" anytime soon though.  I would recommend getting a second cover right away.  They are reasonably priced and it does make laundering more convenient.
I bought this for my pregnant wife.  And she loves it.  A lot.  Maybe too much?Let's start by saying that this pillow seems great.  She sleeps with it every day now, and she appreciates it more and more each day as her pregnancy progresses.  Functionally, she loves the way it supports her body, and continues to conform to and support her as her belly continues to expand.  It helps her to sleep comfortably on her side, and is flexible enough to allow her to shift positions and still provide support.How much does she like it?  We were staying away from home recently, and it was at the top of the list of items we had to take with us.How much does she use it?  Every night!Okay, so it can't be an all-positive review, right?Well, there are a few downsides:1) If there will be more than one person in the bed (like dad!) then make sure you have a big enough bed for Mom, pillow, and Dad!  In our experience, Mom, pillow, and Dad do NOT fit in a double or full sized bed.  Queen might be a tight fit for some.  But there is plenty of space in a king-sized bed.2) Depending on what side each person sleeps on, and the position of the pillow, Dad might find it tougher to get close to Mom.  If you've seen the movie "The Back-Up Plan" there is a scene in the playground where Stan (Alex O'Loughlin) talks to "Playground Dad" (Anthony Anderson) about the merits of the pillow.  It's not hyperbole.3) I can't comment on how the device might work out during hot summer nights.  During cold New England winter nights, extra pillows under the heavy bedding are fine, but I have no idea whether Mom (with her built-in furnace cranked way up) might start to get hot sleeping next to a maximum-contact pillow.  I tend to think, however, that the great comfort provided by the pillow would far outweigh any temperature related discomfort which might occur.Gentlemen: Buy it for the pregnant lady in your life.  She's love you for it!
I'm 5.5 months along and I couldn't of made a wiser choice when it comes to help my sleep condition. My back stays aligned, the bones in my knees aren't touching each other when laying on my side, and this HUGE pillow (caz it is huge) hugs me just nice and keeps me extra warm.The size: its huge ladies. I'm 5'4 and when I throw this thing on the bed my boyfriend says can you please hug me and not this thing lol. It literally is the size of a person. When I purchased it I threw it in the back seat of our small 4door car and it took up a good amount of space. We laughed.I recommend getting an extra cover for it, I did bc I use everyday and I like my things very clean. I'm having an extra cover made for it as well in 2 weeks in the material of my choice and fabric of choice since I'll be using it another 4.5 months. I can't wait for my new cover, yay.Forgot to mention it's also kinda heavy, yeah it's a pillow, but it's filled with some heavy stuffing and due to it's size of course it's gonna be on the heavy side.Your gonna LOVE it!-Liahni
My girlfriends suggested I get a body pillow when I complained of not sleeping well around week 18.  I looked around online and was going to get a basic one, when  I saw these &#34;fancy&#34; ones.  Then I read the reviews and laughed out loud at how many husbands had written them.  When I read Jordan B.'s review to my husband, he looked at me and said, &#34;Well, you heard the man, buy that pillow!&#34;  So I did.  (I think it was the Rancor reference that sold him.)The only &#34;issue&#34; you might have is maneuvering yourself around it when you're flipping sides in the middle of the night, or trying to get out of bed.  But tossing it onto the floor seems to work just as well as trying to climb over/around it.  I have even taken it on vacation with us.  And as an added note, the cat seems quite happy with it as well, so the whole family gives it five stars.
I've tried all the positions for this pillow.  And it just refuse to stay near my body contour.  I have a fit physique and about 14 weeks prego.  Like another review (that I wish I did not ignore), The fabric on this pillow is quite rough, which adds to the discomfort of using this pillow.  Who wants to hug a porcupine? So sad. I am not sure if the problems are 'fixable' because its my money down the drain.  For now, I am very comfortable with hugging a big pillow sideways and using a rolled up fleece blanket for back support.
If you're pregnant, buy this pillow right this second. I couldn't have gotten through my pregnancy without it. So comfy and helps me sleep so good!!
This saved my back during my pregnancy!  This is soooo comfortable!  I was a little hesitant buying it because of some of the reviews, but I am sooo glad I did.  No pillow lasts forever.  So if you expect this one to, you are kidding yourself.  But this one lasted me my whole pregnancy and is still usable for my next one.  I plan to still use it.  It is actually so comfortable that I thought I would have to get my husband one, cause even he loves how soft it is, and how well it supports your back.
This pillow was a pregnancy must for me! Early on I had decided all this pillows were silly and unnecessary but boy was I wrong! Great product.
I can't speak to the specifics of being pregnant, but I can tell you from a Dad's perspective that my pregnant wife really, really loved this thing.It's big. It's bulky. It takes up a lot of room in our queen bed. But all of that was worth it to try and ease some of her discomfort from growing another human.From that perspective I can't rate this high enough. Dads, don't hesitate if your wife wants one of these.
I didn't purchase this product from Amazon, I got in in a local store, but unless you just have money to blow on crap you don't need, do not buy this stupid thing! I liked it at first, but my baby isn't even born yet and I already hate this thing!It takes up way too much space on the bed, the pillow itself is so firm, it gives me headaches to lay my head on it all night. I should have gotten a small wedge pillow for a fraction of the cost. I paid $40 for the pillow, and another $20 for the horrible cover (which I did buy on Amazon, and wrote a separate review for).I could have gotten a body pillow from Walmart for $10, and a few pillow cases for a few bucks each. This thing is a pain in the butt and I can't possibly see how anyone who has actually used this thing on a regular basis for a few months would still like it.If you have the money to waste on something you might hate, be my guest, but I wish I'd never bought this monstrosity or it's cheaply-made cover. I'd much rather have my $60 back.
I am just about 6 months along now, and have had a lot of trouble sleeping since month 1. I don't know how I could live without this pillow! I don't think i'm going to be able to give it up after the baby is born! My husband is much happier now too, since I am no longer tossing and turning and waking him up. The pillow does take up a bit of space in our queen size bed, but it has never been in the way for him. Also the cover is really not too difficult to put on, I was able to do it in only a few minutes.Buy this pillow, it's more than worth the money!!!
Thank goodness I borrowed this- it's really not something I would want to waste my money on!!!!First of all, it's big. But that's not a dealbreaker, I can handle big. Not like my huge fort knox of pillows was smaller!  Other preg pillows are probably of equal size. But do note that it's a nice wall between you and hubby.  Also, the covers are TERRIBLE, always wiggling off and exposing the center of the pillow.The "C" shape presents an interesting question- put it towards the middle of the bed, or the edge? I chose middle, which means sleeping more on my right. But it's easier to get out of bed this way!The portion of the pillow which is supposed to go between the legs is really annoying- when you roll over (which happens), you need to untangle your legs from that part. What a BOTHER!I do like the curvature around the neck/shoulders. I find it very comfortable, but I think it contributes to sleeping on my back (which I find myself doing).All in all, I probably wouldn't buy a preg pillow, but if I did, I would either buy a big U-shaped one (which you would need to climb out of when getting out of bed), or the candy-cane variety, not the "C" shape. It just doesn't work for me....(Off note, I have noticed my sciatica is much better since sleeping with this thing. I'm not sure that's related or not- things change so fast with pregnancy!)
I had a rough first trimester with my second pregnancy and this pillow made sleeping a non issue for me.  Even when I was only 7 weeks along sleeping was hard because my stomach was uncomfortable and bloated.  This pillow supported my ENTIRE body and made me feel like I was being snuggled by a huge comfy teddy bear.  Now that I am almost 20 weeks pregnant and my stomach is much bigger, this pillow supports my stomach and back so well and keeps the aches and pains of pregnancy at bay.  After my baby is born I plan on using this pillow, and probably for the rest of my life even, it's just too comfortable.  I also sleep in a queen size bed with my husband who weighs over 200 pounds and we have no problems with this pillow taking up too much space.  I know some reviews of some pregnancy pillows say it's not appropriate unless you have a king size bed.
I was hesistant to purchase the Snoogle because it was so darn expensive. Did I really want to spend almost 50 dollars on a pillow? But when I kept tossing and turning and couldn't find a comfortable position to sleep in, I gave in and purchased the Snoogle. This thing has become a life saver! I've been using it everynight since being pregnant and I even take it with me when I need to go on overnight trips.The snoogle already has a cover on it that you can remove to wash so there is really no need to buy a slip cover. Also you can shape it to any form so it can be used to prop yourself up when reading a book or watching tv. I'm thinking it might even come in handy once the baby is here.
LOVE THIS PILLOW!!!  Pre-pregnancy, I was a stomach-sleeper.  At about 13 weeks, it became impossible to sleep on my stomach, and therefore impossible to get comfortable enough to sleep.  After reading reviews on numerous pregnancy pillows, I decided on the Snoogle because it looked to be the best item in the price range I was looking at.  After 2 months of use now, I could not live without this pillow!  It makes it easy and comfortable to sleep on my side; no more tossing and turning all night.  It is a big pillow; however, I am able to fit the pillow, myself and my husband easily in our queen-sized bed.  I use it not only for sleep, but I also fold it up and use it as back support when laying up in bed, which is an added bonus (it comes with instructions on multiple ways to fold and use)!  I can also see it being useful for feeding when the baby comes.  I do have two small complaints, the first being that after too much use in one position, it gets kind of flat.  However, it's nothing that a little 'fluffing up' can't fix.  The other is the cover it comes with; its white (easy to stain with any little trace of makeup) and a little on the rough side. However, those complaints aren't enough to make me take away a star.Overall, I would highly recommend this pillow.  It has been a life saver for me so far.  I will be purchasing this for all pregnant friends/family in the future.UPDATE:  I had to have an episiotomy when delivering my son, and the Snoogle pillow was such a blessing to have when it came to recovery.  It was very painful sitting, so I folded up the pillow and sat on it.  Because it is big, the height it provided over using a Boppy or other pillow to sit on was great.  Yet another use for an already extremely useful product!
Couldn't live without this pillow. I was a stomach sleeper now that I'm pregnant I can't do that. This seriously helped me make the switch.
I love this pillow.  I'm 28 weeks pregnant and have been using it since I was 15  weeks.  I don't think I'd be able to sleep without it.
I have horrible back pain even when I'm not pregnant. The chiropracter recommeded sleeping with a pillow between my legs, but it always felt awkward. When I was pregnant the first time my back pain was 10x's worse. I didn't really think these maternity pillows would work and I didn't want to spend the money on a bum product.Now that I'm pregnant again I don't want to suffer through the back pain. There were times when it would take me 15 minutes to get out of bed, the first time I was pregnant. I decided to get a maternity pillow this time because the back pain was already starting in the first trimester.After seeing how highly rated this product was I decided that it would be the best one to get. I also got a 20% Amazon Mom coupon that this item qualified for. This really does help align my back so that the pain isn't as bad.It comes with a sheet that shows additional ways to use it during pregnancy and after. I like my head to be propped up and I usually use three pillows to achieve that when I'm sleeping. I don't have to use that anymore. Plus that always gave me a crick in my neck and this way doesn't anymore.It's not that bukly in bed. What I do is I put it on the outside so that I can either face it or have my back to it. It doesn't push my husband out of the bed so that works out for him. He never has to deal with it.The bonus of this pillow is that my 2 1/2 year old son loves it. You can do a swirl position with it (the card you get with it shows you) and I put my son in the middle. It's like a pillow bean bag chair for him. He likes it so much he falls asleep in it. I wouldn't recommend a smaller child and there is a warning label that says not for younger children.I wish I had this pillow with my first pregnancy, but I'm glad I have it for my 2nd.
I bought this pillow for myself recently. I am currently 27 weeks pregnant with my fourth child. When I read reviews all over the internet, women spouted that *this* is the best pillow on the market. So I excitedly added it to cart and awaited the arrival of my new comfort. I was expecting something more, I suppose because what came out of the package was disappointing.Pros-Folds easily to  position yourself differently. nice to have for propping up in bed.The length is decent. Keep in mind, tall moms like me may find that it's a bit short.Cons -The width of the actual pillow part is very narrow. This makes for not much support area between knees or thighs. The pillow does fold, but it seems awkward to keep it like that.It is very squishy and gives just too much. The stuffing should be firmer and more supportive. This may not be a big deal to some, but it is for me. I was hoping for more support and comfort for my hips during sleep. No dice.The pillow is cumbersome and annoying to turn over during sleep. Let's just go ahead and acknowledge how uncomfortable pregnancy is for many women. Sleeping on one side is just not a reasonable expectation. I think in the future I will go for a pillow that is a full U shape.The covering it comes with is rough and likely needs to be washed and softened a bit. I found it scratchy on my skin. Maybe a pregnancy thing or it really is that scratchy. It's a woven material, feels very cheap to me.
I waited to get this, not having believed that it would be comfortable. Silly me, I love it! I still benefit from an extra pillow under my knee/leg, for extra lift, but this pillow is amazing.
I bought this product when I was 4 months pregnant with twins. I started experiencing back and hip pains and decided it was time to try this pillow. Overall it is a good sleeping companion. It is especially good for naps and when laying down for bedrest. Ultimately my only problem with body pillow is that it is bulky. I had a hard time moving it when I moved positions. At night, it didn't really help with the hip pain as I was still laying with my hips against the matress and no where near the pillow (unless you lay on top the pillow which seems almost impossible when your pregnant). I went to the bathroom A LOT at night and had troubles finding the right position upon returning from the bathroom.In the end it is a great product, but not one you will use on a nightly or even daily basis! My husband loves it though.. he snuggles with it all the time :)
This is so uncomfortable I can't use it. I end up in more pain. I like using my own pillow but I can't seem to with this. It's just awkward. It got such great reviews too but a regular cheap body pillow from target was way better than this.
I bought this pillow a week ago and have noticed a HUGE difference in how much MORE sleep I am getting. I am 5 months pregnant and am not dredding the next 4 months. I wish I had it during my first pregnancy 7 yrs ago and when I was pregnant with twins 5 years ago. It is a back, neck and life saver!
At around the 5 month mark in my pregnancy the aches and sleepless nights hit. That's when I went in search of a good pregnancy pillow and found the embarrassingly named, but effective Snoogle.  It took some getting used to - I'm 6 feet tall and this thing still strikes me as big.  I can't imagine how a petite woman would sleep with it!  And sometimes it felt like the Snoogle was coming after me the way it could curl around and poke me in the back - but once I figured out some new comfortable sleep positions it really became a life saver, and I've continued to use it many months after my baby was born.I've found so many uses for this pillow beyond the traditional side sleeper with a portion tucked between my knees.  It's especially come in handy when using my laptop in bed - with the tightly curved portion as a neck pillow and the long side supporting my arm.  It's also easy to coil up and put under your legs for considerable height and support (I imagine it would be great for back problems or elevating a sprain) - plus the fact that it can twist around so easily makes it easy to fold up and store.The cover has worn well - and it's stayed clean and plush.  I'd definitely recommend it if you're in need of heavy duty support.  Just make sure you have a big enough bed or a partner who's willing to share with your newest sleep buddy.
when you first get this body pillow it will be extra firm. you have to massage it and work the pillow to loose that firmness. i ended up having to take the cover off the pillow to help loosen it up. they have it packed so tight inside. used that case as a template to sew a new one with a little more room. best thing for pregnancy.
My husband and I were worried we wasted fifty bucks on this pillow.  While I tried many-a-time to sleep with the pillow, it didn't make the cut. First of all. I prefer down pillows, I need lots of squish, the snoogle is really for those that prefer a firmer pillow, I share a queen bed, so the snoogle was also somewhat of a hazard.  My poor husband would have to shield himself in case one of the contorted ends came flying as I constantly repositioned myself.  It would be nice, on that note if the pillow was a bit more flexible or if one end was straight.  I fell asleep with it once and felt many awkward pains in my neck, shoulders and back.However, all was not lost, it turns out that it can be a wonderful bumper to put around your baby if she happens to fall asleep on your bed.  My husband and I immediately realized we hadn't bought the Snoogle in vain.
I love this pillow, and my husband tried it and loved it too.  Washing the cover is a little challenging cuz it's hard to put the cover back but overall a great pillow.  I even brought it to the hotel once...but do consider how big your bed is...we have no more room for the puppies since the pillow got here but, i slept so much better.  I got this at month 5 when my belly was just starting to grow.
This pillow is incredible! I ordered it near the beginning of second trimester and use it every single night. It works amazingly in many different positions and it wraps around my body very comfortably. I've been having less back pain since I ordered this. The only downfall to this is the cover. The one that comes with it isn't very soft (it's not terrible but the rest of your bedding will probably be softer) and it is SOOOOOO hard to remove and particularly put back on. I'd recommend upgrading the case even though it's not necessary. I went for the ones that were a little more expensive and had a zipper closure cause it's a pain in the butt when you want to wash your pillow case!
So helpful to get comfortable at night! Must get for pregnant women! I hesitated to get one but not regretting the decision.
I used this SO well while I was pregnant!  It definitely relieved a lot of the pressure and stress on my body, and it definitely helped make my sleeping time much  more comfortable.
I did a lot of research before buying this pillow and I chose it because it was priced right and had high reviews. When I got it, I'm not going to lie, I was disappointed. It is big and bulky and I had no idea how to use it. The suggested uses didn't work for me. However, after working with it I have found a way that I can sleep with it and it is comfortable and now I'm to the point where I NEED it to sleep. Also, I have a couple small male dogs, they like to sometimes mark new items and to my horror they marked my pillow. I washed it and dried it in my washer and dryer and it came out perfect! I love this pillow and highly recommend it.
I was pretty excited to buy and use snoogle during my pregnancy but when I got it it didn't really fulfill my expectations. First, I can't get comfortable with it because it forces you to assume a certain position (either with the pillow behind your back or front). If you belong to the group of people who wake up in exactly the same position as they fell asleep - great, maybe it'll work for you. If, however, you move at night, you will wake up every time you turn. EVERY TIME. I tried sleeping with it a couple times and ended up throwing it on the floor since I don't like it to wake me up all the time - that kind of defeats the purpose. It's also way too big (the size of a human), too heavy and too firm. You won't be able to support your belly on it, only sort of lean on it. At first I thought I would give it a chance and try it when my belly gets bigger but now that I'm 8 months pregnant, I prefer a Walmart $5 body pillow way better. At least you can control and adjust the pillow to YOU, and not the opposite. The other bad thing is that the covers for this thing are more than half of the price of the pillow. I bought my Snoogle at Babies R Us and it did not come with a cover so that's kind of a pain, too. My advice - not worth the money if you are a tosser and turner.
Loved this pillow w my 2nd pregnancy (wore it out and didn't like it w my 3rd). Price is great. Highly recommend buying a cover for it. The one it comes w is fine but like cheap fabric balls up after just a couple weeks.  And like I mentioned I wore it out so to use it for another pregnancy it just wasn't to par anymore. Probably could have put more stuffing in it but I didn't.
If there was a way to give this 6 stars, I would. I can't say enough how much I love the Snoogle. I tried using a pillow btw my knees, then a body pillow, and both would go flat. The Snoogle stays the same shape and makes my back and hips soooooo happy! I slept so good once I got this! I HIGHLY recommend!
I just didn't care for this at all.  The head part was not high enough for me - I am a two pillow sleeper.  The curve drove me batty because this pillow did not eliminate the need to toss and turn, just made it harder.  Couldn't figure out the belly support feature - just didn't help me.  Doesn't come with a case which is $20 and all in all I think just knowing I am sleeping on a $40 pillow makes me uncomfortable!  I returned it the next day - just not worth it.  I'll stick with my pillow arsenal - it's not ideal but it's free and works just as well as this.
This pillow was the BEST investment I have made so far in handling the discomforts of pregnancy. The quality of my sleep has improved and I have fewer aches and pains when I get out of bed. It sounds crazy but this pillow seriously changed my life.
I bought a Snoogle at about 5 months pregnant because I could no longer stand the terrible lower back pain I was waking up with night after night. After using it for a couple of weeks, these are the big issues I've had:1) The material and filling feel cheaper than you'd expect for the price. It's not nearly as nice to put my head on as my regular pillow.2) It gets quite hot. If I try to sleep with this plus a sheet and blanket I wake up covered in sweat, even though it's the middle of winter. I'd have to imagine it's even more uncomfortable during the summer.3) It's very bulky and awkward, especially when you have to get up to pee 3+ times a night. And you can forget about going to sleep snuggled with your partner!4) The straight back portion doesn't do a great job of conforming to my body, so it doesn't always give support where I need it. Pulling it tight under my head and between my legs helps, but I find myself having to readjust frequently.With all of that aside, I'm still glad I bought it - my back pain isn't totally gone but it's nowhere near as bad as it used to be, and that alone makes it worth it to me.
I have had this pillow for about 3 months now. I definitely like sleeping with this better than just a normal pillow under my head and between my legs. I went on vacation recently and was debating whether to lug it along, so I tried sleeping with normal pillows for a couple nights. It made me realize how much more comfortable I can get with the support from this pillow.I followed another reviewer's suggestion to cover the top of the pillow with a pillow case- great idea. That's the main area that I like to change often, anyways, and covers what other reviewers said was scratchy. The rest of the pillow seems fine with the cover it comes with, not too scratchy for my body at all.When you first get the pillow, the head part does seem a little fluffy, but after using it a week or so, it flattens out a bit and has pretty much stayed the same from that point.I like the different positions that you can get from this pillow, and I switch sides throughout the night to take advantage of them both. This is a bit annoying because of how the bottom curves so much, but the curve does help support your back when using it that way, which really is nice, so I guess I'm glad for it.Here is an overview of the two ways I use this pillow:Belly toward pillow: you can prop up one arm, have legs either bent and totally supported or out with knees supported, and tuck the back support under your rear which keeps your back supported.Belly away from pillow: allows you to lay your whole back on the pillow, relieving pressure from your side, and lets you stretch your legs out (or bent). This is nice because once you get to the point in your pregnancy when you aren't allowed to lay on your back, you feel as if you never get the chance to really stretch your body (and belly) out.All in all, I am glad that I bought this. A little pricy, but I have definitely appreciated it (especially because I am expecting twins, so my belly was larger earlier and will be for longer!)
I purchased this pillow when I was pregnant in 2010/2011 and I loved it. I was very comfortable using it and I felt like the footprint of the pillow was not much bigger then the space I normally use on my side of the bed. I didn't feel like it was so big that my husband was being pushed off the bed, which was good!I love this pillow! I didn't want to give it up even after I had my son. It made sleeping a dream (pun intended). I didn't have any sleeping issues with my pregnancy and it kept me very comfortable. It hugs my body and supports my hips, back, and stomach.I always recommend this pillow to my pregnant friends!
Does it work?I received this as a very thoughtul gift at around 4 months in my pregnancy (I do have to admit that probably would not spend this much on myself);  at 4 months i didn't really need it;  at 5 months (or around there), once you are told that you should not be sleeping on your back, I tried it out.  I didn't like it at first, but as your tummy grows and you get increasingly more uncomfortable, this pillow helped with lower back discomort and to support a growing belly.  I'm about 5'1 there was more then enough 'real estate' to give me support where needed.  it bends easily, which is a big plus.  It also didn't take most of our bed, as I thought it would. Overall - once you get used to it - yes, it will help you sleep betterIs it worth the price?that's up to you to decide.  All I can say is that with the 2nd baby (and as I got older), comfort was very important, but that's a personal take..What about quality?As other reviewers mentioned, the cover is made out of a VERY cheap cotton-like fabric, it is scratchy and not soft at all.  My work-around, instead of buying a more expensive 2nd cover (which is really what they want you to do), I put my own pillow case over the top (head) part of the pillow and wrapped it the best i could.. it's not ideal - but it's free and i get to sleep on a nicer fabric (it really doesn't matter for the bottom as much..your legs won't know the differenceOverall?  I would recommend it for comfort; if you can't afford the price-tag, start with a wedge and something for between your legs, should be sufficient if you don't have lower back problems.
I bought this pillow on recommendation from ladies on my birth board to alleviate hip and back pain, but that's not the use to which I've put it mostly.Don't get me wrong - it's awesome for those conditions, and when I nap, I tend to use it as a long body pillow which has just the right amount of support and width for my stomach and to go between my legs.  I love that it's not as wide as a standard pillow or as full as my Boppy, because it is so much more comfortable than any pillow I've used for that purpose.  I'm 5'8" and not a small framed woman, so that might make a difference, but I do know a few petite women who really enjoy it as well.  When I first received it, I looked on the back of the cover and it showed 10 or so different ways you can arrange the Snoogle - for lower body, upper body, as a wedge, etc.  And I have ended up using several of them.In my case, I've been experiencing awful sinus congestion and acid reflux from a relaxed esophageal sphincter.  The only way I can get any sleep is propped up on pillows, which has really been awful for my back.  Enter the Snoogle.  I curl the Snoogle like a donut so my head is supported by the top, my arm is in the hole so that it doesn't fall asleep, and my upper back is supported by the bottom of the donut.Ankles swollen?  Curl the Snoogle up under my legs.  Needing extra back and stomach support while lounging on the couch?  Wrap one end of the Snoogle around my stomach and curl up the other end behind my back like an upside down U.  It is so versatile and so comfortable that I have yet to find a bad way to prop/curl/fold it.It's been such a great investment and I have a feeling I'll find even more uses for it after this baby is born.
I just deleted my first review, which I made after owning this pillow for a month.  I originally gave it 4 stars, taking one off because it's bulky and makes it difficult to roll over.However, after owning it for 3 months, the top (where my head rests) was completely flat and I had to use a second pillow under my head.  It also ripped right on the inside of the curve where my shoulder hit it.  On top of all of that, you can't purchase covers for it, so I was stuck trying to deal with a standard pillow case cover over the top which just got tangled and fell off every night.I wish I would have just bought a new body pillow, it would have saved me a lot of money and headache dealing with this huge thing.
My husband purchased it for me when I was in the first trimester. I did not use this pillow much especially when I was nauseous and was having a heartburn. The material is quite soft and very comfortable to hug and sleep, and I started using it every night in the second semester when my belly got bigger. I put my another normal pillow on the head part so that I can sleep better even I suffer from a heartburn. This is a highly recommend item!
I'm 25 wks pg with my 3rd. I finally got a "pregnancy pillow" and I have to say I love it. It helps keep my hip from hurting so badly. The first night I never even woke up! That's really saying something. I usually have to wake up to roll over once one hip goes to sleep. It's huge and takes up a ton of room but I am really enjoying it. I co-sleep a small amount of the time with my older too and they both love it too, they like snuggling up to the other side.
i cannot sleep with out this pillow!so comfortable!!!one &#34;eh&#34; quality is i was mine a lot and ita a pain in the neck to take the pillow case on and off.
I imagine this will make life way more comfortable when I am pregnant. For right now, its a great way to prop myself in bed while watching tv and working on my laptop, all the different curves make great makeshift shelves for my devices
I can see how this pillow would be helpful for some women, but it didnt work for me. My biggest problem was that I couldn't use my own pillow, your head will naturally rest on the top part of this pillow. Also, I tend to flip sides a lot throughout the night especially when wakeful. The uncomfortableness of pregnancy meant that I would want to change positions frequently during the night. You pretty much need to get out of bed, flip the pillow over, then crawl back in and adjust if you want to change sides. Not cool for me. Once arranged, I did enjoy the back and hip support. This pillow just didnt match up with my sleep style. For me, putting a smaller pillow between my legs worked best. If you tend to like to switch sides during the night or you are attached to your head pillow, I would pass on this.
I am so happy I ordered this product. I am not necessarily sleeping better, because I still have to get up and pee every two hours and am constantly getting beaten up from the inside by this little boy. But when I am in bed and do manage to catch some Zzzz's, I am so much more comfortable.I have two complaints, which aren't even really complaints because I know they can't be remedied:1) Because of the shape of the pillow, the cover is very difficult to get on and off for washing.2) It is hard to turn over from side to side because the pillow is so big and oddly shaped.Again, those are both pretty much unavoidable grievances, because what makes the pillow so great is the odd shape and size. So there you have it! Great for those who can't get comfortable in bed! I am SO happy I have mine--I don't know if I will go back to my regular pillow after this pregnancy is over!
This pillow really didn't work for me. I'm 5'4&#34; and started pregnancy at 106lbs then gained 25lbs. The material feels very cheep to me and the cover is not soft at all. The part that goes under your head is not soft and an odd shape. The part that should support your back is too rounded so it doesn't even touch my back. The part for between your knees is tube like in the wrong direction so it cuts off circulation. The part under your belly doesn't line up right and is too firm for comfort. I bought a $10 body pillow from a local store and love it. I suggest sticking with this better solution and am sorry I waisted my money. Frankly the $10 body pillow appears to be much better materials inside and out.
I LOVED THIS PILLOW!  So much my husband got jealous of it :o)  By second trimester I needed something to help me sleep comfortably and this did the trick.  I since passed it down to my sister while she was pregnant and she too agrees it is a must have.
I had the misfortune of breaking my sternum at ~ 7 months pregnancy.  After the break I found that moving the one pillow I was using to support my leg when I layed on my side was too hard for me so I tried sleeping with 3 pillows but that too was too hard since the pillows moved and yanking them into place was hard.  So I bought this pillow and found how miraculous it is to have a pillow that is in place and only *I* have to move in its center.  I find it comfortable for supporting my legs and my top arm (that top arm being supported is critical for comfort with a broken sternum) when sleeping on my sides.  I also sometimes use it for modified back sleeping with the bottom loop under my knees and one side propped under one side of my back.  The one draw-back is that the head rest part is not always the right height but I don't know how they would/could fix that.  I think this pillow could be useful for non-pregnant patients with broken sternums as it helps make the 3 available sleeping positions (back and two sides) more comfortable.  Also note that this pillow comes with a white pillow case so you don't necessarily need another one.  I put a king-size cotton pillow case on it where my head rests and wash that part more frequently than the regular one.  (Plus the regular one seems to be polyster so it doesn't breathe as well as my cotton one.)
I had a really difficult pregnancy with a lot of pelvic and back pain. The ONLY way I could sleep was with this pillow. It was expensive, but worth every penny. I didn't bother with the additional cover. Honestly, the plain one was a hassle to put on, but it wasn't something I had to do every day and it only took 5 minutes when I did.
I tried this a few nights before it got ole' heave-ho! It did not help me at all. I was better off with the regular pillow between my legs. I don't know why it didn't work for me, but it didn't. It was uncomfortable and hard to roll from side-to-side with. And it takes up so much space.... Don't recommend this at all... especially for the price.
I got this for my first pregnancy and now I'm using it for round 2.  There are both pros and cons to this product.ProsProvides support between knees and under belly.Easy to figure out how to use.Full length back support.ConsPriceyBulky and cumbersome-we have a Queen sized bed and this thing takes up the space of an average(130-160lbs)person.The fabric feels a bit itchy-especially the portion of the pillow that wraps under the head and touches a persons face.Overall, I use a combination of this pillow and 2 regular bed pillows every night.  I'm currently 31wks along and have suffered from pinched/herniated discs in my spine prior to pregnancy, so I deal with pain daily & nightly-just the pain level varies.  Some nights this pillow is the only way I can get any rest-other nights this pillow is too awkward to manipulate and use so I rely on my regular pillows.  If you're not getting sleep, it's worth a try but if you are sleeping ok save your money-this product had little use for me after I delivered my first child and I'm assuming it will return to the back of the closet after this pregnancy too.
I don't know how I slept during my other pregnancies. Bought this pillow with my last baby and slept like a queen! This pillow is so soft and supportive all at the same time. Every pregnant woman should have one.
I used this for most of my pregnancy and I love it.  I will keep it to use next time too.  It is difficult to get out of bed if the pillow is next to the edge of the bed (because you have to get over the pillow), but it is still very helpful and comfy.  The cover is a little bit of a pain to get back on after washing, but not too terrible.  It really helped to keep me comfortably on my side throughout the majority of my pregnancy.  I was a back sleeper prior to pregnancy.
I used my Snoogle for my last 2 pregnancies and it was such a relief on my back and hips once I started having to sleep on my side. Now with my third pregnancy I have purchased another Snoogle. I had given my original one away after my second child was born and when I found out I was having a third this was one of my first purchases. I can actually sleep at night now and it helps me to stay on my side. I love sleeping on my back and the Snoogle helps me stay on either side instead.
I've had this pillow for 3 weeks and I am still not convinced.it does kind of help but I still find myself laying on the other side.Not as comfortable as I thought it would be.
I do agree with other reviews that you can't take the pillow cover off....you'll never get it back on.  It's a bit scratchy so I'm making another pillow case to go over the current one.  I don't know how durable it will be as under the pillow case, it looks like the same material as airline pillows.  For now, it is wonderful!
Got this pillow for my pregnant wife. She was starting to get really uncomfortable around 4 months. This pillow helped her sleep at night and alleviated pains she was having. This is a much better option then using separate pillows. The Snoogle pillow fits between your legs and underneath your head. Yes this pillow will take up extra space in your bed but it's definitely worth it to have a happy wife.
So I just noticed this pillow looks like a piece of poo.  However, it is very comfortable and perfect for pregnancy.  I have the worst hip pain and this pillow helps alleviate that pain.
These pads don't stay put--I'm constantly having to re-position them throughout the day. They also are very flat and too stiff, so they're uncomfortable and show through a shirt. If they were softer and more flexible I think they'd work fine because they seem pretty absorbent, but they still slide around in a nursing bra too much. I guess it's back to the disposable nursing pads for me!
LOVe that these have the one side that doesn't leak through. I produce a LOT of milk and during the day these are perfect! At night I have to change them once or else I would be soaked but if I do that it never gets all over my clothes and leaks straight out front. My mom have ones almost exactly like this and she loved them, then we found these and I love them and my sister loves them.
saving assistance, as they should not buy these again, I never noticed anything in the bra, or in the clothes
These are excellent. I bought some cheap ones and they are no where near as nice as these, I love mine
Could be reused and easy to wash. Pure cotton touchs comfortable for my wife. The only pity is just 6 pieces.
they are very soft. but they don't stay in place like said. they fall out. I had several experiences where they have moved and fallen on floor. embarrassing. very soft cotton but don't stay in place. I like my medea brand better
At first I wasn't crazy about these. They leaked overnight in the early nursing days when I had a crazy over supply and if they dried before I removed them fuzz would stick to my nipples.After several washes this problem was solved, they don't stick anymore and they are so incredibly soft and such a great value for your money.I still have a really strong milk supply and a lot of milk leakage, but these pads have contained everything since the first 4 weeks.
I hate to throw lots of disposable stuff out so I wanted reusable pads. These work just fine and love that they come with a bag to wash them in so they don't get lost.
i am always looking for a good alternative to disposable products! these where a great find. soft, comfortable, absorbent, discreet, and the wash bag actually holds up and was a lifesaver. cant beat the price or the value. i bought three sets for myself and three for a friend, so i could throw them in with my whites once a week. I have a really large bust, so i normally have trouble finding things that work, but i gave these to my friend that boasts about her &#34;micro boobs&#34; and she loved them too.
Disposable pads seem like such a waste to me!  These pads work well, wash well and are comfortable for someone who doesn't leak a lot (there is no waterproof lining in these).  You want a thicker bra though to hide the shape of the pad, as it isn't as thin as the disposable pads.
These pads would be great is they weren't so thick and if they were larger. They're so bulky that you can see them through clothing very easily. Because they are so small and don't stay in place well, they always seem to be just off to the side of the nipple whenever my milk lets down, so I end up leaking. I have a few pairs of nursing pads that seem to be just a couple layers of flannel and they work great. They're thinner and cover more area. I would try to find flannel ones instead of these.
These are very absorbent and are soft against your skin.  I love that they came with their own washing bag so I can keep track of them in the laundry.
They do not absorb milk as good as the disposable once, and I do not even have a lot of milk. They made of cotton, so they get wet very fast and so your short. I use the disposable one by Lansinoh and I love them.
I bought these hoping to be environmentally friendly. I tried wearing these once and had a huge wet spot after just one feeding. They absorbed nothing and had a spot bigger than if I did not use anything.
From the wife/mom: Disposable is always best, but to save money, the washable pads are always a good option. The Philips washable is definitely better than my Medela washable. It keeps its shape a lot better, and you don't see it through your clothes as much. I also like that there are 3 pairs (the Medela only had 2 pairs), so you don't feel super rushed to wash. Finally, the Philips feels a lot better on your skin as well.
It's absorbant, cute, and I've had no leaks!  They are a little thicker/bulkier than other brands I've used, but I don't mind.
I leaked through these immediately, they barely absorbed anything. I ended up going back to Evenflo disposables. They aren't as environmentally conscious, but they work SO MUCH BETTER.
I ended up getting a good deal on these as an add-on to an order, and luckily for me, it turned out to be a pretty nice product. They are comfortable to wear, and more importantly, they are discrete under clothing!  They are backed with lace, but I don't think it's a waterproof barrier.  The nicest part about this product was receiving the mesh bag to wash them in!  Then I can keep track of all of my pads after washing and drying.
Initially I thought they were comfortable, moderately thick, and the padding doesn't bunch up over multiple washings. I like not having to use disposables which seems wasteful since I'd have to go though a lot of them over all the months that I'm nursing.These nursing pads do have quite a bit to be desired. They leak frequently to the point where I'd wake up in the middle of the night with milk soaked both through these nursing pads and my clothing. I'm taking the time to update my review after having a different experience using this brand of nursing pads with my second child...I don't have trouble with my milk supply when nursing my second child. Unfortunately, I can't use these nursing pads anymore since they leak constantly even during the day. They are especially bad when I let down while nursing my child on the other side and I never wear these overnight.It worked ok most of the time for my first child when I wasn't nursing often and had limited milk supply when he was an older baby. However, if you are nursing a newborn or needing reliable protection steer clear of these nursing pads unless you're trying to win a wet t-shirt contest!
I love the look and feel of these.  Very soft against the skin.  They have great absorbency.  (Note, I've not worn them overnight)  I do have a hard time getting them to stay put in my sports bra.  They would probably be ok in a regular bra though.
So i was skeptical thinking that these things wouldn't work!! was i wrong! I put these in the washer ( and it comes with its own washing bag too) and they come out looking perfect!! I do not dry them however( so i can not vouche for this part of the cleansing process) i leave them in the bag and let them air dry which takes a hour at the most!! I am a size 38B with full milk in breast so fairly small boob size and these do not show up under my clothing. A great price for awesome quality!!
I'm using these pads all the time. They seem a little on the big side, I have to make sure they stay tucked in. Otherwise the quality seems great and they absorb what I need them to absorb. I bought 2 sets, but really need a 3rd to make it through a week.
The bamboobies pads I tried were always soaked but did not breathe so I developed thrush while using them. These Avent pads provided just enough material to contain leaks and are cute too. Similar to medela pads but these have a really pretty lace outer layer.
These were highly recommended to me from a friend so I decided to try them out and love them also.  They are cheaper than disposables and more environmentally friendly.  Yes they will show through a thin bra, but so will disposables.  If you have slight padding on your bra they will not show through.  I've noticed other reviews say they do not absorb well, move a lot, and stick to your nipples, but I did not experience any of that. I wash them in the bag they came in and dry them on the delicate cycle and they come out as good as new after every wash.
this is a nice option to the disposable ones.... easy to wash and comes with its own bag for washing.
These are not very absorbent even after multiple washings.  They get hard if I don't change them quickly enough after a leak, and they also make me fuzzy if I am not completely dry when I put them on...  Small things, but not things I really want to worry about all the time.  I would also prefer a slightly larger size.
I tried to like disposable pads and they just didn't work for me. These are awesome! The brushed cotton that touches your nipp is soooo soft and wicks away moisture so your not sitting against wet. I swear It actually helped heal my cracked nipp. They come with a little baggy which is great for laundry time. The lace is actually pretty and you can tell the right side even in the dark!
I thought that these would be great, to be able to just wash them and reuse them. Don't have to worry about running out, etc. etc. No first of all, they stick to your nipples which is THE LAST thing you want when you have sore nipples. It was similar to pulling a bandaid off of my sore nipples. OUCH. Plus, I used lanolin, etc to help soothe my nipples and the pad just wicked it away and looked gross, so I had to change them more often than I would have liked. All in all, a waste of money for me.
these are perfect when your milk supply is not as great. very economical and they come in a mesh bag so they don't get lost in the washer.
These pads are terrible. I used the Avent disposables which are the absolute best,  so I thought their washables would be good as well. Well that was a big mistake. They curve outward instead of following the natural curve of the breast, making them visible under any type of shirt or sweater. I figured I could use them when I was home. Then I got tired of changing clothes from all the leaks I experienced. These pads don't absorb much at all. What I was saving on disposables, I was wasting on detergent and time.
I love these!  They're very comfortable and soft, and they work great!  I haven't had one embarrassing leaking accident!  LOVE them!
I bought these after 6 months of using disposable nursing pads. I just hated wasting the money every 2 months for pads, and wanted to explore the washable options available.This was my first try, and I LOVE them! I just bought a second set, so I have 6 pairs, and will almost always have one set clean.I've washed them in the laundry bag they came in and they came out great. Super comfy and absorbant. My daughter is 6 months old and we have started weaning her night feedings, and extending the time between regular daytime feedings as well due to the introductions of solids, so I find I am leaking more than I was. I also have a pretty heavy letdown, and while they don't shift too much, they will shift some - but so do the disposables.Overall, they are great, and I have already suggested them to several of my friends who are nursing moms!
If you leak a lot or have oversupply (before solids, especially if you're pumping also), these pads aren't good enough. I leaked right through them several times before I just decided to purchase some disposables with plastic backing. When my milk leaking slows down a little, I will start using them again.
Its washable and help to save money on those disposable types. Its durable and very nice lacy design. Would buy more.
These pads work great..  I am nursing my child so I wear these in my bras through out the day and while I sleep.  They absorb really well without you feeling the wetness.  You also can't even tell you have them on.
I use these regularly and find them to do a good job.  But, you need to pay attention as they do not have #1 super absorbing gels or #2 a waterproof backing once they are full they will leak through.  I mostly use them at home and as a second layer when needed inside of a disposable.
The Philips avent washable nursing pads is a big help when I'm at work doesn't get wet easily and worth the price.
I started trying different brands/types of breast pads and out of the four I have tried so far these are my favorite. I hated the disposables  and several of the washables that I tried stated they were waterproof but have leaked through onto my clothes. These are rather thick but very absorbent and are so soft when they come out of the wash. I stopped buying other brands and now own 18 (3 sets) of them and they are holding up nicely with the frequent washing.
Loved these. they stood up to numerous washings (free in a regular wash cycle) and stayed put during wear better than any other brands. And they look almost brand new and ready for next time
This organizing station works great with the wipe warmer. Worked out great. Can't beat the price. A must if you have the warmer.
I bought this to try to get some organization for my diapers as I have two babies in them. But it doesnt hold a bag of diapers so Im constantly filling this up. Itd be so much easier if it held a bag. I would understand if it didnt hold the box of diapers but newborn size 1 diapers? really? It barely even holds one row! waste of money for me....
The dresser top Diaper Depot is a great thing to have in the nursery. The Prince Lionheart wipe warmer sits perfectly on top of it. I did not need the space to store diapers, but use that area for Q-tips, lotion, thermometer, etc. It has really organized the changing area for us. I highly recommend it!
This thing was awesome to keep diapers, wipes, and creams organized all with in arm's reach of the changing pad.  Holds a good amount of diapers, even when they're the bigger sizes.  Keeps your changing table looking neat.
I have a munchkin diaper organizer that I love.  However, it comes in blue and green only.  I was looking for something a bit more feminine or neutral for my daughters room.  The price is comparable to the munchkin version, so I went with this on looks alone.  I regret that, but the box is long gone so I can't return.  The side bins on the PLH depot are too narrow from side to side and from front to back.  My powder nor my lotion bottles will fit into the side compartments.  Also, they sit forward of the back of this depot and stop short of the front.  A decent amount of wasted storage space, given that you can't really fit anything of size into the compartments.  The munchkin version has larger side compartments and more side storage space.  Though the munchkin compartments are divided, I can still get my larger bottles, etc into them.  That said, the plastic of the PLH depot is sturdy and the pieces fit together well.  It's ok for what it is.  If you don't want blue or green, go with this one.  If you don't mind blue or green, go with munchkin's version.
We LOVE this diaper depot! We have one in the nursery and one downstairs. We've had them both since our little one was born so 15 months now. They get daily use. The one downstairs is on a bit of an unsturdy table that's about 4 feet from the ground. It has fallen at least 20 times and has yet to break. I'm amazed each & every time I pick it up to find no broken pieces. The top will snap off but hasn't broken at all. It's really taken a beating & still looks great! It holds between 20-25 diapers, depending on size, and the 2 side bins hold a decent bit. In just one side we have the diaper cream, another tube for eczema, saline drops, nose aspirator, nail clippers, & a pair of socks. It keeps everything close at hand & organized. We use wipes warmers and they're just a little bit bigger so they don't fit perfectly but they do sit on the top just fine. We are completely satisfied with this product and are buying a 3rd one for the nursery for our next baby we're having. I'd highly recommend and have found it to make diaper changes so much easier!
We've used this since my son was born and I love it!  Everything is nice and neat, and I don't have to go searching for anything (diaper cream, lotion, brush).
I really needed a diaper caddy for my newborn and this works perfectly. I have a prince lionheart wipes warmer that fits perfectly on top, and the side containers hold all the lotions and creams I need for her. Very pleased with this purchase.
I love this diaper organizer. I have the munchkin wipes warmer and it sits on top just fine. I don't have any problems with it sliding around or lifting up when I remove a wipe. I love that I can remove the side containers, I have both of mine sitting on one side because of the size of my changing table and it works great. Between the two side containers I have a large JJ lotion, a tube of aquafor, butt paste, thermometer, bulb syringe, nail clippers and a tiny container of Vaseline. The bulb syringe is kind of hanging out the top but other than that everything fits just fine.
It looks exactly as shown on the picture and its good size, fits enough items and looks pretty on my dresser. A great organizer!
This item works great it doesn't move, and holds a good amount of diapers so it only has to be refilled every few days. The wipes go on top and the wipe bin doesn't move at all. Simple and easy.
I was expecting to live with flimsy plastic when I purchased this due to the price point, but ended up being very impressed with the sturdy nature of this organizer.  It's really easy to use and holds up great!  We even mounted it to our wall with 3M stickies and it serves as an easy access diaper depot.  Worth the money!
We keep this downstairs at the pack and play and our mid level diaper changing station which is adjacent to the living room.  We had been using the pockets on the pack and play to store diapers, powder etc and that was OK but this is WAY better.Solidly made, very sturdy and holds about 2 days worth of diapers (for our 6 week old). Allows us to keep the area pulled together and tidy while keeping everything at hand for a quick diaper change.We ordered two and love them!
I've used this since my son was born 16 months ago.  Its so handy and holds diapers from newborn to size 6! The wipe tub fits great on top too.  Its with stood pounding from my son before too (though not too much).  I'd definitely recommend this for any diaper station.
In theory, this looks like it might be useful. However, the side compartments are really small. Not even an average size bottle of cornstarch can fit in it. When I try go to remove something from there, like a tube of cream, the plastic side piece detaches and I have to click it back into place (all of these pieces can disconnect, which could be nice, but I found that they would disconnect when I did not want them to). The diaper areas in the front do not hold many diapers at all. The top doesn't have a non slip grip, so the box of wipes just slides all over. PAIN IN THE REAR. I returned this and bought a large basket that I keep on the changing table edge and just put all my supplies into.
It came cracked but it's not that serious. I do like it though because it saves space on my daughter's dresser with changing pad.
We wanted something to keep everything for diaper changes organized. The Diaper Depot does just that, but ours arrived a little cracked. I think it cracked due to poor packaging by Prince Lionheart. I give it 4 stars because of the packaging and crack...
We have the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer, and in hoping to keep the dresser dry and &#34;spill free&#34; we opted to purchase this.  I store baby wash clothes on the side compartments and cloth diaper shells in the front.  (The only real reason I use the &#34;storage&#34; is to prevent dust from being accumulated into those compartments.)  It is perfect for the wipes warmer, but you could just as easily use it as a handy diaper depot if you're using regular diapers and a regular wipes box.  Good quality and perfect for my needs!
I got this as a baby shower gift.  I thought it would be a great and useful item, but it ended up taking up a lot of room on the shelves of the changing table and doesn't really hold a lot of diapers.Also, I use a wipe warmer, so this is too tall to fit the warmer on top of it under the shelf of the changing table.I found that the diaper stacking bag that matched my crib set held a lot more diapers, and also took up less room because it can hang off the side of the table.
Wonderful invention. Holds quite a few diapers and our wipes warmer along with diaper cream, hair brush, nail clippers and various other odds and ends that fit in the side containers. Great product
my girlfriend had one for her son & I knew when I found out I was pregnant that I needed one. keeps everything all in once place and organized! Still using it with my 2nd child. Love that the side compartments are removable so you can customize it to the space that you have.
This helped turn the top of our bureau into a changing table. It holds the wipes, diapers, diaper cream, etc. and keeps everything organized and easy to access!
It does a great job organizing all your diaper needs into a smaller compact station.  It comes with four attachable little rubber feet so that it stays put.  It will fit approximately a dozen diapers depending on size.  It's really useful to organize and it will go to good use over the years.
This keeps all the items I need for a diaper change in one place. I love how organized this makes me feel
Great item. Fits diaper warmer, diapers, rash cream, lotions or toothpaste. Perfect amount of space for all that you need. I haven't needed more space that this offers at our current changing table. Great buy
I absolutely hate this pump!  I went through 3 of these because I wasn't able to get my money back and could only exchange.  The motor broke twice and one time it suctioned in and never released.  Instead of exchanging it for a fourth time, I just threw the whole thing out.  The part that attaches to the motor/handle and the piece that allows milk through are impossible to clean.  Eventually, on all 3 that I went through, the milk builds up in the piece that attaches to the bottle (only takes a few pumps to fill this up) and you have to break suction for it to filter through.  It continues to do this for as long as you're pumping.  If you don't realize that the milk hasn't gone through, the built up milk gets into the motor/handle and leaks out through the suction power control.  The massage bubbles on the cup are uncomfortable and only irritate your breasts.  The suction dies down almost immediately making pumping take so much longer.  This pump is such a waste of money.  Buyer beware!
I used this pump after my husband went out and bought it for me.  When I found out how much he spent on it, I thought to myself "this pump is gonna stink...you get what you pay for"  Boy, was I WRONG.  This pump was great.  It provided varying amounts of suction to provide just the right amount that you required.  It was quick, simple and VERY easy to use...included a AC adapter which I found provided more power than the battiers did.  I only wish that it came with more bottles.
This monitor did not work for us.  It let out a loud click about every 20 seconds or so and then about once an hour it would start giving out static for about a minute for no reason.  This monitor kept us from sleeping and we had to go exchange it.  NO GOOD!
I had read reviews of this monitor and was very skeptical.  I had a monitor by Fisher Price and it hummed constantly, not allowing us to hear our son when he cried. My husband and I decided to purchase this monitor, not having remembered the reviews it received.  I must say, we are pleased with the monitor.  It does make some static now and again, but this is normal for any type of radio transmitted device.  I simply turn the monitor off, then back on again and it resolves the problem.  What I have noticed is that when I have it on channel B in the babies room and on channel A in the bedroom or living room (easy to do accidentally), there is a lot of static but you can still hear the baby.  I would like to believe the previous poor reviews have been due to &quot;operator error&quot; but there are so many, it's hard to say.  The only downside I find with this monitor is that even when the volume is on the lowest setting, it is still quite sensitive to baby noises - but better to be safe than sorry!
I live in a condo and have cordless phones and wireless internet. I found this product had terrible static and made cracking/popping sounds.In comparison, the Fisher Price 900mhz Long Range Monitor sounded excellent.
Had this product for a while and were very dissatisfied. The only thing you can hear is static. We got now Greco and very happy.
I dont have a center head rest, so I had to attach it to a side headrest and then angle it towards the middle. It moves now and then, and I have to adjust it, but other than that it works great!
This mirror is great! It gives you a big field of view so it is easy to see the baby in your rear view mirror, the baby can see him self in the mirror (which is nice amusement if they wake up on a long ride), and its so easy to take off and switch between cars if need be.My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner. This will always be on my list of baby presents to get new parents.
We had some problems with the mirrors designed to see our daughter when she was rear facing so I was kind of leery in buying this one for her when she became a forward facer but she loves it!The mirror itself doesn't seem to scratch like the others ones did and it secured with ease to the front headrest.  She has always loved mirrors and this has been a very inexpensive way to entertain her in the car.
I received hand-me-down mirrors and tested them out.  I found them too small and neither of the two would anchor very well in the car.  I love this mirror.  I put it in and was able to use the tether feature and anchor it properly.  I had my car seat inspected by the Highway Patrol and the officer said she usually recommends that parents not use mirrors because of safety issues (mirrors falling down on babies during traffic accidents, etc.) but she loved the mirror I had purchased because of the tether feature.  A must have!
I rec'd these as a shower gift in a 5 pack 6 years ago.I loved them so much, I bought 6 more used ones on Ebay.I now have a new baby.  I tried a couple of other AIOs, like home made patterns, fuzzibunz and dappi, and these are my favorites.You do need a cover, they are a very absorbent puffy comfy cotton.  I recommend Thirsties original (not the duo wrap), because they fit great and don't gap.The diaper itself is very plush and cozy.  I use prefolds during the day, 7th generation for traveling/out and about errands running, and these at night for pee catching.They are fantastic.  They fit a very smallish baby to a medium sized tot, and they are softer with use and washes if that is possible.  I love the insert flat for doubling, but so far I haven't even needed a doubler with them (kid is just short of 3 months old.)I like how they wash open, just attach the velcro tabbies so they don't catch on delicate clothes.  I hang them dry most of the time, but sometimes I will tumble and then hang dry if I need theme faster.I think 12 is a good number of these to have for solely night use especially if you use different diapers during the day, they will take you through several months and 12 is good for getting you to your next wash.I also like the cute prints.Highly recommend.
I own quite a few reusable diapers but these were by far the worst ones I've ever purchased. They are bulky and stiff. I returned them immediately after opening the package. I understand the quality is there in terms of being 100% cotton but they could be redesigned so that they can actually fit under a piece of clothing.
Before my baby was born I thought I'd love these, but it turns out that I really, really don't. First of all they are extremely bulky which isn't very conducive to a baby learning to crawl and develop their muscles well because it forces their legs so far apart.My baby pees a lot and I just don't see it worth putting these great big things into the wash after she just peed. I go through 17 diapers a day (because I change her immediately). At this price this is WAY too expensive. I've found using liners and just five covers works great for me. And seventeen of these wouldn't even fit in my washer every day.If your baby is a frequent pee-er you might want to consider using something else.
Although you can get them cheaper elsewhere, I highly recommend these flannel, vinyl and velcro diapers to anyone with the time to wash diapers and save room in a landfill. I feel good using these and go through 20 every 2 days with my 2 month old. I also bought the newborn diapers and she's outgrown those. If you're looking for an environmentally-friendly alternative to disposable diapers that are easy to use and clean and dry, try Kushies (I throw mine in the dryer and they hold up great). It will also save you money!
I was so disappointed when these arrived, they were so large and bulky on my toddler and the velcro didn't hold up. They have become my back up diapers for laundry day. Id never order them again.
Pros:Decent priceCute patternsAbsorbentEasy to wash & dryCons:Large and bulky on babyThe pros out-weigh the cons for me.  My baby looks like a little spider but she's so cute it really doesn't bother me.  Great functionality.
This was a great way to see how well you and your baby will do with reusable diapers. 5 isn't enough for one baby to be in them full time. Unless you on doing one to two loads of laundry a day. They are BIG you can't put clothes on your baby unless they are super big, I let my little on wear them with a t-shirt. Only other issue is the staining, nearly impossible to get out but baking soda and peroxide for a whole day of soaking got the stains out. I use these when we are home during the day and when we go out or run errands I put on regular diapers.
They work great! They come very clean, they fit great, and they're cute. They can be a little bit bulky and are NOT good for brand new babies (even if they are 10 pounds). My son was 9 1/2 pounds at birth and 10 1/2 pounds at 2 weeks, but I had to wait until he was about four weeks old (12 lbs) to really use them on him, because they were just entirely too big at first. But, I love them! This is my third child, but my first experience with cloth diapering and I really love them.
ive tried a few different brands, and thought i had found THE one- i needed a few more to add to the stash, so decided to try these out, i cannot believe i thought i didnt need an all in one! they are so much easier, NO leaks, by far the best out of the 5+ types and brands i have already tried!!!
We used these cloth diapers as burp rags, as liners for car seats, as drool catchers when our babies were sleeping... they were wonderful! Soft, cushy, and absorbent, and they became softer with every wash! We use them now to dust with, to soak up spills, and to scrub stains... going on almost 10 years and still going strong.
These pre-folds are thick and absorbent!  They don't feel wet as quickly and hold a lot of liquid.  They wash well and have no rough edges.  A little pricey, but definitely worth the price.
I worked in a hospital and we use to use these as burp rags.  They are absorbant and big enough to use.  Saves babies clothing from stains and wetness.
I got tons of burp clothes for shower gifts, but these are the best ones.  Most obsorbent and practical.  I don't use anything else anymore.  I had a "spitty" baby who was breastfed and it didn't take me long to figure out that these make the best burp clothes.  I recommend giving them as shower gifts.  Very practical.
Well worth the money you pay for these... I had read all these reviews on how soft they are and that sold me.  These are so soft!!!  My little one falls asleep on them they are so soft.  I use them for burp cloths because we prefer really absorbant cloths... these do the trick perfectly and are so easy to wash.Do yourself a favor and buy these... you won't regret it... and will probably end up buying more.  :)
Now that I am a parent I decided to start giving back and writing reviews as so many people helped us new parents out when trying to pick out all the essentials when our twins were born in May of this year.Now to the point... I searched stories like Babies r Us, Target and Amazon of course and these are the thickest, best quality diaper cloth I could find on the market. Not only just to use for normal spit ups and drool but our daughter had pyloric Stenosis which causes a child to vomit just about everything they spit up. Relevance to this review is that it kept us dry at least where the diaper cloth was. After several washes there has been a few strings coming loose on the ends of a few of them but other than that they have worked great!
I am very happy someone bought me this tub for my baby shower.  We have used it since my baby was sitting on his own and it feels so much safer than having him sit in the big tub alone.  This tub is nice with the soft, inflatable sides so if he were to tip over he wouldn't hit the sides of the bathtub.  And there is plenty of space for him to still have toys to play with.The quacker is pretty cute and my son loves to squeeze the bill to make it quack.  The duck head and tail are rather large but we make a game out of putting toys on the top of the ducks head and he likes to shoot them off by wiggling the head.  I also use the bill of the duck to dry my washcloths.  It's a nice drying rack.  I don't use the suction cup to dry the tub (I actually didn't even know there was a suction cup...oops) I just pull the drain plug then turn the duck upside down to air dry.  I also only use my shower head to fill the tub up so the fact that it doesn't fit under the spout doesn't bother me.  We have been using this tub for 5 months and have not had to refill it with air once.My son is now 23 lbs and about 30" and I think it is about time to retire the duck.  He is starting to run out of space.  I am keeping this duck around for baby#2 though.  I love it!
What a great bathtub at a great price.  Perfect for the transition before they can sit in the tub on their own.  We had planned to use this just for travel but now we are also using as the regular tub for our long six-month-old.  She can sit independently, but we still keep hand on her.  It is so much more comfortable than the mesh sling tub we were using (which was getting smelly despite regular washing).  She loves it!
At first, when I tried the bathtub duck, my daughter was afraid of it. I saw the hole in the duck and thought that I was supposed to fill up the tub, and have the duck float in it while the sucker thing at the bottom stuck to the tub. That is NOT what you are supposed to do with it. When I just filled up the duck, and put it in the tub, she wasn't as near afraid of it as before, and she actually enjoyed it. It was a nice change from our regular bath time rituals, and I will continue to use it. I like this product so much, I would give it as a gift... perfect for a first birthday gift! I also love how the duck tells you when the water is too hot. While water, to us adults, might not FEEL too hot, it could be for our kids, so the duck is very helpful that way as well!
We love this tub at our house! It is perfect for transitioning from infant tub to the "regular" bathtub. It is the perfect size for my little one to sit in and have a bath. She loves her duck tub and will crawl towards it saying "DUCK! DUCK!" It is just big enough for her to play during bath time and it is safe and not overwhelming after being in an infant tub. I highly recommend this and I will be giving it at baby showers in the future! It is easy to clean. It does not use excessive water which I appreciate for ecological and economical reasons! The price is right too. Definitely worth it.
Great solution for large babies. My son was the size of a 2year old by 8 months. By the time he was sitting up on his own he didn't fit in to most bath seats. This saved us as a transition from supported bathing to free-for-all in the tub.
I received it today and was so excited I bought a dual action air pump from a local Target store and inflated it for my son's bath this evening. My six month old baby laughed hysterically watching me inflating the duck tub I was sure he would love it inside as well.  I am now however quite disappointed and am wondering if it could be returned for a full refund.The biggest issue for us is its small size.  Our baby is barely 6 months but at 28.5 inches with fairly long legs.  When he leans at the duck tail, he has to curl his legs.  When he sits up, his feet are reaching the duck neck.  At this rate in a few weeks' time this tub would be too small already.Not to mention that because it's small, my son was able to reach out of the duck tub, and bang his head on the real tub (ouch!)Then some inconveniences:  1st, we put this tub inside a real bath tub.  You can't fill this duck tub from the spout directly (unless you have an extra long spout I guess) so that's quite inconvenient. 2nd, the baby would sit towards the duck tail, and the adult would need to wash him over the duck head, and that is a pretty big duck head... I'm wondering maybe the adult should be standing outside of the real tub but then you'd need to bend over.Perhaps the best thing to do is to lay this duck tub on the bathroom floor, and the adult can sit on a stool while washing the baby inside of it.  That though, I can guarantee, will make a very wet floor as our baby loves to play with water.
Pros:-Versatile as a toy and great for beach.  It's pretty darn cute and makes for a great toy.  My baby has outgrown it as a tub, but it's sitting in his playroom as a boat, a fort, something for him to load his toys in and push around, etc!  During the summer we also took it to the beach a few times because I needed something for him to sit in (the ocean would have been too cold and scary)-GREAT for travel!!!  If we ever need to stay over somewhere, we take it with us as it's easy to pack up and blow up/use.-Good quality, sturdy materials.  The one I got is very sturdy and has thick, durable material.  My toddler is ROUGH with his toys too, during playdates he and his friends jump in and out of the tub, push it around, etc, and it has never leaked.  I might have to occasionally blow it up a little more, but that's only once a month or so, if even that.-Colored temperature indicator is helpfulCons:-hard to fill up.  Because of the thick dimensions of the head and tail, it's really hard to fill it up with water directly unless your faucet is really really far from the wall.  I always had a cup that I would hold under the faucet to redirect the water in, but it was annoying that to fill it up I would have to hold and tilt the cup the entire time (vs. using that time to get the baby ready).-very large!  It takes up a lot of space, and realistically I don't see how it can comfortably fit into a bathroom you're using--you would have to put it on the floor as you use the tub or shower.  We luckily have a spare bathroom for the baby, so I just kept the duck in the tub.-suction cup is worthless.  There is NO WAY it can support the entire ducktub for more than 2 seconds to hang-no squeaker :-( Mine never had one-age range is questionable.  It says it'll go up to 24mos, but my baby maxed out around 12mos (around 27lbs).  He also started moving/standing too much that it became a hazard.Overall, I would highly recommend this, not just as an interim tub but also as a toy/travel tub/beach chair :-)
Honestly, our son had a lot of trouble sitting up.  He still wants to just bend his body forward and dunk his head so we have had to put using this tub on hold.  Currently we are using a bath chair until we feel more comfortable.  However, we did use this tube with our older child and it was a hit.  It made us and her feel much safer and comfortable.  Make sure you clean the bottom frequently or else you will have a mold issue but otherwise I totally recommend.
This tub takes second place in the bath tub category.  Number one goes to the Blooming Bath.  If you are expecting or have a little baby, BUY A BLOOMING BATH!  Anyway, back to the duck.  This was the perfect transition from the Blooming Bath in the sink to the big tub.  It's comfortable for the baby and doesn't require filling the whole bath tub.  At first, my baby was completely content laid back with her head in the corner.  When she started sitting him, it provided a soft back for her.  Now that she's standing, it provides a cushion when she falls!  The bottom is also a grippy material, so it prevents any slipping.  She is 9.5 months and we will probably be moving her to the &#34;big bath&#34; in the next month.  This tub definitely gave us the most bang for our buck!
The inflatable bottom makes this tub extra comfortable for her and it's just the right size in the middle to keep her upright when she gets extra excited slapping the water.The &#34;HOT&#34; safety disk seems to be a little too sensitive to me so we don't pay attention to it - no better gauge of water temperature than your own arm.Honestly, this would even make a perfect little pool for the back porch on a hot day!
This picture makes it look neon green which is the only reason I was hesitant to buy it.  My son is 15 months, 32 inches long and 26 lbs. and this was too small for him.  It's very cute and well made so I will keep this so I can fill it up with water on hot days for him to splash in.
I love this tub for my babies. It's easy to inflate, holds air well, has a nonslip bottom so they are a little more secure as well. The duck "quacks" which my kids love. The "too hot" feature on the bottom is nice too (I don't completely depend on it but it's helpful when choosing a temperature). My baby loves it. My two year old likes it as well which is just fine by me, we'd been bathing her in the "big" tub but this uses less water and she can't slip around or fall like in the big tub.The only thing I don't LOVE is that it's a little hard to fill because both ends are too high to just put under the faucet. It's not super inconvenient though, I just push the tail end a little flatter to fill and since it's small it doesn't take forever to fill or anything. If not for this I'd give it 4 stars.
This is great for our temporary apartment that is bath tub-less! So far after 3 months it is still going strong.
We love the duck! We use a bath pillow and use it for our 4 month old. She really likes it and enjoys looking and the cute ducky.
Our daughter loves this seal tub. I love that we can put this in our normal bathtub to get our daughter used to something other than the baby tub.  She is able to sit upright and it has cusion for when she tilts or leans over.  The drain is in a great spot too.
Once my baby could sit up, this bath was perfect!  Saves on water (you don't have to fill the whole tub) and my baby loves to lounge in it. Good buy!
So I was looking for an alternative to the traditional infant tub, without having to commit to something my kid might not like. She's still too small to use in the big person's tub. This one did the trick. So here are a few things I wanted to point out:1 - it has a plug which is somewhat useful. I can easily drain it by flipping it but it's ok that it is there.2 - I never use the plug because it does take a few to get it fully aligned3 - the quacking beak is nice but my kid can't reach it - so I just squeeze it for her. Initially the sound freaked her out, now she smiles when she hears it.4 - the duck head is huge so you cant put this tub under the tap. However, if you use your hand to direct the water from your tap, you can easily create a spray to fill it. It takes me a minute or less to fill it. So that's not a huge issue.5 - the suction cup isnt that useful. The way the tub is shaped, it would be hard to hang the tub. It also irks me because it gets stuck when I'm done bathing her and want to flip the tub.6 - it's great for washing hair. My little one can just lean back and when I pour water over her hair, it rolls off outside of the tub into my real bathtub.7 - to keep it  dry, I just flip it upside down after her baths.All in all - This tub did everything I needed it to.
I looked for a next step solution for a bath for some time. I finally came across this one because of other reviews and I thought it was cute. When it arrived we blew it up no problem. It would have been helpful to know if the dimensions given were for the whole product or the area that the baby sits. Needless to say, this was much smaller than we thought. There were only a couple of inches of room when my baby girl extended her legs and she was 8 months old. She may be in the 90th percentile for height (only 40's for weight), but she is not a giant. There is no way she would be able to use this for very long.On another note, while this is a very cute tub and I had some fun with the quacking, my daughter did NOT like it at all. She was terrified. I think she thought we were trying to feed her to the duck. haha. So, it is being stored under our sink. Perhaps our next little one won't be scared of it.
Our 5 month baby loves it. And is very practical to any travel, inflates very easy and our baby stays firmly on it with very low risk of drawning. Perfect!
We used this for a fun bath experience for our child.  We even put it outside a few times and gave our child an outdoor bath which was a blast! Our child loved watching the birds while playing in the tub (kind of a bathtub, baby swimming pool)I wouldn't use this until your child can sit up on their own. It doesn't offer to much protection if they were to fall to the sides.
When we headed out of town for a weeklong trip with family, I ordered this tub to meet us there.Our little guy was just 6mos at the time and still needed a tub.This duck was super convenient while there and when we headed home, we let out the air and took it with us.Once at home, we continued using this as his bathtub (in the regular tub) until about 2 weeks ago just after he turned one.It's a bit of a snug fit for up to 2years old, but I could see how it might work. Especially considering the baby stays nicely surrounded by water with MUCH LESS water than filling the tub.After every use, we hung it up to dry and only ever had to top off the air once.EXCELLENT value and usability factor!
Yes, totally adorable, fits nicely in regular sized tub, my daughter loved it. Our first one lasted approximately 3 months before it sprung several air leaks and we had to refill it with air daily. We were very careful with it, so the leaks seem to come from weak seams. We figured we simply had a lemon, and bought a second one. That one also lasted about 3 months, same air leaks. Now they are going to sit in a landfill, which doesn't sit right with us. The second star is only because my daughter was so smitten with the design.I would rather pay much more for something better made. We recently bought a collapsible Karibu tub - yes, more expensive, but MUCH more durable and small space friendly.Karibu Folding Bath - Blue
Graduated my daughter to this tub at about 6 months after she outgrew her infant tub, and we both love it. Sturdy but lightweight, it's perfect!
I receive this tub as a gift before my daughter was born. Didn't use it until now, that she's 6 month old. She ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! The bath time is so fun in it!Update March 2009This is a GREAT bathtub, actually I'm buying this again, because my 2 years old used it so much that my new baby can't use it again...[......]
Love this bath tub for my baby. When he turned 6 months old and was sitting up, I knew I needed something new for him as he had grown out of his infant tub, but was not ready to sit in the big bath tub yet. I like this tub because it provides a soft, comfortable place for him to sit, and the heat sensor is quite useful so that you don't accidentally make the water too hot. Plus, it's only $10, so you can't beat that. You can also take it to the beach, pool, or wherever you want for play-time, too, once the baby outgrows it as a bath tub!
As soon as my son started sitting up on his own, we got this bathtub, and I as well as my son are just absolutely in love! It didn't take long to blow up, and the bottom is "cushy" too so he has something soft and airy to sit on while he plays in the bath. My son is now 15 months, and I still have him in this tub, and plan on using it until he just doesnt fit. I feel that he is a lot safer from slipping and falling in this thing, since he just isn't at the stage of understanding that he might slip and hurt himself if he keeps standing in the tub. The bottom of this thing where your child would be sitting is textured, so not slippery at all. Also, the little piece of plastic on the bottom of the tub that turns white when the water is too hot is a wonderful tool. My son gets so excited at bathtime now ever since we have had this bath tub. It is comfortable, colorful, and just his size. For the price, I highly recommend this little tub for that fun transition period of bathtime.
I used this when my son was 5-11 months in the tub and LOVED it. It is adorable and the pictures I have gotten with my son in it are priceless!Now that he is bigger and does not need it in the tub (1 year old), he sits in it when he watches TV (not too long-I know that is bad!!:) He is super comphy and safe.You will never regret buying this! One of my top ten baby products.
A great product! I loved not having to worry if my baby would fall over and hit the tub. It provided a soft comfy barrier. And she loved that it was a duck. It's so wonderful for that price. And it really is a great transition to the big bath tub.A definite must buy.
I received this tub as a shower gift and I love it!It's ideal for when your baby becomes a sitter. The hot indicator at the bottom, also a plus.. I would say a must for first time parents. It helped my husband and I tremendously..it kept me from making the water too hot, and my husband  making the water too cold. Bath time is an ESSENTIAL part of our bedtime routine, so tub time must be both relaxing and fun, or both baby and parent get frustrated.My daughter is now 10 months and still using this tub, but it's time to get a longer one or use our bathtub. She's over 28 inches long and starting to get too tall/long for this one.This tub provided us the ease of bathing her in our bedroom..less back bending, and less chance of injury.But if you have a &#34;splasher&#34; then the bedroom is not an option.Used inside your bathtub, or alone..this tub is the way to go. Happy bathing everyone!
I found this at Target and decided to try it out for my parent's house. It was really cheap and cute so it wasn't a hard decision. I liked it so much I bought one for my house.Pros:- Easy to inflate. I did it all by myself. It didn't take long at all and I didn't feel dizzy afterwards.- There's a suction cup so you can hang it up once you're done. This works well in a big bath tubs or shower stalls.- Soft surface so your babe can rest his little head on the side of the duck as your wash his hair.- The bottom of the tub is ribbed so you have a lot of friction, preventing your baby from slipping.- the hot temperature sticker is great. However on my mom's tub it's very sensitive.- The beak makes a cute "quack quack quack" sound.Cons:- Sometimes I wish the duck's head was detachable. It can get in the way sometimes but it's not a big deal.Bottom line: I would buy this again for a friend or myself if needed.
My son loves it.  He also likes to play in it while it's empty.  Throw a few toys in and it's a fun play place!
I bought this tub when my son was 6 months old - it was perfect for when he was getting too big for the sink and was not sturdy enough to sit up on his own in the big tub. Also great as a mini pool outside on those hot summer days!! Just the right size to cool off. Don't waste your money on the sit-up bath seats that look like booster seats - the hard plastic is very uncomfotable on little ones! A great value and it deflates for easy storage when your child outgrows it.
So, being a new mom, I looked at all of the reviews on Amazon for baby bathtubs and I thought that if everyone loved the Primo Eurobath, I'd get that one, even though it didn't look so great to me! Well, I should've listened to my instincts, because when I got the tub, it seemed HUGE, but I tried it anyway....and my daughter HATED it! It didn't matter that I kept my hands and arms close to her the whole time, or how I tried to soothe her - she screamed and cried and screeched so much through the FEW baths that I gave her (and seemed genuinely scared) that I ended up giving her sink-side sponge baths for the past 18 months (and, yes, I did try the Primo repeatedly, as recently as several weeks ago)!! I wasn't sure if I'd EVER be able to get her to take a bath, but then I thought that maybe an inflatable tub might be worth a shot, esp if it were somewhat smaller (and would possibly make her feel more supported and secure). Well, when I saw this one, I thought it couldn't be more perfect, because it's cute and would probably help distract her a little bit, especially since it quacks (via an electronic device in the beak)! WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF FIRST LAYING EYES ON THIS TUB, SHE ACTUALLY LET ME PUT HER IN IT (FIRST SITTING ON THE SIDE WITH HER FEET IN THE WATER), AND WITHIN 10 MINUTES SHE WAS IN IT AND ACTUALLY ENJOYING IT!  I also bought her the Crayola floating art desk ($[...]), and she LOVED that! So, between the new ducky tub and her bath crayons, my daughter, who HATED bathtime since she was born, is now happily playing in the bath every night!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PRIMO EUROBATH!! EVEN IF THIS ONE SPRINGS A LEAK FOR SOME REASON (which mine hasn't yet, but I read that in some of the reviews), I'LL JUST BUY ANOTHER ONE IF I CAN'T REPAIR IT! SOOOOO WORTH THE MONEY IF IT GOT MY DAUGHTER TO ENJOY BATHING!
Wonderful for transition from infant tub to big tub! My 10 month old enjoys watching me fill his &#34;big duckie&#34; with water when it's time for bath time. He also enjoys playing with the duckie even when it's not bath time. I have definitely got my money's worth!
I wasn't sure about this one, but i must say it is amazing for traveling. It makes his bath time fun!
My product did not come by the recommended date but after e-mailing the customer service they were extremly promt in correcting the issue and keeping me informed of the situation. Everything was wonderful and the duck is excellent.
I would love to write a good review about the cute little duck bath tub, but it arrived with a visible hole in it!So i can't comment on the functionality of it when water is placed into it:( so we purchased a different animal bathtub. Oh! the beak quacks though...
We previously had a SnugTub and it got a hole in it after about 5 months of use. Thought we would try something different. Be aware that this tub has less space inside for baby then the Snug Tub... seems a little small for a 1-year old, but it's working ok.
My daughter loved this tub (and the quacking). After 12 months she was ready for a non-slip adult tub though.
Purchased this as my 7 month old son outgrew his baby bath but wasn't quite stable enough for the big bath without some serious help.  He was sliding all over the place, which was making bath time dangerous.  This ducky is cute and does a great job of keeping him contained.  I can clean baby instead of holding him up!!  And, we just brought it on vacation.  It deflates and inflates pretty easily.  Love it and would buy another, need be, at this price.  Yes, it may be slightly difficult to fill with water cuz of the tail and head position, but the baby tub we used to use had the same issue.  It's not a problem or reason not to get this item.  Just buy it-- you will be happy you did.
We loved this tub for bath time and for hot summer days outdoors. The kids loved it too!  We always felt safe putting them in this tub and we saved space in the bathroom by attaching it by suction to the shower walls when it wasn't in use.
The cuteness factor on this thing is off the charts, but it's also super easy to blow up, fill with water, and use at bath time. The bottom has a texture so that the baby won't slide around, and the duck's tail is nice for leaning his head back to wash/rinse. It's a bit smaller than I hoped, but I've come to terms with its size because the smallish size means that the baby can brace his legs against the sides to aid in sitting up, which is helpful. And if it was much wider it probably wouldn't fit in my tub. The suction cup on the bottom doesn't work, but I prefer to let it dry flipped over, anyway. For the price, it's a great buy!
All hail the ducky tub. I bought this when my daughter got too big for the sink and could sit up on her own. I think the ducky tub took a lot of fear out of transitioning from the sink to the tub.  My daughter likes that it is big enough for her splash around in and stretch her legs out in but small enough that she feel safe. I really wanted to avoid the plastic seats since in my experience most kids tend to figure out how to tip them over or don't like feeling confined, hit their heads, or any various things. This tub solved all those problems, it is soft so baby can't hit her head and get hurt, it is stable so it won't flip, slide, or rock. It has a nonslip bottom on the inside of the tub so if baby does manage to stand up then she is less likely to slip. The water temperature indicator is great, it eliminates another piece of equipment, it has a drain, it dries quickly, can suction cup hang for drying and it can deflate for easy storage or travel. It doesn't get much better than that! Some reviews said the duck squeaks but mine doesn't but that's okay we have bath toys for that reason. I have had this tub for four months now and have had no problems with it. I keep it inflated all the time and have only had to add a little air once or twice.
This is such a super bath tub, my son had a "posh" spa tub bought for him which was great for the first few months when he would lie down. The problem was he couldn't sit and splash very well as the sides were hard. I bought the duck tub after reading lots of reviews. He has such fun bath time now, he sits in it very well, splashing and playing. He is 26" and slim (preemie baby) but there is lots of room to spare and if he does fall back he bounces off the sides. The duck's beak quacks which he loves too. The only reason i gave 4 stars is, as with many other reviews, the bottom of the tub is not well designed for my little chap, i bought the sea turtle sponge (Toys r us $6) and it fits perfectly on the bottom without the bottom inflated.  Our tub has not deflated at all and we've had it 2 months!
This bath is the best!Have one that has been used nearly every day for a year and still looks great and works well.Bought an extra bath for travel and sleepovers at granparents. Love this bath.No slipping and getting hurt.
This is a great bathtub- I can't believe how inexpensive it is compared to many others.  I love the nonskid bottom too. I didn't have a problem with the tub fitting under the faucet in the bathtub like other  people.
I love how easy it is to use and drain. It is so soft for the baby so they don't hit their head in the tub if they lean over, and I like that its on the small side as it keeps them safer from slipping into the water. It helps baby sit up. I was going to buy a bath seat fro baby but it appeared too difficult to clean the dirtiest spots on her body, so I opted for this It is inexpensive and allows for easy body cleaning. Baby can splash in her little tub! We love it!
We got this as a christmas present but my daughter was to big to take a bath in it HOWEVER we put her in it to slide herdown a hill in the snow and it worked amazingly!She had so much fun in it,its really durable and easy to blow up and use. the hot indicater actuly got a darker blue on the snow. :) so I think its wonderful.
This is such a great tub and our son loves it! He gets very excited when we tell him it's &#34;Rubber Ducky time!&#34; it's great to take on vacation so you don't have to bath him in someone else's tub. I can't recommend it enough. The hot indicator is a little on the over sensitive side, but I just test the water myself ot make sure it's not too hot!We've had it inflated for months now and it has not lost it's firmness or needed any added air!
We had this duck bath tub from July to November of the same year. We only used it that long because it acquired holes somehow. I'm assuming the holes just came about due to normal wear on the vinyl around the seams. However, while the duck bath tub was in use, it was exactly what we needed. I didn't need to worry about any hard surfaces and the beak of the duck would "quack" which was so cute! We even took the duck with us on vacation, it rolled up so nicely and was perfect!I would recommend this bath tub to be used only for vacationing since it really is not very durable in the long run. A plastic baby to toddler tub would be more suited for a permanent bath tub at home so you don't need to worry about it getting holes and having to replace it a couple of times a year.
I have been using this pump since I returned to work several months ago, and it has been great.  It's very easy to use.  It's completely quiet and discreet, and requires no electrical source, so it's convenient to use at work.  It's small and light-weight, so I can carry it with me anywhere.  The pump action is efficient and comfortable, allowing me to pump 6-10 oz of milk in just 10-20 minutes without any soreness.  I have total control over the pumping process, so I can apply the suction a little longer if I am flowing heavily, and pump more if I'm not.  It takes only a couple of minutes to disassemble and clean (I would DEFINITELY recommend the Avent Steam Sterilizer as well - makes sterilizing incredibly easy).  My only complaint is that usually 4 oz bottles aren't big enough to hold all the milk from one session of pumping, and it's a pain to have to switch bottles midway through.  I bought a couple of the Avent 9 oz bottles, though, and they work great.The long and short - this pump has worked just as well for me if not better than an electrical pump, and for a fraction of the cost.  I totally recommend it.
This is a great little pump.  It is affordable, which is one of the features that makes it is great (having a baby, especially the 1st one, is expensive enough).You can use the Avent bottles and magic cups interchangably for milk storage, so there are fewer things you have to wash.  This is awesome because there isn't much time for working around the house with a new baby.This pump also stores quite well in the Avent microwave steam sterilizer.  After sterilizing it, I just leave it in the sterilizer.  I know it's out of the way and I also know where all of the parts are.Get some extra sealing discs.  I had a ton of bottles, so I didn't want to spend the extra money for the breast milk storage containers.  I just about a pack of the sealing discs that fit the bottles (in this case Avent because that's what I have).  It is a great way to get more use out of those bottles.I noticed that there are extra parts available for this pump.  I haven't had to purchase them, but I am really glad to know that they are available, should some part need to be replaced.
I wanted this breastpump because I am a huge Avent customer.  Unfortunatley, breast milk always got between the suction and the funnel (which enables the breastpump to pump).  If you're going to spend money, then spend it on a more accurate pump.
I bought this pump when my son was 3 weeks old.  I've been pumping fairly regularly for 4 months now and wouldn't think of using anything else.  I've returned to work and my son is exclusively breastfed.  I had the idea that I would use this for the occasional pumping to get me started and then I would buy a hospital grade pump.  I won't use anything else after my sucess with this pump.  I can pump an 8-9oz bottle in 10 to 15 minutes with no problem.I recommend this pump to anyone who plans on nursing - short term or long term.
I used the Medela, and it works well. Nice to double pump - but what a pain in the long haul. This little pump was excellent. It was easy to travel with, store in diaper bag and use wherever I needed to use it. I discovered it after 6 months of nursing and using the Medela. Next time I will just use the Avent ISIS. Also, the company was excellent to work with. I had a problem with the pump, from my own fault. They shipped me the part overnight at their own expense. There were so kind and supportive of getting the part in my hands so I could continue to pump & nurse.It is worth every penny!
This is the perfect pump for working mothers (or if you just want to pump so you can rest at least once a week!). I recommend buying this version because it is cheaper than the disposable version. If you want the bags for storage, just go out and buy them. The back to work version can be easily put together with a small cooler and some ice packs. Also, don't try to pump before two weeks! It will hurt because you don't really have alot of milk to pump. Finally, you need to hold in the pump before attaching it to your breast otherwise it will hurt. My sister told me that. After getting the hang of it, I can pump four ounces in about 15 minutes or less.
I bought this because I read good reviews and I liked how the Avent bottles mimic the breast.  I got the kit that had the insulated bag and it came with a few 4 oz and 9oz bottles.  I love this for the following:-It's small and easy to carry. With the black insulated bag noone but friends know I have a breast pump in it. The bag easily holds the pump and 2 full bottles, maybe even 3.-Easy to clean, there are hardly any parts!-I can control the suction!-I get a ton of milk.I was getting about  4 oz in 15 minutes on this doing one breastI thought I could get more so bought a pump in style and I was getting 1 oz per breast in 20 minutes.  They say electric is best , not always true.  However Medela has the custom shields, I had to also buy a size bigger.  With the Avent I just take out the flowered soft cup and use it as is and I am fine.  I was using the large Medela ones.
Do not buy this. We bought it, tried to use it, and threw it away.  Avent Products contain BPA which is toxic for your baby. Dont poison your child with these toxins.  Avent has to re-engineer their products.
It is comfortable to use, easy to put together, and compact to carry around. I have pumping for 2 months to store milk for when I return to work. I can pump about 3-4 oz in 10-15 min. No complaints
I just had my second baby and am still using my original Isis breast pump that I used with my first child four years ago.  I only pump occasionally so I don't know about using it for expressing many bottles.  For what I have used it for it has been great and is very easy to use and clean.  I am able to get a 4-6 oz. bottle in 10-15 min. and the Isis is very comfortable to use.  I use mine with the disposable system and freeze milk for whenever I need it.
I registered for this pump because I planned to only pump on rare occasions, so I thought it would be silly to spend the money for an electric pump... Big Mistake. This manual pump takes much longer to assemble, has more parts to clean and reassemble, and pumps significantly less milk than the Medela DoubleEase I replaced it with. Granted, there is a big difference in price, but when you're only getting 2 hours sleep at a time, the laundry is piling up, you haven't had time to go to the store or prepare dinner, and you haven't even had the energy to bathe yourself (welcome to motherhood), it seems worth the extra money to me to have a pump I can assemble in less than 10 seconds, get 4 oz. of milk in 5 minutes, and still have one arm free to hold baby.
Recently, while on vacation I misplaced the membranes for my "Medela, Pump In Style Breast pump", which are vital for operation.  The spare parts were safe at home, and with a hungry boy on my hands, I was in a predicament.  Unable to nurse, I have provided my son with breast milk by pumping three times a day since birth.  I was concerned about maintaining my milk supply, not to mention the discomfort of very full breasts, so I purchased the Isis Breast pump because I use Avent products and liked the idea of being able to pump right into the feeding bottle, 4-ounce, 9-ounce or disposable.  I am amazed by the comfort, control and power this little hand pump provides.  In addition, I enjoy the convenience of not having to be "plugged in" and the reduced amount of bottles to wash.  I found this pump to be great in a pinch, or for a weekend away.  However, for my particular situation having to express 30 ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy, the "Pump In Style" is superior to the Isis in both speed and quantity of milk expressed.
This pump works better for me then the one from the hospital!  It's very easy to use and clean and I love that it attatches to the bottles so I can give it right to my baby or throw it in fridge for later. It pumps pretty quickly and is easy to travel with.
This pump works great. It isn't noisey like some of the electric pumps and can be easily assembled and used. My only complaint doesn't deal with the pump, it deals with the bottles. When going from breast to bottle, my daughter hated the avent nipple. She threw a fit when i tried to feed her. Now I pump my milk into the avent bottle and dump it into the playtex nurser bottle, which my daughter has taken to without a problem.
This pump advertises that it's design stimulates let-down, and that is not the case. This pump will pull and tug at your nipple just as much as the next one, and because it's clear, you can see how much of your PRECIOUS breastmilk has been lost and stuck in the mechanical aspects of the pump. You'd have more volume and less pain if you hand-express.
I used this pump when I had problems breastfeeding (which gave my baby the food/nutrition he needed).  However, later I needed to pump regularly, and I had to switch to an electric pump.  It's not realistic to use this if you are strictly pumping, but it works great and is very comfortable when I needed it for a couple times a day.  It's also great to draw out inverted nipples if this is a problem for you
I can't believe all the great reviews. Maybe its just me, but I think this pump is so overrated. The pluses: it is small, it does work OK sometimes. The negatives: it takes a long time to pump even a small amount, it has a lot of parts.And the worst one is that the plastic star valve keeps coming off, which requires taking it apart in the middle of pumping,while its leaking everywhere. I rented the Medela for 2 months before using it and believe me this thing does not compare, not even close. I use it only occasionally and it drives me crazy even than. There has to be a better hand pump out there. This is my personal opinion, so your resluts could be totally different
Bought the Avent Isis Breast Pump in addition to the Medela Pump In Style Advance.  I use the Avent pump when traveling for the day without baby.  I also use it when breast feeding baby on other breast.  It is great for times when you don't want the Medela pump making that loud noise that it does and don't want to lug around a big pump.  I recommend it be used in addition to a pump like Medela.
I use this pump all the time- for 95% of my baby's feedings.  I actually have 2 of them.  I keep one in the car with a clean bottle at all times and one in the house.  The pump is easy to clean, and comes with spare parts.  This manual pump is comfortable to use.  I know that all of the experts recommend electric pumps, but I have done just fine using this manual pump and saved a ton of money over the electric pumps.  The Avent bottles fit directly only this pump, so it's quick and simple to take the full bottle off the pump and either freeze it with a sealing disc, feed your baby by putting on a nipple top, or store it in the fridge with a nipple top & storage cap.  I must note however that 1 of my pumps is the older version of this model and the other is the newest version.  The newest and current version leaks a little where the screw on grooves from the pump meet the bottle, as the older version with a different part did not.  So, just be a bit careful when using this otherwise you'll have drops of milk on your clothes!
I too have the Medela Pump in Style but lets be honest even though it is in a stylish bag...it is still a big bag. This pump is in a nice small bag. And Works SO WELL!! I was thourghly impressed infact I am thinking of buying a second so that I can use two at once. I think that is the only drawback my Medela can do both at once...this one can but you'd have to buy two. I felt like this expressed more milk and made my breast feel better and emptier faster then the automatic Medela.When Traveling I always reached for my Avent breast pump due to size convienence and the way it worked. It is easy to clean and easy to put together and use..overall Perfect!I just took a breastfeeding class awaiting the birth of my second son and they were pushing Medela products and Medela has come out with a pump identical to this Avent that is small and portable and stylish that has better suction too... AND of course is more then this Avent one. So even the competition sees who is on top of things!!You will not regret the purchase
I've heard so many rave reviews that when I lost my Purely Yours, I got this one (my son was not nursing so often by then). I was disappointed. My hand hurt from having to squeeze the pump. I guess I should expect that, given that it's a handheld manual pump. Well, I didn't think it would be that tiring. Both my hands were tied up when pumping both sides. The suction was too much. It would release, so I had to let air in every so often so my nipples wouldn't get sucked into the bottle! Well, it wasn't that bad, but it really wouldn't release. The output wasn't what I'd like, either. Maybe I'm just used to the electric variety. This pump would be okay for light pumping but not for working moms.
The Isis Breast Pump is perfect for the Breastfeeding Stay-at-home Mom.  I used it a lot in the early months to relieve heavy engorged breasts and to help establish a good milk supply.  With this pump I was able to keep a plentiful stock of breastmilk in my freezer.  Now that my little guy is one year old, I only use it a couple of times a week but with good results.  This helps me maintain a full supply.I cannot imagine using this pump for large quantities on a regular basis.  If I was working outside the home, I would definately purchase a good electric pump.  The results, in my opinion, would be less tiring on your hand and much faster.  Using this pump would be way too time consuming...we moms know how precious time is when you have a baby to care for.5 stars for its effectiveness as a "relief" pump or to establish a mini-stock.  It encourages the "let-down" reflex necessary to get an effective flow to begin the pumping process.  The Isis, I have found to be much better than electric brands available in most baby departments. It is also easy to use one handed as sometimes I would pump one side while baby was nursing on the other.I am happy to have found this little pump.  It has served me well for over a year now.The ideal pump for the semi-regular pumping needs of any Work/Stay-at-home breastfeeding mom!
Well I somehow ended up getting the Isis manual Breast Pump in the mail for free & the only thing I can say is that I'm glad I didn't shell out money for this pump!  It's terrible.I sat for about 15 minutes trying to pump either breast & I think I succeeded in getting a drop to appear on one nipple! lol  I could see the suction was working, but not particularly strong & it didn't do a thing.I read the other reviews & I guess it depends on the person as some people obviously have no problems & others can't get the darn thing to work at all.  So if at all possible I would advise borrowing one from a friend to try out first to see if you can have any success before purchasing this pump.
I am a stay-at-home mom and pump 4-5 times a week just to produce some supplemental bottles for my time away from baby.  I have found the Isis to be perfectly adequate for this purpose.  It's been comfortable, easy to use, and easy to clean.  Usually takes me about 10-15 minutes to produce 4 ounces.  A working mom or someone who needs to pump exclusively would probably want to look at an electric model for better efficiency, however.
I choose this over the hospital pump. At first I could not get any suction, but you have to use the thing right to get any!!! After I realized a part was on wrong I would not leave the house without it. This pump is the best!!!! I was pumping so much milk out by day 4 (after delivery) that our son is now 4 months old and we still have tons of frozen milk in the fridge. The pump is easy to use, has a comfy grip, and small to carry around. Also very few parts, although one part is very very small and is a hassel to keep track of. We were going to buy an electric breast pump once out of the hospital but once I started using the Isis I wanted to spend the money on other things that I needed.
First of all, the boppy pillow is amazing.  A "must have" for all breastfeeding moms, and a "definately could use" for everyone with young infants!  This pillow is wonderful when breastfeeding to take the pressure off you back, and keep you and baby comfortable!  When baby is newborn (0-5 months) it is awesome for promoting "tummy time", and stregnthening baby's neck and back muscles.  When baby is ready to be propped to sitting, the boppy is there to support them, and cushion any tipsy falls.  The Boppy Pillow is a wonderful product.This particular boppy pillow (rosebud luxe) is so luxurious and comfy - the cover is thick and soft and so snuggly for my little angel.  And it is, of course, SO girl!  I love it!
I am not a fat woman, but when I've just given birth to a baby, I'm not a SKINNY woman, either. Boppy Pillows are designed for SKINNY women. If you aren't super-skinny, you will never get that pillow around your waist. If you are skinny, I'm sure this is a great product.I did find my Boppy was useful for sitting my baby inside, as he was learning to sit up. It supports them all around from falling.
I love my boppy! It was great when I breastfed my baby. The pattern is also so cute! If you bottle feed, like I do now, using the boppy is a great way to still be close to your baby during feeding time. Both cover and pillow can be thrown into the washer and dryer if you get any spills on it. The pillow is also very comfy and I like that because my daughter can eat and be comfortable at the same time.
came as described, cute, functional, great price
This tub is great!  It fits perfectly in my kitchen sink!  I love the non-skid areas - they really work and the tub has been perfect since my baby was newborn.  It's easy to clean too!  I liked the look of it better than a lot of the other ones because you can easily reach the baby's whole body to bathe her.  So, get this one - it works very well and is a good buy.
Great for both smaller (newborn) and/or larger babies. The "hammock" only really works with small/newborn babies. Tub is sturdy, reversible (inclined or sitting positions), and can be mounted on some kitchen sinks.My son grew out of his "newborn" tub REALLY fast (3-months-old), so I bought this as a replacement because it was the only one I could find that was big enough for him to bathe in comfortably (and he was still not ready for the adult tub).  Then after a couple more months, he really enjoyed being able to sit up (when he was able) instead of being reclined the whole time, which made bath-time a LOT easier.  The two different sides (reclining/sitting) really extend the life of this tub and it is an excellent value.
I used the mesh sling until my baby was 6 months. I keep the sling tight from the get go. Baby was small at 6lbs so the tight sling keep baby in place while I washed. I used the baby tub in an over sized stainless steel ONE bowl sink which allowed the tub to sit on the floor of the deep sink. I keep water from faucet flowing over baby w/ an over sized washcloth to keep baby warm. The raised sling allowed me to wash baby thoroughly and rinse baby w/o the baby ever sitting in dirty water. As baby grew the sling slouched w/ the baby's weight so I always left it alone. The sling started in the tightest position and stayed there.THERE IS AN INFANT SIDE AND TODDLER SIDE FOR SITTING- READ THE TUB.After 6 moths and baby could sit up well alone, I put baby on the infant side w/o any issues. At 9 mos baby could sit on either side w/o issues but I found the infant side easier for bathing. I would lift drain after washing top to bottom and the rinse baby down w/ my kitchen sprayer and water drained out so baby was clean. I loved bathing baby in the tub in our kitchen sink b/c it was just easier.My only complaint was this was not any good for me after my baby started standing at almost 1 year. MY situation- Since baby was turning on the water and faucet being on the side meant water flooded the countertops and I was fearful baby would push water open on the hot temp. I tried to move this tub into the regular tub w/o success. Baby screamed like a banshee. Showering w/ baby in baby bathtub did not work either; sitting on floor next to baby bath tub in shower just made baby stand and come to us. I am just letting parents know this MIGHT not work for your toddler. The "growing into it" might not happen.Ultimately I had to use the shower sling I was using w/ baby at the gym after we went swimming, our gym has shower seats. Using the shower sling and my own shower seat allowed me to safely bathe baby for months. This worked best/ was safest when I showered first, my spouse brought baby to me, and then spouse took baby to dry and dress- It became family time together.Finally found inflatable baby bath tub that baby likes and fits 18 month old http://www.amazon.com/Secure-Transitions-Inflatable-Baby-Tub/dp/B002YQPDFK/ref=sr_1_1?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1359843074&sr;=1-1&keywords;=one+step+ahead+bathtub. Now we have option of bathing baby alone in an inflatable baby bath tub safely inside the adult tub.
This is a great bathtub!  I use it for my one month old right in our big tub, it's perfect.  I started using the sling feature but my baby loves being in the water so I put her right in the tub and it works out well.  I, too, wish there was a bigger space for clean water, but this is a great product!
I didn't have a large enough sink to initially bathe my son inside of, so we opted for buying a portable tub. I must say, this was the easiest way of bathing a newborn baby! I love that it comes with a little hammock so that they little ones that can not support themselves up can rest and relax in the tub. I also love the little shelf where you can put your products inside, so that they're not all scattered around when you need them. We've even taken this tub for when we go out of town and it's just so convenient. My son is now 7 months old and he still loves taking a bath in this. He gets really excited for bath time and I honestly think it's because of how comfortable this tub is. I highly recommend it!
This fits perfectly in our double bay sink. I did not really like using the sling so I just put less water in it and had him sit in it.
I put this on my baby registry and received it as a gift and I really like it. We only used the sling for a few weeks since he got heavy enough and started weighing the sling down and it would hit the bump on the bottom where they sit on. But now he just sits in this tub at 6 weeks old and he loves it! He almost always falls asleep! lol He doesn't slip because it has that foamy padding on the back and he stays in place by sitting on that "bump" It's super comfy. I'll be using this tub for a while.
There were 2 baby bath tubs that I was looking at the Sassy bath tub and this one.  I decided to go with this one because it was about the same price and had 2 more features: the sponge bath cradle thing for newborns with bellybutton cords and it converted to a toddler tub.  I like how it fits in sinks of different sizes, whether a double sink or a single kitchen sink.  I don't see using this much for a toddler because you would want to get them a little more accustomed to a big bath tub, but maybe for an older baby.  The bath accessories holder is great, so you have all the things you need to make baby squeaky clean right at hand.I would suggest putting this tub over the sink so that your dominant hand can wash baby and your other hand can hold baby.
We weren't sure what to get when I was pregnant since this is our first baby, but this seemed like a good idea.  We are so glad we chose this tub.  It fits perfectly in the kitchen sink.  The newborn sling is great, especially since our baby was only 5 1/2 pounds when she was born and would have gotten lost in the tub without it.  Once she got bigger, and could hold her head up, we took the sling out and used the tub in one direction.  Now that she can sit up on her own, she sits in the tub in the other direction, so it has grown with her.  There is padding on the bottom to help prevent slipping, and the plug changes color if the water is too hot.  I know other mommies who have stated that they wished they had gotten this tub instead because of all these features.
This tub is just ok. It supports him well (we started it as soon as his cord fell off and he is 6 months now). We did not use the mesh part. My biggest rub with this tub is that water collects in some parts. If you do not tip it over and let it fully dry after each use, a slimy film will be left behind. I really feel like it should completely drain all water out. The plug has also left what looks like a rust ring on the bathtub we keep this in.Some of the crevices of the tub are kind of strange and I don't understand why they are there. Look at the pictures, there is a deep fold around either side of the head that my fingers can't even reach the bottom of, so it is hard to clean out if water does collect in there.All in all, the tub works. Baby stays reletivly in place and he does get clean. When you have a baby, you want things to be as easy as possible, and these problems are just annoying. We will be throwing this one away as soon as our son is old enough to bathe in the bathtub. For our future babies, I will be buying the PRI Euro bath, which does not seem to have the strange cavernous crevices.
I was reluctant to register for this tub because it was so affordable.  But it is GREAT! I don't know what I would've done without it because it comes with a net to place newborns in...and their heads are so wobbily, you really can't do without it.
After reviewing many online reviews for tubs, I chose this one for my registry.  We have loved it since day 1!!!  Although I didn't really need the mesh part (for when you do sponge baths - it's just easier to do on a towel), we really enjoy this tub.  Ash used the reclining part until she was about 6 months old and able to sit pretty well straight up.  Now she uses the regular bath part and loves it.  It's a great size and easy to clean.  Highly recommend it.
I picked this for my daughter... the only 2 things I didn't like are1) the "hammock" for a newborn hangs to high, it was ackward for her as a new born, it didn't cradle her enough she she startled at every little movement.2) it does NOT fit every sink!  It was to wide for my sink so we had to use it on the counter top.  Plus the drain plug is right in the middle of the base, this made it difficult to drain from the counter,Otherwise this worked well once she was big enough to prop on the infant side, the hump/bump in the middle kept her bottom in place.  Once she could sit alittle we moved to the other side so she could sit and splash.  She is tall, so she out grew it at about by 9 months old plus she began trying to standup in it.I still recommend this one because of the shape of the bottom is the most convent for a 1 month old to a 8 mo old
The newborn cradle is a must for any new parent.  My one month old baby girl is perfectly snuggled as if she was on a hammock.  It is machine washable and very easy to clean.  I was able to put her on the newborn side where she was at just the right angle for her bath.  It's very sturdy and easy to clean and the compartment for holding soap, etc is very convenient.  The temperature plug really isn't necessary because I don't know many parents that wouldn't test the water first with their elbow or wrist.  Overall, it's a good tub that has proven good support thus far.
My daughter is 4 months old, and I still love this tub. The sling was so nice in the beginning. Now she is using the infant reclined seat, but I left the sling attached at that end, so the foam would give extra padding. She kicks and plays now! She loves it. I use it in the bathtub, because we have a heater in the bathroom, and our kitchen is a bit cool for winter baths. It will be great as she grows though; I won't have to buy a bath seat for a while, if ever. I can just use this!
My Sister used this tub when she was in her apartment.. they bearly used it... its gently used and well they liked it in there apartment but he out grew it to quicky! its a good buy if you have a small house/apartment!! we liked it for the first few time he got a bath...once he out grew the tub he was placed in the big boy bath tub and he loves it!! and he loves to splash water every where and there's no one to keep him in this toddler tub its a great buy... and we loved it at the beginning of  his bath times!!
i like the tub but my daughters hiney slides too much when i try to put her in the infant side.  the hamock is wonderful and i use it more than just the tub.  but when i put her in the infant side, she slides down.  they should have put one of those pads they have on the back part on the bottom also
This is a great tub! My son fits really well in the newborn sling and it holds him steady so he doesn't flop around. It's made bath time much more enjoyable for my son and myself.
This is the second tub I've had.  This one is better than the last (about 12 years ago).  It has the baby net thing that helps hold a newborn in place.  I still support his head with my hand (at 5 weeks old).  The rubber mat helps the tub walls feel warmer (rather than having the baby's skin right on cold plastic).  It also helps keep baby from slipping and adds a little padding.  The end has a cubby thats great for holding baby wash and washcloths.  The drain plugs shut and opens easily.  It fits perfectly in my sink and is easy to empty.
We just began using this with our 6 wk old.  Fits nicely into our sink & holds infant well in sling.  Only issues I have are that it is a space hog and the drainage hole doesn't get rid of all water.  Could have a better drainage system.
I had originally registered for another tub bit it was a major dissapointment. It leaked and it was not a good size for my little man.  I needed a tub that would be good for my very small son.  I decided on this tub and I have to say I am very happy.  This tub comes with a sling that can be used while they are newborn and thenyou can remove it and then use the tub in the other two positions that is made for.  Great tub and worth every penny  My son loves to take his baths in this since the sling makes him feel safe.  The other tub he cried like life as we know it was ending.
I was given this tub as a shower gift.  I luv it!  I had registered on Babie's R Us' website for a collapsable tub to make storage easier, and someone also gave that to me.  But in reading some reviews on it, some people said it leaked....well back to the store that went (unopened).  I kept this one because I liked the idea of the sling for a newborn and I liked the fact that it has the stopper that is supposed to change color if the water is too hot.  Well my daughter hated taking a bath in the sling.  Each time I put her in it, she looked terrified as if she was going to fall out of it.  Eventually, she started to hang a leg off the sling as if to brace herself (it was kinda funny to see her doing that :).  But I finally decided, enough is enough and started giving her baths without the sling and she now likes to take a bath.  I like the padding for her back and the contoured floor so she won't slip.  Now, I think she really looks forward to taking a bath.  Also, because of my odd shaped kitchen sink, the tub wouldn't fit into it, so I just set this tub up in her room on her changing table with a towel under it.  It works out really great.  I am very pleased with this tub and now, so is Anisa.
The included sling was perfect when my baby was newborn, the inclined side was great from 2 to 5 months and now that he's 5 months and sits up with support, the seat side works great, too.Lots of room for my 27" inch long baby to kick and splash (I just started putting the tub on the kitchen floor with a towel underneath and let him splash as much as he wants). It fit great in our single sink when he was smaller, too.The insides and edges are smooth, and the "spongy" pads inside help with slippage; I keep my hands on the baby at all times, but when you're rinsing a wiggly baby's hair, holding on to him one-handed, you'll appreciate this feature.I only wish the "fresh water" basin was bigger or that there were 2, one at each end.
I had an evenflo tub with the hard plastic 2 position insert, for my first child. At the time, 5 years ago, it was one of the best tubs. When my second was born we bought 2 other tubs before this tub and we love it!! Of course I wish we had it from the start. Now we are expecting our third and plan to use this tub!! No other will do! Thankfully we still have it.
He's not too big, so this one is just perfect for him. guess I'll need a bigger one after 6 months or so.
This worked out nicely at first.  Although I only gave it 4 stars, because my daughter seems to be comfortable in it for only 2-3 months.  The netting for the tub is very helpful(which you only use the first few weeks), and stress relieving for new parents with a slippery newborn.  It worked well, while it did.
We have been using this tub to sponge bath my newborn and it is great. The hammock keeps him secure. It will easily transition when he is older and we don't need the hammock anymore. The hammock also help up perfectly after throwing in the washer and dryer.
Unquestionably the best bathtub to keep your little baby secure while you use both hands to bathe him.  I was so nervous to give my baby a bath by myself, but after we went and bought this tub, I've never been more confident about it.  The hammock makes him feel very secure.  Great product!
We loved this tub for our newborn. She fit perfectly and securely in the sling. However, she's now three months old and a little big for the sling, but still to small to use the tub without it. It still works fine, but it's a little awkward.
My baby hated this tub (with and without the sling) as did I. At most you can use it for sponge baths but you have to do it quickly or keep the baby covered with washcloths/towels because baby will get cold. I much prefer a tub where the body can be more submerged in warm water. The other thing is that if you plan to use this on a flat surface (like in your own bathtub), the outlet will be plugged so the soapy water doesn't run out. Why let your kid sit in the soap & grime you just washed off? The worst part about this though is that if you plan to use it low to the ground, it's such a hassle. My back and knees were constantly in pain. Plus lifting this thing full of water was bad for my carpal tunnel. I do love that the sling is machine-washable.I ended up happily using the baby diego deluxe bathinette. It's high up off the ground, it has a built-in changing table and drawers for towels, bath toys, etc. It has a hose that lets dirty/soapy water run out while you're still in washing mode but it can be plugged up for fun playing mode. My baby still did not find this one very comfortable until she sat up by herself. I may have even tried the sling from this tub in the baby diego tub.
The quality of this product is fine but we only used it 2 or 3 times and now it's just taking up a lot of space.  It was comfortable for Baby but baby bath tubs in general are a hassle to set up and clean up and store.  We find it easier to simply have Baby bathe with Mommy or Daddy.  This was something we certainly could have done without.  If you're on a budget, we'd recommend asking around for a safe baby bath tub like this one to borrow as we suspect most folks don't use them very long.
We got this tub off our registry and we really like how versatile it is.  When we first brought our son home we would hold him in the football hold and just sponge bathe him but once he got a little older and stronger this tub was FANTASTIC.  You can use the sling when babies are very tiny and sponge them down there.  It easily fits into sinks and has a convenient spot to hold shampoos, soaps, etc.  Once our son was able to sit unsupported we transitioned this tub to our main bathtub.  It easily hold baby in place and has great back support too.  He's still using it at 10 months old.
Baby fits in tub fine and the sling helps keep him propped up, but once he's able to sit up, we'll stop using the sling. The drain plug turns white if the water is too hot, which is useful. The tub has a small shelf/recess for shampoo, towels, etc. that is also useful. The sling is detachable to hang up for drying.The tub fits in our double bowl stainless sink and the faucet (high and curved) fits over it without a problem.Works great, not expensive.
I love this tub because there is a newborn "seat" and an older infant "seat" and my baby likes both.For us, the hammock never worked. It was not great for our newborn (we used the tub without it). When we put her in the hammock, the hammock just wrapped around her.Also, the second time we used it, the non slip pad came unglued. Kind of poor workmanship, but overall the tub works great for twenty bucks. I saw ones in the store at Babies R Us for $50 - no need for that!
This tub is perfect for newborn to infant.  I am not sure yet about the toddler thing because my 9 month old is getting very wiggly and may be promoted from the kitchen sink to the bath tub.  However, I can still use this tub in the bathtub.
We've used this tub nearly every day for the past 14 months, so it has to be good. Transitions easily from newborn to infant to toddler. 'Baby' is now 14 months 25# 32&#34; and getting a bit big so looking for another but will likely get a few more weeks out of it.
I was a bit scared to bath my newborn but this bathtub was perfect. She stayed in the hammock and i was able to give her a full bath without any worry. She is 5 months and i still use the sling as both my hands are free with the sling. Im happy i bought this...and i would recommend this to anyone with  baby on the way.
I love the reviews on this and when it arrived its so cute the shell is a light pink.  Very happy on the color and quality.
This is a great and very effective infant tub. We've been using it for a couple of months and are very happy with it. It is very well made and keeps our baby securely in place while giving him a bath. It's easy to clean and maintain. The only issue that we have with it is that it's a bit bulky. Of you have limited counter space where to place you may not be able to make the best use of it. Also, we found out that there are soem foldable tubs out there, and we wish we had considered one of those instead. They seem much easier to store and carry with you when you go on a trip.
My daughter is 6 weeks old so I cannot comment about the use of the tub for an older baby.  Using the sling for an infant can be challenging/dangerous because it does not really craddle the baby.  My daughter slips down, her feel fall over the sides, and there is not enough give in the fabric for the slind to cup her in.  While I always have my hands on her while she is in the tub, it would be nice to have the sling make her more secure in the torso area so I could have more freedom to actually bathe her.  I found my daughter almost fell out of the sling, and would have if my hand was on her torso. My daughter is a big newborn (10.8lbs) so her size may have something to do with the lack of safety of the sline, but she is not mature enough to sit up in the tub yet.  Just be very careful with the sling and your newborn.
After being unhappy with the baby bath tub we had, I came onto Amazon to find a bathtub with good reviews. This tub is fantastic! We didn't use the newborn insert, but it looks like it will work great for the next kid. The two sides to the tub are perfect- up until my son was able to sit up he reclined comfortably. We were able to place this tub securely in the kitchen sink so we weren't breaking our backs to bathe him. He loves bath time! Now he is 5 months and sitting with minor support, and due to the notch in the bottom of the tub he can sit up without easily falling forward. He splashes until he wears himself out, and then it is time for bed! It's a great tub!
Our baby is almost 2 months old, and we have been using this tub since a few days after she was born.  We really like it.We're still using the sling, because she doesn't sit up by herself very well yet.  It works pretty well.  It keeps her from sliding or falling into the water, yet it is easy to wash her.  She likes to dangle her right leg into the water, over the side of the sling.  I think that's pretty cute.This tub fits our kitchen sink perfectly.I have only a couple minor complaints:First, there is a bump in the middle of the tub, and the way the sling is, I think the bump pushes into my baby.  It looks kind of uncomfortable, although it doesn't seem to bother her.Second, when I drain the tub, the water does not completely drain out just by opening the little drain.  I also have to pour the tub out after it finishes draining.  So, you can't leave it to dry; you have to set it somewhere else...which, why would I want to have to set a wet tub somewhere else in my house?  It would be nice if the inside of the tub was just slightly, slightly sloped towards the drain so that the water would drain on its own.In general, though, we are very happy with this product.  We don't have a bathtub, so this is one of the baby products that we use most often.
The little cradle it comes with makes bathing our newborn so much easier! and now that she's a little bigger we can put her in the tub and we love the non slip grip it has so she doesnt slide! there is also a seprate space for extra water for rinsing clean.
My baby is now almost 11 months old and is probably too big to really bathe in this tub anymore; however I continue to use it because it's just so easy to pop it on top of the kitchen sink and fill it up. He sits up in it now and splashes and enjoys bath-time. We bought several other bath tubs and this one won out, hands down.
This is a great tub!  I especially like the comfy sling for newborns.
This is a required item to safely bathe your baby....ask the many parents who tragically tried to bathe Junior in the tub or the sink, only to have a soapy baby slip out of their hands and hit its head or worse. Fits over standard sinks or can be placed in the bathtub for easy use. Also light and easy to carry for trips. I camp a lot and this is ideal for bathing the small ones.
The infant mesh hammock is great for our baby girl. The size is also good. It is bulky to store, but she'll only be using it for a relatively short period of time, so it's a non issue. I really like this tub and highly recommend it.
One minor complaint--the little section for rinse water is MUCH too small.  I think it barely holds 2 cups of water!  I don't use it--I just put a big pitcher of water to the side of the tub and pour it over the baby's body in order to rinse him well.
This is a nice baby tub.  It does not fit in any of our sinks, so we have to use it in our bathtub, but we are ok with that. The sling works well to keep the little ones up out of the water, but you have to be careful of them sliding down towards the feet - if you have the water level up high enough, baby's mouth can slip under water.  We also don't like the fact that there is no way to hang it up. It would be nice if there was just somewhere you could hook onto a hook to hang it up so it could dry, but be out of the way.
The sling has a comfortable padding and is very easy to setup and adjust. Price is cheap and the productnhas good quality.
Like others have said, it's the best and only tub you'll need! My daughter is almost 11 months and we still use this tub daily! She's used it since we brought her home from the hospital. I love this tub. It worked in my kitchen sink, and now I just use it in the big tub. Love it!
I got this tub as a shower gift and it is by far one of the best gifts that I received.  Our baby loves to lay in the hammock part of the tub for her baths (she is only 7 weeks old).  She looks very comfortable and doesn't squirm around at all.  I have had no problems with it leaking (like other tubs that I have heard about) and it fits great in our double sink (that is probably 30 years old).  I definately recommend this tub for anyone with a newborn.  I just hope that she still likes it when I don't use the hammock.  I'm sure she will thought!
Absolutely not comfortable. My baby always slips out of it to a different sides, especially legs. She constantly slips down. So, we are forced to hold her while washing. Kind a stupid look of the washing process. Need to do it super fast, not enjoying the process. I do not understand why it has a septum on the middle - it is soooo annoying. Wish to return but too late. Also, I am very sure it is too small for toddlers.
I love this product! It fits our kitchen sink perfectly. the mesh sling is perfect for our newborn. It's soft and provides a nice seat. My baby loves sitting in it and becomes very calm and happy at bath time. I like that there's a little slot at the bottom for a wash rag. It's very convenient for when you need to set it down to adjust the baby. It's inclined in such a way so that you can't put too much water in there and accidentally submerge your baby when he's sitting in the sling.
My dd is now 5 months old and we are still using this tub.  I wasn't sure I would get a baby tub b/c a friend said she only used hers twice.  Well, I'm glad I did!  I selected this one after reading online reviews.  It fits nicely in our kitchen sink which puts it at a good heighth to avoid back strain.  It is nice sturdy plastic with no leaking (as fold up ones do), and no mildew on pads.  The infant side has a little curve to it, so if baby splashes the water just rolls to the other side of tub, not out.  The drain is very nice to have in the bottom, plus it turns white if water is too hot.  The sling was great for sponge baths in the beginning, it really cradles baby so YOU feel better.  I haven't used the toddler side yet b/c she can sit up, but I think she may outgrow it before I can do that anyway.
I purchased this tub after reading all the online reviews of all the other tubs.  I am happy with the purchase.  Up until my daughter was 2 months old, I used the infant insert that comes with the tub to hold her.  She didn't like it very much and acted as if she felt like she was going to fall or something.  I finally just removed it and I use the toddler tub itself.  She likes that much better.  She is 2 1/2 months now, and she fits just fine in the tub.  Bath time is still a trying time for us, but at least I knwo that she is safe in the tub.  It has a plug on the right had side to help it drain.  If you rely on that, it will take forever to drain.  I just turn it upside down and empty it out.
I bought this tub here on Amazon as I found it SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than at Babies R Us. I think I paid something like $15 or $20 for it. So far, we have used this tub for our newborn on several occasions and it's been great. I like that there's a little valve on the bottom so you can empty out the water and I like the sling- it's great for infant sponge-baths. This tub fits beautifully in our kitchen sink- it's a large sink but I think pretty average sized for a kitchen. I also like that there is a little space at one end of the tub where I put the shampoo and body soap.
The other common baby bath tub, the Eurobath, was too big, but this one might be a bit too small. (I have no idea how this could ever be considered a toddler tub, my son seemed too big for it when he was less than a year old.)I do like this tub for use with babies, though. I liked the little trough for rinsewater; the foam padding that help keeps your baby from sliding; and the lightweight construction. If you plan to bathe your baby in your own bathtub (meaning you'll have to move the baby bath out each time you shower), definitely get this one since it's smaller than other models and easy to move around.
The infant Sling with is is wonderful and does well to hold them up when sitting in when they are a bit bigger. Sits sturdy on the sink. And easy to clean.
This was the second infant tub I tried and it's a winner!  The sling is excellent for newborns, no worries about having to hold the baby up while washing.  I put my daughter in the sling at 1 month (as soon as her umbillical cord fell off) and transitioned her into the tub at around 3 months once she had some better neck and head control.  Now she's 5 months and is still using the slanted back 'newborn' side, but it works for her.  There is plenty of support near her bottom to hold her up and keep her from sliding into the tub, but there is still plenty of legroom for her to kick and play.  Thanks to this tub she loves bathtime and it's a wonderful part of our evening 'going to bed' process!
Great for newborns and toddlers. Love it.  You won't be sorry if you buy it.  6 of my girlfriends bought the same one and they all love it, too.  It's all one piece, so no leaking. The hammock is great for newborns.  It's a good depth, and good price.
The feature that I loved the most was the baby hammock. Perfect when they're newborn. Instead of bending over, trying to hold them with the crook of your arm, plop them in the hammock and they get to relax and enjoy the warm water. Once they're a little bigger you can do away with the hammock and they get to submerge a little more in the water while still sitting up. My baby loves every minute of his bath.
We received this tub as a gift when our daughter was just a week old. We didn't use it until after her umbilical cord had fallen off, and she always had excellent head control, so we never used the cradle part of it.I had been concerned because our kitchen sink is awkward, but the tub fit right in with no problems. The supports underneath are rather ingenious, and both double and single sinks. We didn't even have to take out the in-sink dish drainer that is one side of our double sink!The green grip material on the infant side of the tub does a great job. My daughter had a tendency to tip to the side at first, but she never slipped up or down. The seating ridge at the bottom is also well placed...it gave her something to brace her bottom against and kick her feet in the water.The colour-change plug was very handy, especially at first when we were getting the hang of what is too warm for a baby. If it's too warm, it turns a light colour, very easy to see against the dark blue background.The drain plug was easy to pull out and to put in, but I did notice that it just doesn't drain all the way, mostly because of the way the bottom is designed. The only way to completely get all the water out is to turn it upside down.The tub was quite easy to clean as well, I was at first concerned about the grip material. For some reason, I'm very sensitive to the smell of mildew (not allergic, just seem to be able to pick up the smell earlier than a lot of people), and I was afraid that the grip material would be difficult to get dry and would mildew. But no fear -- just washed the whole thing down with dish soap each night and left it to air dry, and there was never a hint of mildew or mold.Once she could sit up with support, we tried her on the toddler side, but that didn't work very well. It would have been nice if the sloped infant side was adjustable -- she wanted to sit up, but needed more support than the completely vertical toddler seat. It was possible for her to sit on the infant side, but then she had no support behind her back and we had to keep our hands on her all the time.And once she started sitting without support, I found it was easier to just put her in the big tub. She's on the larger end of normal size (9 pounds at birth, 18 pounds at 5.5 months) and once she started wanting to play in the tub, the baby tub just wasn't big enough. There's no way there's enough room to put her and the bath toys she now wants in there either.I know First Years says it is an infant/toddler tub, but I honestly don't think that it would be a good tub for a toddler. That said, I know that some little kids are scared of the big tub, and this would be a great alternative in that case. Or if you don't have a tub and don't want to take your baby into the shower. For us, though, it really didn't work once she was able to sit up unsupported.All in all, if you want to use a baby tub, then this is an excellent choice. And if you get it as a gift, this is a great tub to have! But, barring the circumstances I mentioned above, it might be easier to just bathe baby in the sink when little, get in the tub with baby when a little older, and then just go straight to the big tub on his or her own.
this tub has been one of the best things I registered for.  for the first few months we used the hammock in the tub, and bathing my son was a breeze.  now the hammock has been removed and he is using the infant side of the tub (more of an incline than the toddler side).  I love the no skid pads to the seat - it keeps baby from squirming so much.  The other side of the tub has a straight backed seat for toddlers.Another feature to this tub (one that we haven't needed, but it's nice to know is there) is that the bottom of the tub has grooves for fitting the tub into a sink (single or double).  We just put the tub inside our big tub - my son's a splasher and we've found this is the best way to contain the tidal waves he creates.  But I love the idea that we could use this in a sink if needed.The only feature I haven't seen work is the drain plug is supposed to be one of those color changing things to prevent filling the tub with too hot water.  I've yet to see the thing change color.  But, we also have one of those rubber ducks that is supposed to do the same thing, and it changes color even in cool water.  I guess those things just aren't reliable.  Plus, the fact that this tub even has a drain plug is another great feature in my book!
I bought this for my daughter's new baby. She reports back to me that she likes it  and their baby loves his baths in it now that he is 5 months old.
This tub is awesome. The sling part perfectly cradles my newborn. She love love loves lying there in the warm water and I feel safe that her head is elevated out of being able to slip underwater (and of course I'm there the whole time). It also has a convenient drain in the bottom, so it's easy to get the water out.
I loved having this bath for my son's first year of life.  He could still use it now (11 months old) but he just likes being in the big tub =)  The sling was absolutely perfect for him because he was born 8 weeks early and had to be given special baths for the first few months of life.  It grew with him perfectly and helped him as he was learning to sit in the water and play with the water.  It is easy to clean and dump as it is really light.  I like the little tray area at the bottom because I was able to warm up his soap and lotion in some warmer water in that area.  I recommend this tub and am so thankful my friend bought it for me!
We are really happy with this tub. It fits perfectly in our sink which is round across the back and straight in the front. The infant hammock is a great feature and our son must think it's comfortable because he does NOT cry in it! The only thing is that he does slide down in the hammock and his feet don't stay in it too well, they fall off the side of the hammock and I have to put them back in for him (he's a little wiggly though!) Overall, this is a wonderful tub, especially for the price!
We have used this tub both with and without the hammock feature for our son. We have found that it works great both ways! We love the versatility. It is easy to carry (even with water in it) and empty. It fits on a variety of surfaces from our tub, countertops and kitchen sink. The plastic is easy to clean and the water stays warm for a long time. The handy compartment holds rinse water or supplies. It is easy to position our son and get him bathed quickly. Although it doesn't fold up, it stands easily and fits in our bathroom closet. Overall, you can't beat the product for the price!
Not a lot to say on this. It works as it should and is the right size. I would recommend.
I got this one as a gift. It's a simple design.  It's great!  It works for newborns, older infants and even toddlers.  It's easy to clean and the color change plug is easy to see and quickly tells you if baby's water is too hot. Not to mention it's awesome to be able to drain the water without lifting a tub full of water.  My sister has a fancier three in one tub for her son and it's a pain. This one os lightweight and fits in my kitchen sink and between my bathroom sinks.  It's true...simpler is better.  This is all you need!
We had been given a bath seat for a shower gift but when we used it we relized how cold the mesh got because the air was hitting it. It made for a very unhappy baby. We then decided to buy this tub because my little girl could be submerged in the water keeping her warm. We used the hammock at first (BE SURE NOT TO GET IT WET BEFORE PUTTING YOUR BABY IN IT BECAUSE IT GETS SUPER COLD)It was great because it supported her but her little bottom and back was in the warm water. At 2 months we took it out because she had head control and just layed her in the tub. It's great. It fits in the sink or you can use it in the tub. Your baby stays warm and it makes bath time a little more bearable. It will also last you a long time so you won't need another tub later when your little one is getting to big for an infant tub.
I have never bathed a newborn until I had my son.... and I must say, this tub made it so easy for me. The sling is the best part, and he is so comfortable in it. Make sure to washit  out clean after every use, as scum can pile up in the small grooves (which I eventually had to scrub out with a toothbrush). Nevertheless, I will recommend this.
I bought this tub after reading all the great reviews, and was very disappointed. The newborn mesh helped somewhat to keep the baby above the water, although she seemed quite uncomfortable in it. Now, that we use it as a toddler tub, it is a nightmare. The "hump" that is supposed to keep the child from sliding down, is useless. She slides down. And last night she leaned forward, fell out of the tub, and the tub toppled on top of her. Will not be using it again.
I received the tub in the specific time frame. Haven't been able to use it since baby isn't here yet but will revise my review if problems arise. Like the fact that it converts to toddler ages. But wish that it came in other gender neutral colors.
I have had friends who said they wished they had just gone with this tub in the beginning, rather than trying several and finally settling on this tub.  We were happy with it from day one.  We used it in the bedroom with the newborn hammock for the first couple of weeks.  We have used it in several different kitchen sinks, and it fits really well.  It is definitely a back-saver -- we tried using it inside the big bathtub, and we nearly broke our backs trying to bathe him that way.  We continued to use it once my baby could sit in the toddler side, around 4 or 5 months.  I've heard people say that their baby was "too big" for the tub, but my boy was always big and long for his age, and he never had any problems.  He was around 10 months old when we finally tried to find a bath seat for him to use in the big bathtub (see my other reviews), but we would gladly have continued to use the Sure Comfort.  The only real reason for switching is my son was getting way too active, and in our cramped kitchen we spent most of the bath prying our little monkey's hands off the faucet, etc., and hauling him back into the tub.  He was just ready for the big tub experience.
Bought this tub and use it in our larger bathtub.  Great sling for newborns.  Son loves laying in there with his feet and hands dangling in the water.
The sling in this bathtub works perfectly, it submerges our baby from the waist down. The size length and weight are perfect.  We are really happy with this bathtub :-)
My son is 7 months old and this tub has been excellent. LOVE the sling, it made even his first bath comfortable and safe. No longer use the sling and he still looks very comfortable in in. The grooves underneath keep the tub stable in a kitchen sink. Easy to use, easy to clean and you cant beat the price!
This tub has worked out great. The hammock feature was perfect for when baby was really little, we stopped using it when he was about four months. The tub fits over the kitchen sink, but we mainly use it in the bathtub. I like that it has a drain in the bottom so I don't have to tip it over to drain it.
This tub is great. We gave our newborn his first bath in this tub. I love the sling and don't have to worry about holding him all the time. He's safe in the net, not touching any hard corners of the plastic tub. He does occasionally slide down, but I can't complain. He loves taking baths.This tub fits perfectly in our sink. Any splashes will just go down our sink and not all over our countertops. At least for now, I can't predict how big his splashes will be when he's a toddler.
I used the heck out of this tub, until my son out grew it!  it was great and the best part was that it was recyclable!
Great tub for newborns. The net makes the shower process easier and my baby feels safe. Great size and fits on top of small counters. I would recommend this item.
My mother-in-law bought this bath for us to use when we were visiting and staying at her house.  Immediately after placing my daughter in it I wished I had gotten this bath instead of the one I had.  I didn't use this bath until my daughter had outgrown their bathroom sink, so I never used the hammock, but I attached it to see how it would work and I can see how perfect it would be.  I love that babies can lounge in it when they are younger, and then sit up straight at the other end of the tub as they grow.  The tub is very deep and roomy.  When I have another baby I will definitely be getting this tub for myself.
My husband and I love this tub for our baby.  The infant sling is very useful.  It is easy to empty out and wash as well.  We like the stopper that changes color if the water is too hot.  Overall, a great tub and I wouldn't use anything else!
A friend passed her tub on to me after I complained about my tub-- the First Years convertible tub/seat which is AWFUL! It's so shallow that there's barely enough water to get the baby's butt wet! this was much better and had two positions -- newborn and infant. Now my 6 month old can sit and splash and not freeze because he's in two inches of water. Wish this had a suction cup on the bottom to keep it from sliding on smooth, wet surfaces.
Love the concept of the sling. Also love that it has a spout - it makes it very easy to use.I did not realize that this would sit easily over the sink. Makes life really easy. Highly recommended product.
I have to agree with the others that said this tub is not very comfortable. I'm not sure what kind of baby fits well in this, but ours hasn't since the day he was born and he's 4 months now. We have been using the sling and it keeps most of his body out of the water, so he gets cold so we have to keep a washcloth over his body and keep pouring warm water over it just to keep him warm during his bath. This make bathtime a 2 person job.The hump that's supposed to keep them from sliding down when you're NOT using the sling is positioned directly in the middle of his back so it pokes at his back the entire time.Last week we figured he was finally big enough not to use the sling, but it was worse. He kept sliding down and we had to put it back on despite my complaints from above.I do not recommend this tub at all and am very disappointed. I don't know why it has such high reviews.
I borrowed a different tub from a friend when my daughter was born, and she hated bathtime with that tub.  The "hammock" feature on THIS tub is great.  Your baby lies in the hammock, and she can be more or less in the water, depending on how much water you put in the tub, and how you adjust the hammock.  When your child is old enough to sit up, you can remove the hammock, and there are 2 different seating positions.  I also love the fact that this fits in the kitchen sink.  It's much more comfortable than bending over the bathroom tub.
The net makes it really easy to hold the baby in.  I was going to go with a super expensive tub until I realized its just a piece of plastic.  You should stick with this and save some money
I love this tub for our little guy.  The sling is perfect for when baby's are small and it adjusts as they grow.  It is easy to clean out and it has a conveinent separate dish for clean rinsing water.
Received this as a shower gift and it is great.  It fits on the edges of our kitchen sink (not IN the sink) and the sling was fantastic until my daughter was about 2.5 months (she is long at 24&#34;); kept her from sliding down into the water too much.  Has a drain if you need it (so you don't have to pick up the tub when it's full of water) and has a little spot for soap bottles and a washcloth to keep them handy during bathtime.
This is a great tub.  The newborn sling feature is key!  We are still using the sling with our 12-lb 3-month-old.  It's nice because you can then use both hands to bathe the baby instead of having to hold him up.  The other great feature is that it is designed to fit over half of a double kitchen sink, so you can stand up while bathing the baby instead of kneeling over your bathtub.
This tub is great, and the sling is a helpful tool when your child is a newborn. But to consider it up to toddler years is a bit of a reach.My 4 month old is at the verge of sitting on his own, his legs are long enough to reach the end of the tub and likes to push at it, which normally isnt a problem except the ledge that the kids sit on after the sling is removed is not very deep and he slips off everytime. I have checked into sveral other tubs and there isnt one that is perfect, but this one does the job until the next stage begins.
This is a great tub - I can actually look away for a millisecond and my son is still OK. The hammock is awesome for a small baby - my 3 month son is very comfortable in it.
When I was looking for a bathtub, I wanted something nice and fancy... big mistake!! I tried 3 different bathtubs, expensive ones, I decided to give this one a try (besides, I didn't want to spend more money on bathtubs)  I'm glad I bought this one...What I like about this bathtub:*Size is perfect with enough space even for a big baby*Foam on back and seat*Perfect reclining angle*Back support for sitting babies*Water level reaches your baby's ribs with a small amount of water (I love to take care of my environment)*Compartment for bathing articles.
This is one WONDERFUL tub!! I love the newborn hammock for when you're waiting for the little cord to dry up. And it was great extra support for a slippery baby. My little girl was never paniced in this tub. We used it in the kitchen often when she was very little and then moved it into the tub when she started making a huge water mess!! :) The way you can sit them reclining (for when they are very small) on one side and then sit them up on the other side where it's flat is a great feature. My little girl is ten months old and she just loves to splash her little heart out! This was a great gift!! I recommend to all. :)
My 6 week old loves her tub time! The thing that first attracted me to this particular tub was the infant cradle/sling.  It is a machine washable netting complete with headrest that extends the length of the tub.  It is great for those beginning sponge baths and continues to be useful as your little one learns to completely control their head and neck.  No more bathing with one hand as you try to keep the baby upright with the other hand. This tub also has an added safety feature, a drain that begins to turn white as the water gets hotter.  This makes it so much easier to gage wether the temperature is too hot for your precious baby.  There is also a spot on the front of the tub where you can sit baby bath, washcloths, etc.  I am so happy with our decision. This is a wonderful tub and I would recommend it to anyone.
This bathtub is great! My 3 month old loves the water, and seems to feel very secure in the mesh cradle included. The tub fits perfectly in my kitchen sink, and has a little compartment to hold soap etc.Edited to say: At almost 8 months we are still using this bathtub! We moved it from the sink into the tub quite a while ago, and took the mesh cradle out. He is almost too big for it now, and we'll be looking at those bath seats.  However, there are not that many baby items that you can say you got almost 8 months use from - so I'm very satisfied.Great purchase - highly recommended!!
Great tub, perfect size for my newborn with plenty of room to grow. No complaints here.  Amazon has the best prices and fast delivery
This tub is very sturdy.  It is contoured well and makes bathtime easy.  The infant sling is a very necessary attachment.
My baby gets scared very easily when she doesn't feel secure and will flare her arms and cry.  I wanted to make bath time was as stress free as possible, so I decided to purchase this tub because it has the hammock that can hold her and make her feel secure.  It is great!  Bath time is SO much easier now and she has learned to enjoy it.  I very much recommend this tub because it is something your newborn will grow into.
This is the perfect baby bath tub for an infant. We started using it as soon as my son's umbilical cord fell off and we could submerge his lower half in the water. He loves the water. We used the sling attachment until he was large enough to sit in the reclining side. He loves to splash, but you have to never take your eye off of them, but it's perfect to just sit in the bathtub for easy draining and splashing! He's 5 months now and still loving this tub!
Great tub. I wish it had a temperature strip on it though. I love the infant sling that comes with it!
This tub is perfect especially for a first time mother. I was very nervous about bathing my newborn but he snuggled right in without any discomfort. He is now a month old and looooooooves bath time.
Buy this one! It is the best! I tried 2 other tubs before I got this one. And it is awesome. Comfortable for mother and baby. It goes on your sink, so you don't have to bend down to bathe your baby. The sling feature is wonderful for when your little one is still a little one. But you can still use the tub without the sling when they get bigger. I used mine up to when my son was 10 months. I can't be more passionate about this tub. Buy this one!
A quick qualifier, I have never used this product.  However my wife uses this to bathe our grandson ll the time.  They both seem to love it.  It is a very well made, solid feeling tub.  I am sure it will stand up to many years of use.  With two more grandkids on the way - it better.  Great product and excellent value.
Compared to the other inclined/padded tubs that I tried, this one actually gets baby wet and lets her splash a little too. Although I got this after my baby's &quot;sling&quot; baths were over, I like the versatility. Sling for newborns, incline for non-sitters, and seat for sitters. It fits my double sink well, where the sprayer makes a great mini shower head to easily rinse baby. It don't won't hold a baby that is old enough to &quot;toddle&quot; but my 9 month old (albeit a preemie) still fits and will for a while more I suppose. By then it will be time for big tub baths w/ more toys anyway.
Purchased this because a friend had it and because it had received great reviews on Amazon (over the other bathtubs that I was considering).  Liked the sling and my baby finally outgrew it this week at 11.5 weeks.  So, now she's sitting in the reclined seat... works like a charm as I don't even have to hold her up.  The reclined seat worked even better than the sling (as she would usually slowly slide down the sling and I often had to re-adjust her).  The drain also drains pretty fast.  My husband even drilled a hole into the top of the tub so that we could hang it in our garage to drip dry (and for storage, of course).Works like it should except for one thing.  The product description stated that the drain would indicate if the water was too hot for the baby.  As stated on Amazon: "Drain plug alerts parents if water is too hot".However, no where on the packaging did it state this and the plug does not change color.  Being a first time parent... this would have been helpful... but in the end, it doesn't really matter as I discovered my baby prefers the water to be on the hotter side.  Strange but true!
This is an excellent tub for an infant.  PROS: the little sling that attaches to it is perfect for the sponge baths you will need to give your newborn while his/her belly button stub is still attached.  I filled the tub with just enough warm water so that when I placed the sling over it, my baby's bottom would be submerged (to keep him warm). After he was able to get full baths, the rubber padding on the "newborn" side helped keep him from sliding down or to the side.  CONS:  The "Infant-Toddler" seat on the opposite side is a little awkward.  My baby out-grew the bathtub at four months (and he is a little baby- in the 40th percentile). I seriously doubt that any toddler can fit in it.
I bought this tub when my newborn was 1 month (approx 10 lbs and 21 in). Loved it. The infant swing worked great and made bathtime quick and easy. I just popped it right in the kitchen sink and it worked well. At 3 months I removed the infant swing (approx 14 lbs and 24in) and moved to toddler tub. It still worked great. I folded the infant swing in half and used the padded head part for extra padding which worked well for adding additional comfort. My child is now 6 mo (approx 20lbs and 29in) and he has learned how to kick his feet and splash (which soaks mom and the kitchen floor, he learned this at about 5 mos). I have moved it to bath tub and that seems to work a little better but it doesn't leave a lot of room form him to play with toys (which he is just starting to get into). He is also sitting up (not steadily on his own yet, still falls to the side) and has outgrown this tub.That being said there are some cons. Like other people have mentioned the tub does not completely drain when you open the flap, you have to tilt it to get all the water out. When put in our sink (we have a split sink so we hook the legs under the head over one part and the cliff under the feet fits nicely on the other ledge) it leans forward a little so child is not leaning back but more vertical, he didn't mind it but I had to keep his head from pitching his whole body forward. There is also a bump that is meant to keep baby from slipping but it is awkwardly placed and uncomfortable when they start trying to sit on their own or when you try to lean them back to wash the head (jams into the infants back).Final thoughts: Love this tub for infants, not so much for toddlers. Currently looking for an new tub for my 6 month old. I would say 27 inches and 18 lbs and child not yet trying to sit up on their own would be best candidate for this tub. If any of the previous describe where you are at, look for a different tub.
This is a nice bath for the money. It fits well in my regular sized sink, which is separated into two sides.  Baby loves splashing around in it and the plug makes it so I don't have to try to empty it when it's full which is great. I also love that it grows with the baby. Great buy.
It's a little cumbersome and bulky and takes up a lot of bathroom floor space.  It is well made and sturdy.  I like being able to sit her in the sling and lean her forward on my arm, supporting her head, so I can wash her tushie and back.
Unfortunately this was one of the items we &#34;just purchased&#34; without doing much research.  My wife and I figured a infant tub is an infant tub right?  Well, not exactly.  The sling was easy to install and seems to serve its function just fine.  The baby is suspended and with the right adjustment gets the baby in the water, but keeps the head out of the water.  However, our baby is only a little over a month old and I can already tell after we remove the swing the tub will be difficult to use because of the shape of the plastic.More importantly we purchased this for the &#34;temperature sensitive&#34; plug.  When we went to give our baby his first bath I turned on the water to the hottest temperature and let it run on the plug for over 10 minutes.  The plug never changed color and the water was hot enough I wouldn't have felt comfortable bathing in it much less put a baby in it.  We had to purchase another temperature sensor to feel comfortable bathing our baby.  Considering they list this as a feature and it clearly doesn't work I can't recommend this product to anyone.
We bought this for our newborn, not having ANY previous baby experience, this bath tub was great. It fit over our double sink, but also on the counter. The sling is perfect to support the baby and it has a little shelve for the soap. My only issues, very minor, is you have to tip the tub over to drain out all the water, it won't all drain through the plug on the bottom.
My daughter is 9 months old and we are still using this tub!The sling was just perfect for sponge baths while my daughter had her umbilical cord attached. I'm reading that other reviewers are complaining that the sling gets too cold because it isn't directly in the water. Hello? This is for sponge baths!!! The sling is very secure and easy to set up.Once the cord fell off we began bathing her in the tub on the "infant side". It is perfect. I can bathe her one-handed - she doesn't slip down at all. The pads are mold-resistant too.The water does not leak out of the plug and the tub fits easily into our double sink. Our daughter loves her baths. The water level is perfect, she doesn't get cold and she can kick and splash the water to her heart's content.I agree that the "toddler side" is too awkward to bathe baby sitting straight up but we just keep our daughter on the infant side and she sits up on her own.I can't say enough about this tub.  We've used it longer than any of the other things we've bought for the baby.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  It is well worth every penny you spend on it for  worry-free bathing.
We used this tub for our newborn, until he was old enough start pulling himself up to standing, around 8 months old.  At that point, we ditched the infant tub and put him in the regular tub with some toys.We liked this infant tub because it fit nicely in the big tub OR on top of the kitchen sink.  The newborn sling was only useful for those first few baths, until the umbilical cord fell off.I don't think I'd use this for an older infant or a toddler, as it's easy for them to stand up in it because of the sloped bottom, which puts their feet below the level of their butt, and they could lose their balance or tip over the tub.  (Obviously supervision is always a must during baths.)
I had got tin this as a gift for my daughter I am not fascinated with the sling it's way to skinny her legs keep ending up over the sides and my daughter is always slipping down in it other then that I haven't used the tub itself yet I do like that u can put ur soap and stuff in the holder it has
This is an EXCELLENT bath tub for my 3 week old. We put in the Safer Bather and fill the tub with our detachable shower head and bath time is soooo simple....Just remember to cork the plug at the bottom of the tub...SO for you mom's looking for a tub for your infant this is the one, just don't forget to buy the safer bather to go along with it..this will keep you from having to hold the baby while bathing her, just lean her back into the cushion and wash with BOTH HANDS!!!!Note: I didn't buy this tub to fit into my kitchen sink...Use it as a mini bath tub that can fit on a diningroom table, in your regular sized tub or on the floor...since I only have a stand up shower I put it on the floor of the shower and use my detachable shower head...It works GREAT!!!!
We almost went out and bought a plastic container from a container store but thought it might be just as expensive/costly to buy a legitimate child's wash basin.  Turns out we were right!  This thing is really nice.  The mesh piece that you can attach (for toddlers) is great.  It's not harsh on the skin or anything.Also, there is a little drain plug you can use in case you have a hard time positioning the wash basin in such a way to empty the water in it for fear of getting water all over the place.
I agree with many of the other reviews ... there is no need for a pricey bathtub, this one works fantastic!  The 3 stages of this tub (newborn, infant and toddler) will make it a useful item for a long time.  The sling feature is perfect for newborns.  The non skid pads in the infant side are a great feature, and the high angled back is very supportive.  The tub is a great size -- not too large to store and fits in most standard sinks (I have a 1 1/2 size sink).  We've moved into the upstairs bathtub, and I just place this inside the tub while our little guy kicks and splashes.  At 26 inches he still fits nicely in the infant side -- we have not yet moved to the deeper seated end for toddlers yet.  We may just move to a tub seat when he can sit well enough.  This is a great tub and a great value for the price.
I'm very pleased with this product.Pro's1.  I love how this tub is designed to grow with the baby- unlike so many other products. The sling is definitely a nice feature, even if you only use it for a couple of weeks. The infant side was clearly very comfortable for our little one and set him at a great angle for me to wash him. I was worried that the tub would feel small once he was using the "sitting up" side but he still has quite a bit of room now at 7 months and 20 pounds.2.  The small basin is handy- I use it for washcloths, but also great as a clean water spot.3.  Tub worked well on our countertop.  Now that baby is bigger, I use it in our single kitchen sink.  Fits great and puts the tub at a very comfortable height for me.4.  Tub appears to be truly mildew-resistant.Con'sNone really- the tub is a bit bulky if you're in a small apartment, but I can't imagine a baby tub any smaller being very useful.I'd highly recommend this tub.
I have been using this tub with my boy since he was about 2 months old (and had grown out of the Puj). The design of this tub is perfect - my son is now 8 months old (and almost 23lbs, 30+ inches in height), and sits comfortably while playing in the water. When I need to wash his hair, I make him recline on the other side (with the recline) - washing his hair this way helps keep the water/ soap out of his face. I had attempted to use this with the hammock when he was younger, but somehow I couldn't figure out how to use it - for example, I didn't know how to clean his back while he lay on his back. Also, the clips came off a couple of times while I was scrubbing him, and that scared me, so I stuck with the Puj till he grew out of it. However, my friend has a baby now and is comfortably using this same tub with the hammock for her new born, so it may have been an issue only for me. Highly recommend it. It's also much cheaper than some of the other tubs, and better designed. The little humps in the base help keep the baby's butt from sliding when they sit reclined, if you know what I mean. I suspect when you use the hammock, at some point the baby's butt may start hitting against these. Overall, great tub.
It has been a couple of months that I have used the tub. I used the sling for a day or two, it was not very comfortable using the sling. Baby ended up slouching on the sling and hard to move around.  Without the sling, bath time was a two man's job since one person had to support the baby's body and head while the other person bathed the baby. Now that the baby is older and is able to control her head, it has been a lot more easier using the tub.
My son is just about 8 months old now and I figured I would jump online and start reviewing some of the products I have used. When I was pregnant, I found the reviews helpful, so I thought I would add to the feedback....No need to go crazy and buy a more pricey version of a tub. This one fit perfectly in my sink and was very easy to bathe the baby. As an infant, he used the hammock and then grew out of that, into the base tub and now has grown from there into the real bath now. While I used the tub it was wonderful. Was very pleased and satisfied with this product. I received it as a gift and found it to work just fine.
We love this tub!  When my daughter (5 months old) sees it, she gets a big smile on her face!  She has loved taking a bath from the beginning.  I love it because it is so easy to use and clean.  And... when she is splashing and kicking, the water usually stays in the tub.  There is a groove around the back of her head that allows the water to go from side to side (if it doesn't make sense, take my word for it) withoug flying out.  Water still gets on the floor in the kitchen, but not nearly as much as it could.  The sling was great for when she was small.I would highly recommend this bath tub!!!
This is an excellent tub. The hammock is a life-saver. Our little girl just loves to take a bath in this. The water reserve is great for "clean" water - to use as rinse water when soap or other "liquids" end up in the main section.
Put simply, this tub was easy to clean, sturdy and safe (we used the included sling for about 3-4 months). My average-sized daughter used it up to age 17 months, although she probably would have liked to be in he Big Tub sooner.My only complaint is that the legs are open to the tub, like a cup. This allowed water (and more) to collect in the legs, even when the tub was turned upside down to drain and even though the legs have pinpoint drain holes. This would be easily solved by the manufacturer by making the legs solid. Otherwise, no complaints.
I absolutely love this tub.  It was a shower gift, and 15 months later I am still using it for bath time.  It worked great with the "newborn sling" for the early months, then later without the sling for the sitting-up era.  It even works now for the climbing era, staying in place when the little guy moves around.  It's sturdy, good-looking, practical and reasonably priced.  I notice other reviewers have commented on the temperature feature not working, but in my tub if the water is too hot the indicator on the tub turns white as it should.  However, I don't rely on the indicator anyway but use my judgment regarding water temp.I really like the non-slippery, padded surfaces inside the tub.  But for me the best feature is the fact it truly works as a newborn tub with the sling, and later as a toddler tub on its own.  Sturdy, practical, comfortable - just add water, bubble bath and rubber duckies and you're all set!
Deep crevices make it hard to clean. Gunk settles in there and even a tooth brush can't fit in to clean it. Gross.
We love this tub!  We got it with the sling to be safe, but never needed it.  Our son was 9 lbs and was able to sit in the newborn side of the tub from his first bath.  The pads are great, we have not had any molding problems and there's a nifty slot at the top of the tub that can hold washcloths, etc.  The tub has held up well and is a good product.
We found this to be useless...not because it's a bad product but rather why waste the money when a bath sponge will do. My baby loves to bathe and lays very calmly in the bath. But she gets cold easily so we bought a big bath sponge instead. We lay her on it and she stays much warmer. The best part is that the sponge is less than $4 and you can use it anywhere- the kitchen sink, tub, etc.
I love the harness that comes with the tub.. it is so helpful with tiny little ones.  Then as baby gets bigger you can loosen the straps and still use it or take it off altogether.  My son is 4 months old and we still use the harness for washing but once we are done with that I unsnap it and he gets to play in the &#34;deep end&#34; and loves it.
I had a blue one of these for my first few kids years ago. Just bought this one to replace it for my daughter who will be born soon. It's the same one...different color. I didn't care to try the pricey ones with all kinds of features. This one worked just fine and I was happy with it. I'm sure I will be again. One side is perfect for babies, the other for toddlers. Easy to keep clean. Cheap and works great. Couldn't ask for more from a baby tub.
The newborn sling is a great feature... my newborn feels safe and secure and enjoys bath time. Without it... he gets very nervous.. love it.
I really like this tub!  The sling is great for newborns. I just figured out yesterday that I can use it with my kitchen sink too(easy to rinse her with the sprayer).  She is four months and almost too tall for the infant part. I sit her up in the toddler part to wash her hair and then recline her back on the newborn side for the rest of her bath.
We have been using this tub for our daughter since she was born. We used the mesh sling with her as a newborn then removed it and used the tub on both ends while she was an infant and now as a toddler (11 months). She is getting a bit big and displaces most of the water in it now so we probably will have to go to the big tub soon but it saves so much water to bathe her in this :)
This tub has worked great for my son since he was a newborn.  We're still using it 5 months later.  Your baby can grow with this tub.  The way the tub contours with the baby's body is great.  I never felt my baby can slip or be harmed by the tub (of course, I never leave my sight from him when he's in the tub).  I've used another tub while visiting in-laws and didn't like it as much.  So far, this is the best tub for us.
This tub is the best tub I've owned for bathing my newborn. The sling was perfect, and then my son quickly grew and we had him sitting on the slant side. After a couple weeks sitting on the slant side, he learned to splash. Once he began splashing, he would slide down, and the hump wasn't keeping him in place. The way I fixed that is by reducing the water in the tub. My son is just now 10 weeks. I read another review that stated that at 4 1/2 months the reviewer began experiencing the same thing. My son is very tall, so I am sad that this tub didn't last us as long. We still use it, but we are unable to sit my son up on the other side because he is still very young and not sitting up on his own, not even close. Because my son is tall, he kicks the back part of the tub already, so I don't think this tub will last us as long as I was hoping, but if my son weren't so tall, I'd have given this five stars. Maybe the manufacturers could make a tub for tall babies?
This is a great bath for newborns but once baby's feet reaches the other end, baby tries to turn over and it's a trouble. We had to buy other type of bath (looks like whale). I really liked this bath and it worked great but I wish I had bought the other one in the beginning.
We received one of these and two of the Munchkin (3 compartment dispensers). Both my husband and I HATE this one so much that we actually avoid using it. When we are holding our baby and trying to shake the formula out into a bottle, it often ends up spilling onto the counter because of the flat lid. The opening on our Munchkin dispensers has a slightly funnel shaped lid that lets the formula slide out with minimal tapping. ONE STAR for the fact that it has 4 compartments instead of 3. The Sassy dispenser would have been a waste of money, had we purchased it ourselves. Get the Munchkin dispenser instead.
I ordered this and got pink both times...I have little boys and still used the pink anyway! :) Every mom should own this! Great for diaper bags and can also be used later for small snacks like cheerios or the yogurt bites! Ideal for night time so you don't have to fumble around warming up bottles...put hot water in the bottle, measure out the formula, and by time baby wakes up water is warm and ready to make!
Love the divided compartments. Love that you can store enough formula for an entire day's use in such a small container. Very, Very practical. I plan on using it later for dispensing cherrios and other snacks.
These are great to take along so that you don't have to carry a whole can of formula or try to pour premeasured formula out of a baggie or tupperware.  The chambers do mix a little at times but only when the lid isn't on tighly so make sure it snaps in place.  All in all it's a great item.
Although this item is not perfect -- there can be some shifting between compartments -- overall it's a very convenient way of packing baby formula into the diaper bag!
Just had a baby five days ago, and the first two days he breastfed beautifully, even though I have an inversion problem.  I was so proud.  Imagine my dismay when my little champion suddenly stopped being able to latch on once my milk started coming in more fully and I swelled up like a balloon.  After a frustrating 24 hours and trying every trick in the book, I decided to break down and buy one of these.  What a godsend!  He latched on right away.  I've read my supply might get low so I've started pumping three times a day between feedings just to be sure (saving the extra milk for those nighttime feedings that daddy can help with).  Hopefully we'll be able to wean off the shields eventually, but for now they're keeping us on the breast and from having to pump 8-12 times a day, so I'm relieved!Update: Should've consulted a lactation consultant, apparently this was totally the wrong size (I guess this is the size they use for preemies in the NICU) and may have contributed to a low milk supply problem (though apparently I also have a nodule on my thyroid which may have caused that problem).  However, once I bought the right size (27 mm) it was still a godsend, it was my fault and not the company's.  I urge you to contact an LC before using, but it's still a great product!  And once we decided to stop using it, it only took a few days to completely wean him off the shield with the LC's help!
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067PPZ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleDon't know that I could nurse without these. I was engorged because my daughter was frustrated with nursing so she had stopped nursing for a day or two as we tried formula. I was blistered and doubled over in pain. My pediatrician recommended these and raw cabbage leaves for the engorgement. The cabbage leaves were worn under my night bra over night on all parts of my breasts including the nipples and by morning they were 100% healed. The nipple shields got my baby back to nursing keep my baby nursing. Since these nipple shields make your nipples more pronounced and they leave extra milk that sits in them to keep them from drying up. The BEST invention ever!!!
Was given this at hospital due to latch difficulties My daughter mouth is tiny and she could not get proper suction. We've been using the shield since until she is able to nurse without it. I like that she gets skin contact with this shield and it's probably closest thing to a real nipple.
I had twins born almost a month prematurely.. one was a great nurser, and the other not so much. After needing to supplement both with formula to gain weight, they both developed thrush and neither would nurse.. they'd try but wouldn't latch. I first bought two sizes too large, and ended up getting this 16mm shield -which fits much better for my babies and myself. Both took to the nipple shield right away, even with the thrush (my pediatrician said nursing could be painful for them when they have it), and I was able to nurse using this little silicone godsend.. Not only that, but after using it only 4-6x each, both babies are now nursing without it. Still not latching as good as they should be, but they're definitely getting milk.Only problem is that when the babies are really hungry they move around so much that the suction is broken and the milk pooled up inside of it spills out, making feedings very messy. I learned to keep a burp cloth tucked up under my breast to prevent a wardrobe change after every feeding and while it still leaks, it isn't as annoying to use. I soon started feeding with a bottle until the baby calmed down enough to use the nipple shield- which worked for the most part.Also wish it came with a case.. everything likes to stick to it and therefore needs constant washing/sterilizing.. and while I like that it looks more natural for the babies in being transparent, it is hard to find sometimes.. and I've not lost mine now twice and feel that a case would greatly help both problems..Overall, I did find this nipple shield very helpful and it is what got my babies to nurse again after 2 months of straight bottle feedings. I was very impressed with it and would recommend it (even after needing to buy 3 to get the correct size- go by the nipple size, not the areola!). Still, I wish it would have stayed on better. If I had to order it again or if my babies develop nursing problems again, I would buy a brightly colored pacifier case specifically to house it.
We've had latching issues and this was our saving grace for breast feeding. However, it's annoying that it doesn't always stay on so well (she can easily knock it off) at first. The flaps keep pulling up. I wish there were a way for it to stick to the skin better.
Was a life saver for the first few weeks when my son couldn't latch on properly. I would seriously pay $100 for this shield when I needed it. I bought a couple of them so that I didn't have a panic attack every time I couldn't find one
search on youtube on videos of how to put it on... did everything but it did NOT stayed on... maybe it's just me.,. it didn't work for me.. but didn't work for my baby either... he didn't seem to like it ... i ended up pumping instead with the chap nipple.. laniosh creme works best.. and it's okay for baby to nurse with the creme on..
It's useful and helpful. It's one of the best inventions for nursing moms, I think. It would have been better if the contact surface were a little wider so that it can stay attached better.
My babies had trouble latching for whatever reason.  I tried all kinds of advice.  I didn't like the idea of nipple shields.  Pasties with a respectable purpose?  Ewww!  As a last resort, I finally tried them and never again had a problem getting the babies to latch.  I tried 3 different sizes.  The 16mm fits easiest in the babies' mouths but makes it easiest for them to bite down.  The 24mm seemed too big for their mouths or to stay in place.  So, the 20mm was just right for us but all three of them worked.  I like this design so that their noses touch my bare skin.  I tried one where it was a solid circle so their noses touched silicone and it seemed just a little harder for them to breath easy.  The package contains just one shield which is enough unless you have twins and need two to tandem feed.  They are very easy to clean.
I wish I had tried this the first time. It cuts the pain on half! I appreciate that it also helps slow the flow when the let down comes too quickly.
A few days after starting to nurse, I wound up engorged (likely due to a poor latch) and baby girl had an even harder time latching.  I remembered reading about using these to remedy the issue.  I made an extremely quick trip to the store (do not wait for these to be shipped!).  After a few nursing sessions, the engorgement eased and baby girl figured out the latch issue.  These are a great tool, but I can't imagine using them on a regular basis.
I love these silly things! They made nursing work with my heavy milk let down. I could kill all the lactation consultants who warn that your milk supply will dwindle with these--that warning only applies to the OLD shields that were made of thick rubber. I have a strong let down that was gagging both my kids at birth and these shields made it so they could regulate the flow a bit better. Although I tried to wean my first daughter off the shield because all the consultants made me feel terrible for using them, she would only nurse with it, so we used it exclusively for 18 months! I never had any cracking, thrush, or any nipple issues either, and I think these shields really helped with that!Now that I have a second baby, I was having terrible pain when she was nursing. I had every consultant in the hospital give me different advice telling me I was holding her wrong, I was sitting wrong, she will grow out of her strong latch, my nipples will toughen up, and meanwhile, I was crying with every feeding and had bruises on both nipples. At 5 days old, my husband saw me clenching my teeth and curling my toes as I latched our baby on my now-bruised boob and he said &#34;remember those witch's hat thingies you used before? I'm going out and getting you some! You never cried like this with our first!&#34; And he was right! He got one and nursing has been easy and comfortable ever since, for 5 months now. I plan on using it until she weans, hopefully at 12-18 months like our first. I have a huge milk supply, never had any troubles with supply or latch because of these. I wish consultants would get better-informed and stop making new mamas feel like crap for using these.
I would not have been able to breast feed if it were not for this nipple shield so I have nothing but good things to say about this product. It is durable and easy to clean and use.
We took a breastfeeding class and the teacher never mentioned this.  I had the hardest time when my son was born with latching on.  It hurt so much and it would take 45 mins to get him latched on.  I would recommend this to everyone.  I wish I would have known about it before.  Would have saved me 3 days of tears.
My nipples were in so much pain and the baby's latch was bad. These nipple shields allowed me to continue breastfeeding. I am still using them after 3 months and my supply is very plentiful, and baby is growing very well. I tried weaning a few times but baby prefers the shield. I will keep trying to wean due to the convenience (don't have to bring the shield when going out), but other than the convenience factor, I don't mind it.
I was very close to giving up on breastfeeding after strictly pumping and bottle feeding for over 6 weeks, then I thought Id give this a try, immediately my son latched to it and nursed like a pro! My milk supply is fine! My son is now 10 weeks old and still going strong, this shield is meant for temp. use but I am still using it for a few reasons.... my son still cant quite get a good latch on his own to my nipple without this, and it prevents nipple soreness, which all in all makes breastfeeding the best expierience in the world! I highly recommend this product to every mother I know!
My baby had such a hard time latching on. He was term, but had preemie tendencies in his latch. The first couple of days we were home I was losing my mind and crying all night because he wouldn't take to the breast and I couldn't figure out why. I bought a nipple shield just to see if it would help and it did for a couple of feedings but that was it. I finally was able to meet with a lactation consultant who showed us how to use the shield properly (we were doing okay, but I wasn't holding it quite right) and when my baby was 9 days old we were finally EBFing. I am trying to wean him off, but he is getting plenty to eat and his weight gain is right on target. He isn't too gassy, either. In fact, I don't always burp him because he just doesn't burp very often. I highly recommend the shield though, it saved my sanity.
It really helps easy the pain! Before I use it, I really need encourage myself a lot before breast feeding.
I have a particularly small child.  She was 6 lbs at birth but completely healthy.  I purchased this item in hopes to get some relief for my sore nipples.  The product is bigger than a bottle nipple.  It's to wide and sticks out to far.  It gagged her so she would not use it.  I'm sure it probably works for some people but I had a Medela Nipple shield with my first child that covered all of the areola and was a better fit.  This one is bulky.  I may have ordered the wrong size so I would say contact a lactation consultant or your hospital's doula for help.  The one I used that worked (4 years ago) was given to me in the hospital.  I had to order this one online since we are military and stationed overseas.  I did like that the baby gets more skin to skin contact with this item...so if your child isn't a petite little one...they may like it.
no one wants to use a nipple shield, but these work and are just as advertised. would recommend buying it if needed
There is nothing wrong with the nipple shield, and it arrived in good time and good condition. However, I realized when I opened it that it wasn't what I need. This isn't the fault of the product or the seller, but my own inexperience, and I thought I would leave a review to give a little bit of advice based on what I found out after I bought it.I had to use a nipple shield with my first child because, like many others, I have short nipples and he had a hard time latching, especially because he was given a regular nippled bottle in NICU, so he didn't really want to work to learn. However, when I used one with him, it was given to me by a lactation consultant, so I knew nothing about what size it was or anything. Now that I am pregnant again, I wanted to be prepared, so that I have one already, just in case I have the same issue - because last time, it took them a long (frustrating and stressful) time to decide to suggest it, so I ordered a couple to have them handy just in case.When I opened the package, I realized that these ones (standard size) are WAY bigger than what you need for a newborn. If you try to use one of these with a newborn (you can tell just by looking at it in person) the poor baby will have more than a mouthful of plastic and it will interfere with the actual eating. So, I did some research and discovered that the best size to get for a newborn is usually the extra small one. The standard size would be more appropriate to use in an older child.So, if you are planning to buy these for use with a newborn or young baby, try the small or extra small - do some Google research - or talk to a lactation consultant - to find out more about what size is most appropriate for your baby.I will keep these, because you never know if I'll need them when she is a little older.. maybe when she gets her first tooth or something - I'll be doing skin to skin breastfeeding by then - the shield is just a precaution in case she needs help learning to latch like my son did.. but it's temporary.. so I guess if I end up needing to use a larger one later for any reason, it will be good to have them handy.
I am so eternally grateful that my lactation consultant recommended this. I couldn't get my baby to latch and this made it a breeze. I was able to stop using it after about a week. Now I default to it when feeding on the go (without my feeding pillow), when I get engorged or when baby is tired and fussy. This calms him down somehow. Love it!
I really like this shield. I have another one that doesn't have the cutout as well. I find this one stays on easier and fits better.
This product was a real life-saver for me!  I only wish I had started using it sooner.  A day or so after my daughter's birth, one of my nipples became cracked, which caused a lot of pain every time I tried to nurse on that side.  The nipple never had a chance to heal because I was breastfeeding every few hours.  Finally, after about 3 weeks of pain I decided to try this product.  It was great!  I no longer had any pain when I nursed on that side because the nipple shild created a barier, and allowed the nipple to heal.  My baby was able to nurse just fine while I was wearing this.  It did not always stay on my nipple very well, but I may not have been putting it on correctly, I now realize.  After using it for only 2 days, my nipple had healed sufficiently, and I no longer needed to use the shield.  Wonderful!  I wish I had used this after the birth of my first child, too, because I had the same issue with cracked nipples, but struggled with it much longer since I didn't know about this product.
My daughter didn't take to these at all. She got frustrated quickly.  These did help with pain while she was trying to latch on but since she would only make a few attempts before she was in hysterics we didn't use them. I am now exclusively pumping and bottle feeding. Works better for us and much less pain for me!
Had to use one of these from the start. It's comfortable and the baby doesn't mind. Easy to use. Very light weight.
Nipple shields were recommended by my lactation consultant because my newborn refused to take the breast. She was introduce to the bottle at days old due to challenges latching. She then developed nipple confusion and had no interest in the breast. She would cry when I tried to feed her from my breast which was quite depressing. I was willing to try anything. I rotated between the nipple shield and a regular bottle nipple over my nipple. She would latch for a few seconds which over time turned into a few minutes until eventually it was longer and then back to the breast. I expressed and gave her bottles in the interim to make sure she was fed. I definitely felt like giving up at times but I was fortunate to read an Amazon review where a woman said even though her little one was determined not to take the breast, she was more determined to breastfeed. That gave me the motivation that I needed. I remained patient and determined and within 3 weeks, my LO was back on the breast. She's 5 months next week and I am still breastfeeding even though I am back at work and it has been an amazing experience. Don't give up. It's worth it.Downsides to the nipples: They don't stick well to the breast so I had to use a combination of lanolin and saliva to make it stick
As a first time mom I was in tears when my 2 day old infant would latch on.  My nipples were so sore and it was so painful I was ready to give up and switch to formula. Although i thought this piece was a little expensive to try I am so glad I decided to purchase it.  What a lifesaver!! After two uses my nipples were no longer sore and I didnt dread breastfeeding! I also think this helps my baby get more milk and easier.  If youre breastfeeding and in constant pain then try this! Its well worth the $10!
Struggled a lot with breastfeeding at first, and this helped the transition to feeding without it. It is a little annoying to find and clean, but the purpose that it served saved me and enabled me to bridge the gap between learning to latch and feeding normally.
It was a pain to use sometimes especially when you're out of the house and using a cover to nurse but it is worth it. If I hadn't tried it I wouldn't have continued breastfeeding. The LC told me I would need to pump after every feeding to not diminish my supply. I did that but my supply was way too plentiful so I stopped pumping. With the shield and without pumping I have not had my supply diminish.Tips: Always have extra especially in the diaper bag. It can leak so I put a receiving blanket under my breast when he sucks.
The first few weeks of nursing are tough... my doctor recommended this, but said many lactation consultants won't suggest it.  It took the edge off of nursing and my daughter did not have any issues transitioning back to nursing without it.  I used it for about a week and was able to &#34;heal&#34; enough to handle nursing without.  Was SO helpful in the first few days of nursing when it was so painful!  I recommend these to all my pregnant friends and tell them to have it on hand just incase!
I don't think that I could have breastfed without this and it is the only reason that I continued breastfeeding.  I never had cracked or bleeding nipples.  I did not have flat or inverted nipples. I ended up buying three (just to have extras on hand because you feed more often than you can wash them).  My baby was born early and stayed in the NICU. The nurses there are adamant about your trying to breastfeed.  I heard so many horror stories.  The nurses gave me this my first day and I never had any trouble.  For the first two weeks, we used this every time he ate.  Then we used it off and on for about three more weeks (5 weeks total).  Then, by that time, we both learned how to do it and he could nurse from my breast without any aid (how to latch, how to cup your breast, etc).  My baby is now 3.5 months old and we exclusively breast feed.  He has never had nipple confusion (though we do give him a pacifier and he eats pumped milk from a bottle - but he nurses every day from the breast as well).  I feel like a dairy & I have never had trouble with supply.  At the three month checkup, my son was in the 87th percentile for weight (and that is compared to normal babies, not preemies).  It is so inexpensive to at least get one to have on hand and give it a shot.
Love the contact shield more than the regular ones. These save lives! If you have ever had cracked and bleeding nipples, you know what I mean. I have used these with both of my kids and it is well worth the inconvenience of cleaning them and having to put them on. Save the nips!
I think this thing is great!  Suction cups stick to the table - keeps things relatively close in and the tray catches a lot which our 14 month old actually will sometimes scoop up and finish off.  Cleans pretty easily but does have a bit of stain from spaghetti sauce but what in our house doesn't have some kind of stain on it with a toddler?!?!
I have not used this product much in restaurants because my little one (almost 8 months) isn't eating much in the way of solids and her grandparents always want to hold her so she is hardly in a high chair when we eat out. :o) I have used it with my high chair pulled up to the dining table and it is great at catching cheerios that she moves around the mat.  It also catches spills so I don't have to clean the table all the time.  I know it will be of more use in the next few months though.
I hate when i forget this because then I have a ton more food to collect off the floorgreat home and out
Red sauce, beets, raspberries, etc stain the rubbery plastic. I've tried putting it in the dishwasher whatever doesn't come out. The mat also ripped because my 1 year old was annoyed that it was there.
This placemat works very well; it catches most of the food that doesn't quite make it into our one-year-old little guy's mouth. Cleaning the floor isn't such a chore now. The suction cups work... we have a farmhouse-style tile-top kitchen table...just don't put the suction cups on the grout lines. No bad plastic smell. It rolls up easily and neatly for travel. Washes fine in the soapy sink with all of his other stuff... one particularly messy incident with pasta and marinara sauce did stain it a bit, but this has faded now over several uses and washes. Highly recommended. Caveat: wait until your ready to serve to put it on the table... if your little one is like ours, he/she will find it extremely amusing to pull up and roll the mat.
The Tiny Diner portable placemat is a rubber mat that includes a crumb/spill tray to bridge the gap between the table and your little one.  It secures to the table with suction cups that work with many surfaces.The mat is made of a high-quality material that should stand up to lots of use for years to come.  It cleans up easily either in the sink at home (I also called the manufacturer and found out that it's dishwasher-safe in the top rack) or else with wipes on the go.  It will protect your table at home from knicks and scratches from banging utensils and dropped cups.  It minimizes the mess all around with a lip on its border that trips minor spills and a deep tray that hangs over the edge of the table, protecting your baby's lap.  This last feature is a must-have during the independent phase of learning how to use forks and spoons.Away from home, it's a great way to let your child eat according to his or her home routine.  It also protects him or her from germs on the table.  The only drawback is in the transportation.  The mat is a little like a roadmap - you'll never get it folded back as nicely as when it first arrived.  As a result, it can take up a lot of space in a small daytime/afternoon diaper bag.Judging from other reviews, it seems that this is yet another in the long list of love-it-or-hate-it items that are subject to your child's tastes.  Based on our experience, the Tiny Diner is certainly worth a try for its low price - if you can get your toddler used to using it, it will become invaluable.PROS*  Traps all sort of crumbs and spills, including a tray between table and baby*  Protects your table from bumps and scratches*  Durable - I can't imagine it wearing out*  Easy to clean and maintainCONS*  Doesn't fold up very well
They may be a bit expensive but we love these for our one year old son.  The pocket in the front catches a lot of food and the suction cups work well on our table.  When he really tugs, it will move but you can't expect a miracle.  It definitely makes the after-meal clean up a lot easier.Update: Three years later we are using the same mat for our daughter and it's identical to the day we boguht it.  We take it with us to restaurants.  It rolls up so easily that you can put it right into the diaper bag without cleaning it too much and it contains the mess until you get home.  Love it!
I bought this w/ the hippo travel high chair.  It worked great and kept things cleaner.  Unfortunately it was in the case w/ the chair when it was stolen out of our truck.
I wanted to love this mat as an alternative to disposable mats in restaurants. It's so cool how it rolls up and stores in a small space.However when unrolled, it wants to curl right back up. Because it's fairly impossible to get the mat to lie flat, the suction cups won't actually stick to anything. Please note: I have pretty low expectations with suction cups in general. I don't expect magic and know I'll have to re-stick them throughout use. But this mat just doesn't stick to anything in the first place.
I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about.  But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off.  Plus when we were all done, I had to try to clean it off as best I could, then put it in my diaper bag-yuck!I much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table.
I bought the placemat for travel purposes for my 15 month old who loves to self-feed but will throw plates around if they are in front of him.  In theory, this placemat is a great idea but the suctions are not strong enough for a toddler; he had this thing off the table in 15 seconds.  Now it is sitting in the closet.  I hate wasting money.
I would recommend this product . This is a great product. No mess and easy clean up. My son loves it.
My 9mo old loves to suck on the table every time we go out to eat and that's just gross. So this place mat is perfect. It rolls up easily so it fits easily into the diaper bag. And the suction cups on the bottom keep it firmly in place on the table. The little tray in front catches SOME of the food he drops... Plus, it's easy to clean. I love it!
We tried this placemat along with the disposable ones and neither worked for us.  This one was just too bulky to carry in her bag...it never folded back up to the size it was in the box.  We also had trouble getting it to stick to tables.  The least little bit of moisture or texture and it wouldn't work.  On the rare occasions that we could get it to work then we had to deal with cleaning it.  Wipes didn't work and napkins were even worse.  Most times my husband or I had to head off to the restroom to try to get it clean enough to take home.  It honestly was more trouble than it was worth.  We finally just opted for cleaning wipes in her bag...we clean the heck out of her area of the table and then just let her have at it.  When she's done we clean up her mess.I understand the theory behind this product but it needs works before it's a real benefit and must have item.
My baby is just entering the world of self-feeding, but I predict I will use this more than I already do.  It provides an ingenious and clean alternative to dishes, which tempt little hands with ulterior motives.  It does take up it's fair share of space, however, on the often crowded/too small restaurant tables, so if you're with a group, count your baby in the party, so she gets her own space and you can keep yours too. If you dine out w/ your baby often, this is a must.
This idea is so great.  It helps contain the mess left on restrauant floors. Plus you can recycle the food!
the green, pink, & blue versions (with the cow jumping over the moon) are perfect for restaurants that don't have tablecloths.  easy to wash and store in the diaper bag.  yellow (hippo) version seems different -- sticks to itself a bit too much but is still effective.  i don't recommend the yellow one unless you just LOVE yellow.  yes, there really is a difference!
I love this product. So much so, in fact, that I bought a second one so that I could keep one at home and one in the diaper bag. The high chair that I own (Keekaroo - also highly recommended) has a tray but can also push up directly to the table. I prefer to push my little one up to the table so she can dine right there with us - as a family. I just put this on the table and I can put an assortment of different messy foods right on it.It rolls up quickly and easily and when you're on the go, the mess rolls up with it and doesn't escape so you don't end up with crumbs in your diaper bag. It cleans easily and there are no icky chemicals in it.I can even attest to fabulous customer service from Kiddopatamus. My Tiny Diner came in contact with some newspaper in my bag and I couldn't get the newsprint off it. I contacted them and they recommended rubbing some oil on it. I did and it came right off. Fabulous! Buy two!
The suction cups are worthless.  When this arrived, I tried it one time and my son threw the entire meal on the floor within about half a minute.  I am mad at whoever designed this stupid thing, let alone decided it was worth $12 (including shipping!).  It is still, a week later, curled up (won't lay flat) and the suction cups don't stick to anything.  More of a toy than a placemat.  I am back to the disposable placemats with sticky stuff on the back.
I liked this mat, it's very functional and is so easy to carry on. The only thing is that in some tables the mat is not still but it's definitely the kind of table, otherwise I have no problems.
After spending nearly an hour trying to get roasted sweet potato and roasted carrots smooth enough for my baby using a spoon and strainer and a food processor, I decided to give this mill a try.  It's worked out very well for me so far.  I've used it for pears, avocado and roasted red peppers (those were a little harder).  The avocado was still a little lumpy for me, so I just ran into through the mill again and that helped get out a lot of the tiny chunks.  For making simple baby food, this product fits the bill.
This is a great food mill. So far I have only used on fruits/veg but just love it. When I make dinner for the family it almost always includes a roasted veg of some sort. Now I just roast a small portion of the veggies without the salt and toss them in the food mill, add a little water and presto! Dinner is ready! I wouldn't recommend this for a baby who is just starting with solids. This doesn't give you the pureed, smooth consistancy of Stage 1 baby food in a jar. It's a little more lumpy but still easily eaten by a baby without teeth. It also worked really well on veg that still had a 'bite' to them. They were fork tender but not mushy. This food mill turned them into baby food quickly. Will be using this nightly from now on.
After feeding my first child store bought baby food I was on the hunt for a product that would soften my budget while being moderately easy to operate and clean. I went for this one because I didn't want to be making big batches of baby food at a time - way too busy for that- and wanted to be able to just pop in something from the table for my baby girl to eat. My first try was strawberries and while it seemed to work it really just pressed all the juices out of them and really did little to the berries other than press them and leave them under the plastic grate. I added some rice cereal to the juice and pressed on determine to make it work. My next try was some spinach pasta with sauce. I first tried it with the pasta just the way it was and all it did was twirl the pasta around the blades. Next, I tried cutting it into about one inch pieces and added a couple of the red peppers that were in the sauce (and very soft and well cooked). After pressing down with all my might while trying to spin it without snapping the arm off all I again got was very pressed food and little 'ground' food for my baby to eat. I pressed on with chopped and peeled apples, finely cut up into about pencil eraser size. I was rewarded with several spoonfuls of apple sauce but when I went to clean the device I found that about 80% of the apples I had put in had just been pressed, had the juice squeezed out and were still in the tube below the blades. NOT worth the trouble for a busy mom. May work okay if you steam and peel all fruits and veggies but I was looking for something to make my life easier, not create more work. I read so hopefully the reviews about this product grinding meat and just can't make it come anywhere close to producing an edible result. Busy moms beware!
I registered for this because I remembered my mom grinding my "baby" sister's food 20+ years ago.  I figured it could not hurt to have.My little one is almost 1 year old and still doesn't have teeth. She gums things very well, but meats are a little harder to tear apart.  (Note, this was great when we started solids... it mashed bananas and took the strings out of sweet potatoes to give them a smoother texture than just mashing with a fork.) We're introducing her to meats slowly, and anytime I've tried to give her canned commercial meats, she has scoffed at them and pushed them away.  Well, tonight she eyed my pork chop jealously, as if her cooked mixed veggies were not enough.  I ground up between 1-2 ounces and added some water to it to smooth the texture, and she LOVED it.  She could have eaten more, but she had plenty to eat in addition to the meat.  Although it took a little longer to grind the meat, I did so sufficiently.This grinder washes up well.. I rinse it off, take it apart, and throw it in the dishwasher. I have had no problems with this grinder.  It does it's job as well as I would expect any non-electrical grinder to work. I wish I  had the tote, but a ziplock baggie works fine.I would also like to add that I had to contact Kidco's customer service regarding finding replacement hardware for a baby gate, and they were prompt and professional.
I purchased this food mill to make food for my five month old baby girl.  I will say that it does work very well for SOME foods but not all.  As you can expect, it works great with soft foods such as banana and avocado.  It does work with other things such as peas, broccoli, and pears but I found that it still left the food grainy and not smooth enough for my baby who is still eating stage one foods.  I had to put those things in the blender to puree them further.  I did like that it separated the stings from the sweet potatoes which helped a lot. Overall, I think it was worth the money.  You can even put it in a baggy and take it along.  Maybe I will use it more once my baby starts stage 2 foods.
For the price, and the time it takes to "mill" my baby's food, this product by far gets 5 stars. I take a small portion of our freshly cooked food, and run it thru the mill. 2 minutes later I have baby food for my child. It can't get any easier than that! AND ON TOP OF IT ALL, I know exactly what's in my baby's food!
This is such a great, simple door lock. Five starts for its functionality and simplicity. We should have gotten this a lot sooner!
My two year old simply slid open his closet like normal and both "wings" snapped right off, allowing  him access.  Waste of $.
I looked everywhere for a device to keep the sliding doors of our entertainment center closed - those little ones love to open the doors and push all the buttons!  With a slight modification it works great on our Potterybarn cabinet.  I ordered extras for the closet doors - although my son hasn't quite found them yet.  Definitely worth the couple bucks!!!
I was concerned about what would happen to my nice cabinet when I tried to remove these so I used two 3M strips instead of the adhesive it came with. It went on without a problem and has been working well. I know the strips will remove easily as I've used them on all kinds of surfaces before. The lock itself is very easy to operate and my 2 y/o girls just aren't that interested in figuring it out so it serves its purpose well so far. I just wish it came in other colors than white.
I have two of these installed on sliding cabinet doors.  The doors are wood with a glossy melamine coating, and the locks have stayed securely stuck for over a year.  They are simple for an adult to use - use thumb and finger to push both tabs down at the same time, then slide door open.  As long as there is 1/8" or so of clearance between the doors, they will slide freely with the lock compressed between them.  Upon closing the doors, the lock's wings snap out again, and the doors are automatically locked - easy!  Our son (now 23 months) has not put great effort in trying to defeat the lock, but I think it would be physically very difficult for a child his age to do so.  He could easily apply the pressure necessary to press the wing down, but to maintain that pressure on both wings while simultaneously opening the door is a tall order for a toddler.On the flip side, while investigating the lock one day, he pulled down hard on the top wing, and it snapped right off.  He went right over to our other cabinet, and snapped the top wing off the lock on that one.  He hasn't yet tried to break off the bottom wings, and I believe that would be more difficult to do, but I docked this product a star for the easily-broken plastic.  It was fully effective until age 23 months, I haven't found any alternatives that are as convenient as this, and for the time being, it remains effective even with one broken wing, so it still gets four stars.
Won't stick to doors, fell right off.  Completely useless.  I've got similar ones that the prior owners of my house installed that work great, they hold quite securely.  These are not the same, unfortunately.
I purchased many locks and this one is the best.  The toilet seat still can be lifted up but the toddler pretty much get the idea that it's not gonna happen.  Just make sure you have a good toilet seat that's not flimsy.
This lock is better than most of the locks on the market.  It is much more sturdy than the flimsy stuff I'd found at the local 'R Us store.  We purchased three locks and have had two of them installed so far for about two months.  That being said, you need to make sure the toilet lock snaps back into place after closing the toilet lid.  It does not always do so on either of our toilets, but we have the padded toilet seat and lids.  Also know that most toilet seat and lids have a little white plastic cover that goes over the screws that attach the lid to the toilet.  You will have to remove those; they won't work with the toilet lock.Also, you need two hands to open the lock- one to push the button in and one to move the lock back.  If you are going to the toilet to rinse a diaper that could be a bit awkward, but a minor inconvenience in exchange with your child's safety, I think.  A good product that I would recommend to others with curious tots running around.
Bought this to keep our baby boy safe&#8230; this can't be installed with the toilet seat we have. It is a random seat from BB&Beyond&#8230; I feel they should have mentioned this that it won't fit all seats&#8230; only the ones who are entirely screwed on. Ours has snaps that snap into place so this thing can't be attached properly. Will have to return it.
These are a must have if you use Avent bottles. They are great for storing breast milk in the fridge or freezer. They're also good for on the go.
The do the job. Great thing to have for capping the bottles to store pumped breast milk or baby food when baby gets older.
It's helpful being able to have &#34;lids&#34; for the bottles other than nipples for when you either need to shake formula or store breastmilk in the fridge.
Use these for breast milk storage in my Avent bottles. Saves me money because I don't have to buy as many breast milk storage bags. I wish I had the space and money to only use bottles because these don't leak and I have had no problem with them not sealing properly in the freezer.
Using these on Natural bottles. They work. I fit them on the white ring first, then put on bottle.  I like that I can save some space using these instead of nipples and covers.
I was hesitant to buy these because of the price for little pieces of plastic, but they are a must! The Avent system makes life SO much easier, and these discs are part of that!
I read a lot of reviews about how the natural bottles leak.  But one review gave the tip of using this with the Philip Avent classic bottle screw rings.  We haven't used them yet with the natural bottles as the baby won't be here till July, but I tried one one with a bottle ring on a Philip Avent natural bottle and it honestly felt like it all came together with a snap and was extremely secure.  Don't think we will be getting any leaks!  I will probably test these out by putting some water in the bottle along with using the screw rings and sealing discs to see if it leaks.
I wasn't sure if these would work with my Avent Natural bottles, but they work great. You just put it on in place of the nipple. It snaps highly into the white screw ring.I don't use them often since just storing and traveling with the full bottle regularly assembled works just fine.
Does what it's supposed to do, doesn't leak.  I find it very convenient that you can turn your bottles into storage containers. I recommend the whole Avent line from the pump to these sealers.
I bought these discs after my little one moved from the 4oz bottle to the 9oz bottles. They allow me to use the smaller bottles to store breast milk, formula and water. They work well on my Avent natural 4oz and 9oz. bottles and can be sterilized in microwave steam bags.
I must be doing something wrong because it leaks. What is the point if it isn't air tight? I just use the regular bottle tops.  However, this is not a knock against the Avent system, these are my favorite bottles, the only ones to decrease spit-up!
These disks fit into the Avent lids and allow to seal the bottles for storage. They are helpful and work just as advertised. I will mention though that I can't stand how the Avent bottles require that little ring before putting on the lids. I often forget to put on the ring and all lmy precious milk pours out of the bottle. Fortunately the newer Avent models no longer require that silly ring!
I pump into Avent bottles at work, so I purchased these for transport. These are very durable and clean easily. When you buy the Avent bottles, these are NOT included. I honestly don't even pop these out before cleaning the screw-on caps that these insert into, because they clean really well as one unit. Once baby no longer feeds from bottles, these discs will be great to transport food when we're on the go or otherwise traveling.
Having a newborn means that you live in world of disarray.  It also means that you are perpetually and endlessly washing bottles and making formula.  Half the time we can't find a nipple and just need to seal the bottle and get it in the fridge--ENTER these bottle sealing discs.They create a tight seal and pop in and out easily.  They will also prove useful later on if we want to use a bottle to hold cheerios or fruit loops:)
I love this whole Avent system of being able to do everything in one bottle without transferring my pumped milk. These work well on the Avent natural bottles they seal so well I can even freeze the milk in the bottle I haven't had any issue with leaking of any kind they work very well
You get 6 which is a bonus since it only shows 2.When I boiled them 2 of them warped but still made it work.
These snap right into place and keep a secure seal. I use wet erase markers to mark the date on top. A good investment for added convenience.
Fits all avent toxic plastic bottles and the non toxic sportster/magic cups. Does not fit VIA, one of the 2 non toxic plastic bottles avent has.
These discs are great for using Avent bottles to store breastmilk (which I loved) but also great for sealing off bottles while on the go (Breast milk, water, formula, juice any liquid)
Bought these with the avent standard breast pump conversion kit so I was able to pump directly into my bottles and not have more pump bottles to clean every day.  I think I'd be pumping for 6 months before I found these, and I wished I'd found them sooner!  These are also just great for portability to make sure your bottles don't spill.  Highly recommend getting these if you use Avent bottles.
I became very happy to get this. The product is produced with good material. I recommend to everyone. Buy it
These were a waste of money as they did not fit my bottles properly and the bottles did not seal and leaked.  I threw them away.
Cheapest place to buy them is on Amazon. You get a package of 6 for this price. They work great to seal bottles, and it's always nice to have extras of these, especially if you're going to freeze/store your milk.
We limped along without these sealing lids for so long until I saw them on Amazon. It allowed us to prepare bottles ahead of time as I felt more comfortable using these for sealing instead of the normal Avent nipple/cap combo. It was also nice to throw a few sealed bottles into the diaper bag and then just pop the disc out and swap with a nipple when we were ready to feed the baby. They take up so much less room in the fridge or diaper bag compared to having a nipple on the bottles. We never had any leaks or other issue. I am just glad to have found them.
This makes it so easy when we travel. We can store the water in here and just add the formula when he's ready to eat.
These discs work well with avent products. They also fit in my Lansinoh bottles.
I have three Avent bottles but sealing discs didn't come with them.  These are great and serve my needs well to be able to have a bottle that will travel well.
I'm happy with the sealing discs; this will be great for keeping milk in my natural avent bottles! So far loving them.
I bought this for my son about 7 months ago and he did like it at first but it should be made a little bigger. It hurts his legs when using the deflector part and you have to use that part with a boy. Maybe this potty is better for a girl but definately not a boy. Also it is hard to clean with too many cracks and sometimes it leaks. The only part me and my son liked was he liked to pull the container out by himself and empty it thats why i gave it the 2 stars i did.I never even used the music part of it so i cannot review that but i think that it is useless.I have decided just to buy a soft kids seat for the big toilet and a step stool. I would not buy this potty again. I would recommend you research other pottys on the market because this is no good.If fisher price improved this potty by making it a little bigger for boys and improved some other things, then it probably would be the best potty.
This is a great buy.  It sings to your child when they sit down and plays a tune when they actually go.  My little one loves it and even knows how to empty it!  You can't go wrong with this one - it's just really cute and comfortable.  Not to mention VERY easy to clean!
I have a little girl and she started using this potty chair at a year old (early, but just to get the concept!)... she has loved it since day one!  She was entertained by the music which was a great incentive for her to stay a little longer on the potty, and when she was ready it transfers and snaps onto the &quot;big girl potty&quot; and still plays music!  She is now two and uses just the big potty but every now and then she still asks for this!  We didn't get much use out of the potty book that comes with it, but it's a cute idea.  All in all this was a good choice for us!
I loved this potty because of its look and its easy to remove bottom makes for easy cleaning.  My Son has about 4 different potties between ours and Grandmas houses and this is by far the easiest to clean!  However, it leaks all over the floor.  I solved this problem by purchasing an inexpensive (but cute) bath rug.  I clean it every other day by taking it in the shower with me.  The thinner the mat the faster it will dry when hung.Now my three year old likes to sit on the big potty, but with his "boy equipment" its hard for him to hold himself up and hold his equipment down.  I removed the legs from the potty and it clicks right into the toilet seat.  The leaking is no longer a problem!  I would purchase this potty all over again...its worth the hastle.
I bought this potty seat for my son thinking it looked great and fisher-price ALMOST ALWAYS makes great things, but I was wrong with this one.  First of all, the music plays only when the chair is moved...it hardly plays when my son goes potty on it.  Secondly, I would NOT recommed this seat for a boy.  The "protector" is there for decoration only, at least that's what it seems to me...and let's not even talk about the book that was easily torn apart by a 15 month old...I should have bought the potty chair that can also be used as a stool, at least I could have got some use out of that...
I received this as a gift at my baby shower and my daughter loves these toys! They are colorful and fun to play with. It has bath toys, great teether toys and fun rattles. I highly recommend this set to any parent.
You save a lot of money when you buy this in bulk rather than buying them individually. There has been a new toy that fits my daughter's development from 2 weeks to 6 months. She had enjoyed each toy so far!
Excellent set put  together  by Sassy. It  will keep  your infant delighted for months. Most of the toys can  be easily  cleaned. Our  son  enjoyed  discovering them and stared for good  minutes  at them when he was a  newborn. He' s  now playing with them and will happily reach for  them although he' s  had them from day 1. They are also  excellent stroller toys.Update: our  son is 5  months old  and is still playing with these toys. After multipl  cleanings  they look like new and colors are still bright and pretty.
My son is finally at an age where toys really interest him. He tries to reach for anything that grabs his attention. I bought this set as I hoped it had a little bit of everything in case he gets bored of one particular item we just switch to another. I really like the variety in this box.Before handing any of these to my son, I made sure I washed them in warm water with mild "kid safe" soap. The only drawback was that, while soaking in water, some of these toys got water in them. I had to get a blowdryer to dry the water (and dampness) out. Beware the camera on this package has a battery which I mistakenly soaked in water.My baby is enjoying the vivid colors and interesting sounds this set has to offer.
These things are great.There are two strips of sticky stuff that holds these place mats down to the table. They are sticky enough that it takes some time to work the place mat off of the table if your child tries. Yet they do not ruin any furniture.The mats are very useful for a variety of purposes and places. We have used ours to protect our table when painting. WE use them all the time when we are eating out. THis is very good for the young finger feeding child. You can put small bits of food right in front of him and not worry about a plate getting broken because the child threw it on the floor. When you are through eating, you simply roll this up and throw it away. Mess is gone.Excellent. Useful. I carry them in my purse at all times.Well worth every penny.
I am not a neat freak but the thought of my toddler eating of tables that look like they haven't been cleaned in who knows how long really grossed me out. We tried using plates but that is usually short lived with my son. These are the perfect solution.  I always keep a few in my diaper bag. My one complaint is that out of my pack of 50, about 12 were defective and coulnd't be used.  Don't know if anyone else has had this issue.
We've been using these since my son started eating solids (it's been a long while, he's 21 months now). I always carry them with me wherever I go and wouldn't know what to do without them. Just peel the back and stick on any suface, we even use them at restaurants where they have tablecloths. When my son's finished eating I just peel it off the table, roll it into a ball and into the garbage it goes. It's sanitary, helps keep the mess under control and my son LOVES to see his "friends" (cookie, elmo, big bird etc.) as he's eating. You have to buy these, they are incredible!
My three year old son loves these cars. They are tough with big parts so there is no fear of him chocking.  He loves the noise they make when they roll too.
I got these for my son when he turned 12 months on the basis of the very positive reviews here. At first, I regretted the choice, seeing that my son didn't take to the cars right away. Then, at about 14 or 15 months, he really got into them. The cranking sound intrigued him and like most boys, he fell in love with all cars, buses, and trucks.He is now 20 months and still enjoys playing with the cars, but he hasn't yet figured out that you must face each car forward in order to get it to move forward quickly with the cranking motion (as opposed to just pushing it). He loves to make the cranking sound himself, but he often does it with the car turned backwards. I used to spend a bit of time trying to show him how to do this and then gave up, but I will tackle this challenge again with him and see what happens. Perhaps only my child has this problem with the cars, but he doesn't have any developmental delays, as far as his doctor can determine!I agree with other reviewers that the cars are a little expensive for what they are, but they are of decent size and seem sturdy. I'd expect something closer to $20, $25 max, rather than $30 or $35. Of course, if your child loves the cars and spends a lot of time with them, you will not mind the extra $10!
We have these in our church nursery and they are really fun cars! When I work in there I play with them with the little ones and we race them. They work great on the carpet there, although it is very thin and flat. I liked them so much that I bought some recently for my daughter (4) and son (11 months) and we do the same thing with them at home on the tile - race them. My son loves crawling after them and trying to get them to "go" on his own. He also loves banging them around and they've held up really good. They are soft rubber material so he can chew on them too. Fun, fun, fun!
I bought this instead of a Boppy before I had my son. It looked and felt much more substantial and at the time it was cheaper. Now they are about the same price, I think. I love this pillow. It is large enough for even bigger babies and really saves your arms and back when you are nursing or bottle feeding. Also it is great for when your baby starts to sit up. I have used it for tummy time too. My only complaint is that it is spot clean only. The tag discourages wash since the cover might shrink. Other than that, great baby pillow!
This is a big pillow and your baby will like it, I got this for my newborn and she love it!!
Worth every penny. My wife uses it daily for feeding infant. We are very happy with this pillow. Sitting position and angle is perfect for infants.
I like it. Would have given it five stars if it had been just a bit taller so that it can really be used as a sitting support for baby's back. Otherwise, pleased with the quality.
There are several different Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing pillows available and they are not all created equal.  For some crazy reason the pink one in not removable so the washing instructions state to simply spot clean...gross!  I sent this one back and found another one that is removable/Machine washable.
This pillow is a comfy place for the baby to sit while also being a comfortable nursing pillow. I actually didn't use it very long for a nursing pillow because we had some latch issues that required unique positioning but the time that I did use it for that was great. My favorite part is the strap that hold the baby. This is a feature you won't on other nursing pillows. I've used two others and this is my favorite. And you can't beat the price!
This pillow is bigger and fuller than my boppy pillow.  I agree with the other posters that said that it would be nice if the cover came off for washing, but I have just followed the recommendation of another reviewer and put a receiving blanket under my baby's head when he's nursing.  The strap that goes around the baby velcros to the underside of the pillow, so it can be difficult to get the velcro in place without jostling the baby.  All in all, I prefer this pillow to my boppy just because it's a bigger pillow so it positions the baby better for nursing.  Also, one reviewer noted that the pillow didn't fit around her.  I have no problems with fit and I am a size 18 pre-pregnancy.  I would definitely recommend this pillow.
I ordered not even knowing I need it or not, but my friend said I did the right thing, cause it is really comfortable pillow.
I have two of these pillows. It is basically the &#34;boppy&#34; but it has a little strap to hold your baby in (like in the picture).I just didn't like how the cover does not come off, but you can easily wash them. It has helped with her sitting up on her own as well.Good buy for a baby shower too!
I like this pillow, much better priced than the Boppy.  I thought it came with a washable/removable cover, but it doesn't.  I guess I'll just throw the whole thing in the washing machine and hope for the best!
If you want your baby on the couch with you, this is perfect. It holds baby securely!!My granddaughter has sat in this from day one instead of lying flat. It really helps withreflux and gas problems too. Get one, you'll be soo glad you did.
I LOVED THIS PILLOW...GOT IT FOR OUR NEW GRAND SON,,,,I CHOSE THIS ONE BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY BELT....BABIES DO NOT SLIP OUT.....
The pillow provides decent support for the baby while feeding, but only allows for spot cleaning. And let's face it. Spilled milk and spit up need to be thoroughly washed from the material. I am going to have to buy a washable cover. Might as well have bought a slightly more expensive pillow.
I love the strap on it. Came in very handy when my baby was small. Now shies 14months so I don't use the straps but she loves to take her naps on the pillow. Fits inside her play pen.
I got this to help my daughter learn to sit up, so when she toppled she wouldn't crash on the floor. But I also ended up using it to nurse her even though she's 6 months old. It's very comfortable and I think softer than the Boppy so it's easier to smush into place. It also makes a nice comfy pillow for me when reading in bed! Good buy over all.
I purchased this item over the Boppy pillow because of the velcro seat wrap.  It keeps my baby in place without him sliding downwards which I have witnessed with other babies using the Boppy pillow.  Boppy pillow covers can used with this Leachco pillow.  When my baby is too big for the velcro seat wrap, I will be using Boppy pillow covers on this pillow.  The lack of the removable cover is a disadvantage for cleaning purposes.
This pillow is awesome! My breastfriend pillow sucks. This one is awesome for babies with acid reflux and then a feeding pillow when baby is older. We still use it for breastfeeding and I love it. I can actually sit back and relax when feeding my baby. Also I got mine for $19.99 because I got a different color. Its a bit lame that a color/print changes the price. I will be gifting one to my friend. Love this pillow!
THIS IS SO PERFECT IN SO MANY WAYS, HE CAN WATCH TV, HE CAN PLAY, I CAN BREASTFEED HIM OR JUST TAKE A NAPPY WITH ME. LOVE IT! =0)
This item was perfect for our son and now our 5 day old newborn daughter. We use this for propping her up, breastfeeding and relaxing on. Our son had one identical in a boy color and we purchased this item in the pink with white polka-dot style. In LOVE and we use on a daily basis.
In short words: To let baby rest or tummy time:cuddle-u  //for nursing, tummy time, and assisted sitting:boppyI have tried both the cuddle-u nursing pillow with the strap, and the boppy nursing pillow. Before anything I'd like to mention I NEVER used these for nursing, it never worked for me that way I simply didn't get the hang of it. However, I wanted something to lay him down and have him feel he was still in our arms. These both hold the same purpose, though I like the fact that the cuddle-u has the strap (which I hardly ever used because it seems uncomfortable for my son's chubby legs. Though I do like that the cuddle-u sinks in a little where he lays his head because it makes it safer when he wiggles around, he doesn't fall in between (which poses a hazard) The boppy seems more ideal for someone who is actually going to use this pillow for nursing or helping baby sit because it doesn't get "flat" as easy as the cuddle u. For that reason it is clear that the boppy makes a better nursing pillow, because you don't want it sinking in... cuddle-u makes a great napping pillow. can't beat the price! I purchased it for $24.99, it is now $19.99
Of course I haven't used this yet, and I'm looking forward to it.  I like the size and I like the versatility -- for baby and for me.
Great product for anyone with a newborn! Love using it not only or breast feeding, but also when bottle feeding in order to rest my arm on.  It's also a great pillow to assist my 5 week old in sitting up.  It gets used on a daily basis at our house and is one of my top must haves for moms! Only thing I wish it had is slipcovers.  I haven't braved putting the whole pillow in the wash yet.
I purchased My Brest Friend for my daughter-in-law when she had her first child and it was fine.  However, since this has the option of sitting a baby in it and the baby is secure made this a great option for both nursing and having the baby lie on the bed safely while in a semi-upright position.
seeing that baby sometimes feeds for as much as an hour this has been a lifesaver I HIGHLY recommend it! I would suggest a cover if you can get one because the pillow kind of lets out some of the stuffing.
I use it more for baby to lay on, she loves it - I'm so happy I got this and use it constantly . I'm bottle feeding so I'm not sure how good it is for nursing, but it's great for baby to lay on and look around, she does tummy time on ot too, and the seatbelt strap is great, keeps her from slipping - she's a squirm worm and only 6 weeks. She's laying on it right now as I type! :)
I bought this because of the cover and strap.  My son loved to sit in the boppy but would end up sliding down.  For that purpose this is a great pillow.  It is softer than the boppy and more snugly.  As a nursing pillow I found it to be too squishy and soft.
This is a plus soft pillow that gets used daily with my 3 month old. I dont find the straps annoying at all as they are good for safety to prevent baby from slipping out of the pillow. I DO let her take naps in it while being supervised and she loves it. Must have for all new moms.
Great for breast feeding, Bottle feeding and having your little just lounge in general. Great quality does the job and she seems to think it's comfy.
This is one of the things I couldn't live without as a new first time mom.  We ended up ordering one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  I use it everytime I nurse and the baby likes to sit on it as well as be propped up on it for tummy time.  It is such a great price and the pillow is great quality.  DEFINITELY order this one if you are choosing a nursing pillow.
I place it in the crib when the baby is congest and she sleep in there because is not too soft so she can stay firm, I do breastfeed with that too
This product is really helpful. My baby is 3 month old. My baby and I love it. Before my back always in pain because i have to hold my baby to feed her. now she sit on her own all i need to do is hold the bottle for her. all moms should own 1 of this
I wished I had one of these when I had my son 2 years ago from all the backaches from not sitting up straight while breastfeeding. I cam across this and decided to buy for my newborn baby and I loved it. I used it nursing and also to put her in to keep her head up
I like this better than Boppy for its firmness and the lap belt.  The lap belt tucks away if you don't want to use it, but it's so handy..my older 2 children used to slide down the boppy and end up laying flat on their back when they were in a squirmy mood.  Quality is great!Downside: you must purchase a cover if you want to protect this pillow, it doesn't come with one (I bought sage green pillow.) Last I checked on amazon you could get the pillow and a cover for about the same price as a Boppy that already comes with a washable cover, so not really a big deal!
Any breast feeding mom knows your arm starts to get tired so this is such a life saver. I HATE the pink, its so bright and noticeable but for the price I can deal. They had other material options but it upped the price like double. I even bought two, one for work the other for home. I can use it as a little chair and its so comfy she falls asleep.
My baby is 10days old today and I've been using this pillow for both breast feeding and a place for her to hang out with us on the couch. She gets strapped in and sleeps on the pillow on the couch (supervised, of course). I almost want another one for upstairs so I don't have to carry it everywhere, highly recommend over the actual boppy pillow.
I received this pillow as a present.  I had actually put the Boppy version on my registry but a friend gave this one to me instead, swearing that it was far more useful.  After much use, I can agree that she was totally correct.  It is not only a great aid when feeding my baby (helps with arm fatigue) but is also a great and comfy place to lay my baby when I want to do quick chores around the house.  I place my baby in it and in a place where I continuously have him in view while I do my chores and it is so comfy for him that he often falls asleep in it.  Its fiber filling has gotten softer over time and just becomes cozier for him every day.  So glad I got this over the Boppy version.  The straps make this so much better.
I bought it for breastfeeding before. Since I went back to work and no longer breastfeed my baby, I used it as a cushion for my back while bottle feeding her. Now I'm using it as a cushion for my baby and she sit on it like the picture and she seems like enjoy it.
Great pillow. I like this better than the boppy. Its a little bigger. I love the strap, helps so baby doesn't slip down and more secure as well. I also love how I can just throw it in the washer and it dries very quick. My daughter loves it. I use it for feeding, tummy time and just sitting with the straps. Wish there was more material options but not a big deal. Best of all you can't beat the price. So glad I got this over the boppy.
good .I love this pillow so much. It works great with breastfeeding and my son sleeps so well on it.
Due to the good reviews by others, this product might just not be the right fit for my baby. When he is sitted in the position just like the one in the picture, my baby did not look comfortable. His head seem to be tilted back slightly ( so the neck is not supported to be straight). I guess it just didn't work out for us
I give this item 4 loves b/c it's the best. I've had a Bobby since my dd was born on 8.20 and used it for nursing and it was great. She loved to just kick back on it too. She has bad reflux and so I always leave her propped up. However, she's begun to roll and dive! The bobby isn't safe unless it's on the floor! She also rolls right over it or gets stuck down in it and rolls her face into it and it scares the crap out of me. I got this at Walmart b/vc BabiesRUs never shipped the one I ordered and Wallie's had it for $23.99. It keeps her propped up at an angle better than the Bobby and I can strap her in so she doesn't scoot her way out. I don't think this would work well for nursing, but it's the best for bottle feeding, reflux, and lounging around in. I wish I had this before I spent $40 on a Bumbo too, b/c it offers support for sitting too. The only thing I'm not too happy about is that it doesn't have a washable cover and we all know any baby makes a mess, let alone a baby with reflux!
Wife liked it and thats all I cared for :-). Specially when the other pillows are double the price at some places. I went by the logic that if one goes bad or gets dirty I can always buy another one and still only spend the same amount of money as the other ones.
This is perfect for tummy time! Allows my little guy to sit up without falling or squirming out of it. He also gets some tummy time in on here!
So many things you can do with this pillow. Mom can use it when feeding. Baby when laying, help with sitting,tummy time, very versatile.
This reminds me of the pregnancy pillow I used to sleep on -- same kind of feel and support. I bought it for my 5 week old baby who likes to be held a lot. She doesn't quite fit the harness but this does surround her very well and looks like she's being cuddled. It could be a 5-star product if only the cover was removeable -- already had a few spit ups but at least they wipe away pretty clean. I was hoping I could use this for my fussy baby to sleep in but the pillow comes w/a warning tag that states specifically to NOT let a baby sleep in this...***update***I have been using this for tummy time since my baby was 3 months old. She is now 6.5 months and still loves to watch the world while propped up on this pillow. The u-shape helps keep her up comfortably and holds her in if she tries to roll over.
It is bigger than I expected and definitely much bigger than any nursing U pillow out in stores. The color is exactly like in the pictures. So cute! Baby loves it. It is so cushioned. Just perfect! Ive been using it since day 1 and my baby is now 6m. It still has its cushion and keeps its shape. She now uses it for tummy times and sitting as well as laying on it. The straps/Velcro are really strong and so hold up. If your baby can sit up and move around, he/she will most likely take the whole pillow with of strapped on it. So I just dont strap my baby any longer in it. The sitting strap was only useful for when she was 5m and younger. It kept her secure enough to not go forward and fall off the bed or something.
I used these bottles and had no problems whatsoever.  They helped with gas yet were not a pain to clean (like the Dr. Brown's bottles...oh my gosh...talk about time consuming).  Others mentioned leaking around the bottom of the bottle; I had a bottle leak one time but soon realized I did not have the plastic disc in place completely.  I readjusted the disc and everything was fine.  Also, I have put the bottles together many times with them still wet and have had no problems.
I bought these after my Avent bottles started to leak. At first they were okay, but then my son had trouble feeding from them. The flow was too slow and when I made the whole bigger it was too fast. Also you have to check every new nipple to make sure there is a hole at all! IF you tighten the bottom too much, the baby can't get any milk. Whenever I used these, I kept having to stop my son from eating to make sure he was not just sucking air. Also the nipple collapes ALL THE TIME. Try the Playtex Premium Nurser. It works much better.
Good if you are not able to or choose not to breastfeed. My son would only take this kind of nipple and due to the shape and style of this bottle, it helps with preventing gas.
I love these bottles though a little more timely to clean they really help with gas. I have used the natural shape nipple until now as a transition between breast and bottle because it most resembled my nipple shape and my son did great.
The angled design of these bottles make them easy to hold, and our daughter doesn't make a huge mess with these bottles like she has with others.  I also like how the bottom removes, so it is a lot easier to get them completely clean.  She has a healthy appetite, so she quickly outgrew the smaller size by the time we stopped breastfeeding.  I would suggest just getting the 3 pack of a bigger size rather than this newborn gift set.
We returned the Avent bottles and bought more Playtex VentAire instead.  Isaiah is 3 mo's old and he has used Stage 2 nipples from birth.  He enjoys drinking from the Playtex VentAire much more than Avent or other brands.  We believe it is because Playtex's venting allows him to suck without encountering increasing resistance and needing to break his seal for the bottle to backfill with air.  The Avent do seem like they would look newer longer but looks aren't everything.
I chose these for my first child because my close friend was using them with her daughter and they didn't seem to have any leak problems.  At first, I didn't either.  Not difficult to figure out how to assemble or anything.  No problems.However, I was soon dissapointed... of course, only after I bought more of this brand.After 2-3 weeks the numbers came off the bottles so you had to eye the measurements.My son is still at 6 oz, but if he ever gets 8 oz I don't know how I'm going to easily fill these bottles as the 8 oz line is very close to the nipple despite the 9 oz bottle measurement.The bottles WILL randomly leak.  It's usually at inconvienant times like in the middle of the grocery store or while they are filled with water in your diaper bag.  Considering I found another brand that had a solid bottom that gave my son no issues, that was a serious PITA.I have no clue when he'll ever need the fast flow nipples.  He's a big eater but at 7 mo whenever he tries the fast nipples (or I accidently put them on) he spills milk everywhere.I can't say I didn't get my use out of them but I won't buy these again.
Our baby's been getting fussy.  We started with gas drops and that nipped the problem in the bud.  Then a couple of weeks ago, feeding time turned into a battle zone.  Screaming, back arching, twisting and writhing, spitting formula while passing gas, burps sending formula up along with air.  We were desperate.So I ran out and bought these bottles.The Good:The moment we switched, the screaming stopped.  HOORAY!  We still get a little screaming if we didn't get the bottle assembled properly and we have leaks, and it seems slightly harder to get burps out of baby, probably because there's less air going in so it takes longer to build up a good solid burp.The Bad:These bottles in the 3 pack only come with the stage 2 nipples.  The flow on those was too fast, baby was drowning.  I bought a bunch of stage 1 nipples and WHOA, we went from 125 mL per 30 minutes to 45 mL in an hour.  I tried letting baby build up her sucking strength on these stage 1 nipples for about 3 days, then finally, out of desperation, came here to read reviews and see what others had to say.  I bought the narrow Dr. Brown's Level 1 nipples.  Baby's sucking had evolved by the time I got those home, and unfortunately, she sucks so hard after having used these crummy Playtex stage 1 nipples that she drowns some more when we use the alternative nipples.  This solution would have worked well had I got these nipples the DAY that we noticed how slow the stage 1 Playtex nipples were.  Needless to say, I thoroughly read through the instructions since the screaming had stopped and I was able to process information again.  It recommends that you bring the nipple tip where the hole is closer to where baby's lips come together, meaning, don't allow more than 1/2 the nipple in baby's mouth while she's sucking.  This has worked perfectly and we are now back to 100 mL in 30 minutes. PTL!The Ugly:In addition to needing a stage 1.5 nipple desparately (Come ON Playtex, Puuuuhleeeez!), the parts are a bit awkward.  Not like Dr. Brown's, but you have the nipple, the ring, the bottle, the disk, and the vent cap.  Lots of pieces to clean and keep up with, but easy to handle if they keep your kid from screaming at you for hours on end.  Also, you are not supposed to use a bottle warmer on this.  Guess what, I tried it anyway.  Sometimes a bit of formula will leak thereby requiring cleanout of the bottle warmer.  But it isn't too bad and we have been using the bottle warmer anyway, seems to be working out just fine for us.  Take my advice-ASSEMBLE THE BOTTLES WHILE BABY's SLEEPING, YOU CAN'T SLAP THESE THINGS TOGETHER DURING A SCREAMY BABY EMERGENCY OR YOU WILL HAVE A MESS ON YOUR HANDS (and everywhere else).Bottom line is that our baby is eating again.  So I would recommend, I just take away one star for the bad/ugly portions of my review.Edit:  These bottles WERE a TEMPORARY answer to our prayers.  However, we have switched to Avent bottles and they have worked great for us for two weeks now.  My advice to parents looking for bottles to solve feeding issues-buy the smallest number possible and give it 5 days.  If it looks good on day one and is the same kind of good by day 5, it's safe to sink more money into it.  But if it isn't going to work out, it will be obvious by day 5 or sooner that you haven't found "The Answer".
I brought my newborn daughter home from the hospital yesterday excited to use my new VentAire bottles instead of the little disposable similac bottles that they give you at the hospital.  BIG MISTAKE!  She struggled with the nipples hardly getting anything out of them. I tried both the stage one and two.  I then tried the Evenflo Comfi that we received in out hospital bag.  She loves it and I love it because I don't have to watch my 5 day old baby struggle to eat!  I went to Babies R Us and returned the VentAires that my husband thankfully did not sterilize and bought the Evenflo Comfis.  The VentAire sounded great but I am very disappointed and caution everyone who decides to use them.
I registered for tommy tippee and avent natural bottles thinking they would be the best.  When my son was born and we actually started using them I found that the avent nipple was too fast and milk got trapped in the tommy tippee bottle.  My husband came home with one of these bottles and I was unsure at first due to the smaller nipple size.  Well, my son did great with it, no milk went to waste and the bottles were easy to use.  I have had no complaints what so ever about these bottles.
I was looking for a bottle that vented similar to the Dr. Browns bottle, but not with the straw because they leaked all the time. So I thought I would try these Playtex Ventaire bottles and I have loved them! I like that they vent from the back, no straw is necessary, and I haven't had any problems with these bottles leaking.I read reviews before buying this bottle set and with the advise I read, I just make sure to screw the bottom piece on tight and so far, no leaking at all. I have been using these bottles now for about 2 months.This is the perfect starter kit because it has everything you need and for a great price.The only thing I noticed, which I also read in reviews, was the fast flow nipple was too fast, so I bought separate medium flow nipples and use both slow and medium nipples over the fast flow.
It is true, the vent disk is hard to figure out... but once you know that the plastic bottom and the disk have to be COMPLETLY dry before putting it together, you won't have a problem with leaks. It just takes a little practice - just like everything else with a new baby. Also, it gets very easy to put them together... You want to talk about a lot of parts and hard to put together (not to mention expensive) try the DR Brown's bottles! I couldn't stand to keep her on those long enough to see if it helped with the gas.I also had a problem with the stage 1 nipples... My girl is a big eater and hated how long it took to get formula from those nipples! (of course we were on the avent stage 1 nipples, which will drown the baby) Switched to stage 2 and she was happy. However, I do still use the stage 1 nipples for juice and water... it helps me ensure she isn't getting the thinner liquids too fast - and she does just fine with those.I did have a problem every once in a while with the nipple colapsing to begin with... but for some reason, that went away quickly. Not sure if they are just broken in now, or if she just figured out how to eat from them?I did use a bottle warmer for a while (until I decided I hated that thing)Then I switched to the microwave. And I also use a steam sterilizer with these bottles. I have been doing so for 5 months now, and I don't have any problems - I even know that the disks are still working b/c you can see the air leaving the bottle via the bubbles! So, I think that that is just an overprecautious warning.As for the gas... little megan is VERY gassy and always has been. I tried all kinds of bottles. These seem to be better than the others, but she still gets gas and she is 6 months old now. It dosent seem to be as painfull with these bottles, and that's why I still use them.Give them a try, at least. What works for one, dosent work for everyone. This could be your bottle.
I love the fact that my son takes well to these bottles. Unfortunately, they are such a nightmare to wash and assemble.I don't have a dishwasher, so I have to hand wash each piece. I feel like my life revolves around washing, drying and assembling bottles. My son is gassy. He burps often with them, but he feeds well.Beware of the nipple not tightening properly when you screw it on. Many times I have been sprayed by an improperly fitting nipple. Also, it's near impossible to warm this bottle up if you have cold formula. If you place it in water the bottom collects it, only to pour out when it is inverted.I give them 3 stars for my son...I give them 1 star for myself!
My son is just about 8 months old now and I figured I would jump online and start reviewing some of the products I have used. When I was pregnant, I found the reviews helpful, so I thought I would add to the feedback....We haven't used any other bottles besides these and they seem to work perfectly. My son is on breastmilk and he seemed to burp equally between the natural breast and these bottles. So, I guess not too much air is swallowed. And they withstand the test of time, since I haven't had to buy new ones, they are still in excellent shape 8 months later.
We have tried Medela, Avent, and Playtex. Like these the best because of airflow feature and larger volume.  Our two month old can take 6 oz easily.
We bought this for our son because even when we run the heater in this apartment, the chill settles back on the air as soon as the thing shuts off.  High ceiling are pretty - but not so great for holding heat! At any rate, we don't much like keeping lose blankets in the bed with him and layering the clothes on him only works well until he's in need of a diaper change.  The sleep sack zips up from the bottom which makes diaper changes SO much easier!It's also just heavy enough weight that if you put it on over a long-sleeve onesie and a pair of socks, the baby is perfectly toasty.  The fabric is soft right out of the package, but after a few washings it's just really quite nice. No pilling and no faulty zipper...We'll be buying another one soon, for sure.
I have two of these, and one is perfect... but the other has a sticky zipper that is hard to catch. But, I was in a pinch and couldn't return it, because I needed it.But, the baby loves them. And they do help her to sleep better overall, so I do recommend them.
My son loves his sleep sack. He has been in one since he was just a few months old. I love the softness of the fleece - it keeps him perfectly warm and snuggly. The design is nice and subtle, could be used for a girl too!
Love this sleep sack.  So soft and cozy.  Great for cool nights!  My son appears to love it too, as he is sleeping better now that we have started using sleep sacks.
These sleep sacks are wonderful! My granddaughter used them all winter....and where we're from, it gets very cold at night. She was snug as ever. Not too warm, not cold at all. I would HIGHY reccommend these to new parents. What a wonderful idea someone came up with....sleep with no worries about the blanket covering the infant's head!
We love these sleep sacks. Out little one is now old enough to have a blanket but he moves around so much in his sleep it doesn't stay on, these are perfect especially for the colder months
I really like this sleep sack.  For some reason, she gets really cold at night when she sleeps even though we are in sunny California.  I initially bought her a cotton sleep sack, which just didn't cut it.  This one keeps her much warmer. It's actually a medium weight fleece so I wouldn't really call it micro fleece. I wish there was an option for sleeves since her hands and forearms are still cold at night.
It gets really cold at night, and our doctor has said no blankets in the crib.  Even though my baby can sit up, stand, and crawl, I still would rather be safe.  This sleepsack is very soft and warm.  It gives him enough room that he can still sit and stand while wearing it, yet it doesn't ride up above his neck while he sleeps and moves around.  My only complaint is that the cream doesn't keep in it's original nice color - shows any type of stains (spit up, etc.).
Let me start off by saying I love HALO sleep sacks have used them for a year now with my son. I have nothing against this actual product but more so with how it arrived.I find it difficult to believe that this product was new. The plastic wrapping was broken in places with tape keeping it closed. The sleep sack itself had a leaf, yes a leaf, on it within the packing. For the price of this item I expect that I am getting a brand new item not one that has already been opened.  I don't feel the hassle of returning it and ordering another would really be worthwhile so I threw the item in the wash and will use it once it's dry.So in a nutshell, like the product wish I received one that hadn't previously been opened previously.
True to size, we're happy with the quality and the sizing. And, it's easy to put on and take off!
I like this product but I don't love it.  It is soft, cozy and warm.  It is obviously safer than blanket in the crib but I have only washed it two or three times and the fleece is already starting to really pill.
I have loved these for keeping my babies warm without having to worry about suffocation with a blanket or anything.  I've used these with all 3 of my kiddos.  I could never find a size above a small for my first two kids, but I was glad to find these online in medium and large for my 3rd baby.  I have to say that the size chart should really go by height rather than weight, though.  My son has outgrown his size small but looking at the sizing chart, I suspected he was getting close in weight to the large size range, and having never found them in store, I had no idea how large it would be. So I just bought a large instead of a medium so he wouldn't outgrow that in a month. Well, the large is massive, haha.  My 3-year-old who is around 39" tall could easily wear this if she wasn't going to get out of bed and have to run to the potty quick or something, lol. So I have tried my son in the large anyway, and it doesn't seem to ride up over his face or anything.
We love these sleepsacks and intend to use them until our son outgrows all the sizes.  It is great to know that he at least will have the sleepsack on after he kicks off everything else during the night.  Our house is kept at cooler temps., so we use this each night over our pjs, except in the summer months. The large was a good choice for our 16 month old, too.  I am very happy with the product!
I decided to buy this because swaddling wasn't working anymore. I wanted the sack over the swaddler because I wanted my little guy to have his arms free. It's perfect for bedtime. I don't have to worry about baby kicking off his blanket.
I love Halo Sleep Sacks and use this one every night for my 5 month old. I plan to switch to the cotton version once the weather gets warmer. I do lay a blanket over her because she likes to rub the furry material to fall asleep, but I like that the sleep sack keeps her legs enclosed so she cant get a leg caught in the crib railings. The halo brand sleep sack is better then all the other brands out there, Ive tried them all and prefer HALO to them all!
I have several Halo products. I have never been disappointed by the durable zipper and fabrics. The fleece bags are cozy for the winter and great for children transitioning from swaddle to blankets. They can't kick them off and so won't wake up cold. The inverted zipper makes late night diaper changes a breeze.
We have used a series of SleepSacks for my daughter since the day she was born, starting with the ones with the swaddling "wings" and graduating on as she grew. We love how these work, the zipper ends at the bottom when zipped so its not near her face, and is nearer the "bottom end" for night time changing. These are the heavier feeling polyester ones, we prefer these during the winter when sometimes the house gets a wee bit cooler. The durability is very nice on them we haven't had any have any problems with zipper misalignment, tears, etc. Also since the baby stays in them unlike a blanket, night time feedings or comforting when baby can't sleep can be done very simply by picking the baby up and she stays nice warm and cozy without getting woken up more and fussy.I heartily recommend these to anyone with a baby or small toddler.
Those little legs can get chilly in a onesie, so he likes to wear his sleep sack for lounging around. He can play on his play mat and do tummy time with this on, still kicks his legs with no problem. When I unzip it to change his diaper his legs are always nice and toasty warm. Obviously great for sleeping too.
These sleep sacks are just fantastic. So far, i have had them in every size from newborn - x-large, and I simply couldn't imagine not having them. the fleece sacks are soft, especially after you wash it. I throw them in the wash about every 4 days and they wash up great each time. in the warmer months, i've used the cotton ones, and they are equivalent to a thin blanket (because it really traps in body heat). with doctors pushing SIDS precautions all the way up until 1 year old, i can't imagine ever not having these sacks. A+.
We always have our room temperature at 67 for the night. We worry that our 5 month old will kick off the blanket, so we got this based on the good reviews. My baby's hands are freezing cold after a night in this. Hers were always warm with a blanket. I guess it is because the arms are all exposed? I have to say that I prefer a blanket based on this one night's data.
My daughter is now 12 weeks and we have been using the Sleepsack for probably a month or so.  My husband and I were swaddling our daughter with a blanket but she was getting her hands out and sometimes kicking her feet out.  The Sleepsack is great because it zips to make sure the feet stay in and you have the option of swaddling with arms in or out.  Our daughter liked being swaddled and slept better in the Sleepsack so I would absolutely recommend it.
These are wonderful! My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms.While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe.I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow.I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one.Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby.We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally.We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one.
I purchases this for our baby who is arriving in February.  I can't wait to see the tyke wear it!  It is very soft.
my daughter is 16 pounds and 26 ounces - 4 mo. and she has plenty of room to grow.  she loves them too!
We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics.  They are all terrific.  We're using the fleece at night in the winter, the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall.  I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets!
easy to use as a blanket.  I put my kids in it and put them right to bed.  I am happy I do not have to deal with sheets.
Like the fact that the zipper zips from the bottom up. Very convenient when you want to change diapers and don't want to completely undress the kid. sleeveless good for the not so cold nites...
Our baby is 8 months old and we've been using Halo Sleepsacks since we stopped swaddling her. They are great - they keep baby warm and make middle-of-the-night diaper changes very easy. The barnyard design is cute too.
I bought the halo sleep sacks because they were heavily recommended to me by doctors and friends.  I love it because not only does it keep my baby cozy warm and safe, but it is super convenient for me.My son goes in the sleep sack with a onsie on.  This makes diaper changes a breeze in the middle of the night.  Baby stays nice and sleepy which makes it easier to go back to bed.They also hold up nice in the wash. Love the halo sleep sack.
My son, who is now 15 months old, has been in these for at least a year. They keep him warm and cozy as he tosses and turns all night long. We have two and rotate them so he wears one at every nap and every night in the cooler winter months. My son is somehow able to walk in these so no need for the &#34;early walker&#34; version for us :)
i had a very tall baby so i bought an extra large size, he fit in it with planty of room to grow, i would recommend it to anybody looking for a wearable blanket to keep your baby nice and warm .
Light, breathable blanket. I like it better than the smaller one that secures baby's arms with Velcro. I only wish the zipper was NOT starting on top. This totally sucks, because you have to connect it every time instead of just sliding up if it was sewn to the bottom.
I have no idea what I can review about it, except that my 8 month old daughter is sleeping very well in it and no complains from my wife about the way is made and washed.My daughter is using it for 1.5 month now and we toughed mainly for winter time.
I bought two of these in different colors for my daughter, and they are awesome. I was originally using regular blankets, but she would almost always kick them off and she is still too young to know how to cover herself up again (she's almost 7 months now). That problem was very easily resolved with these!
These sleep sacks are the best. Keeps my baby warm at night and I don't have to worry about keeping a blanket in the crib with him.
I absolutely love HALO sleep sacks! I had these with both kids and was so happy that they still made this with my youngest! They zip from the top to the bottom so you don't have to worry about your child playing with them when they are going to sleep or just waking up. Very warm, easy to wash, doesn't get pilly stays soft! These are a no brainer over blankets!
My daughter lived in these between 3 and 8 months. They're great for when your baby no longer wants to be swaddled but still needs extra warmth without the bulk of blankets.
This is way bigger than I anticipated, but it's perfect for putting over top of pajamas to keep little one warm without using blankets.
I personally think these sleep sacks are great.  I bought this one for my sister-in-law who is expecting their third child.  I have two of these for my daughter.  She sleeps very comfortably in them.  I do not worry that she will get tangled in her blanket.  I do not worry that she will kick her covers off and catch a chill.  also, as an added benefit, the sack has extended our time in the crib.  My daughter is not yet ready for a toddler bed, from which she could wander at night while we are sleeping.  However, my daughter has reached the stage where most children begin to hoist themselves over the sides of their cribs.  The sack has prevented her from being able to get her legs over the sides of her crib and therefore is probably the only thing keeping us from having to move her to a toddler bed at this time.Drawbacks I see are few, but:  I do wish there was some sort of locking mechanism on the zipper, as I see that she is now beginning to fiddle with it and will undoubtedly soon unravel the mystery.  At that point, I believe she will start unzipping the thing and begin coming out of it when I am not watching her.  Also, I have had some difficulty choosing the correct size sack for her.  For example, I recently purchased the new sack that has holes for the feet to fit through, as she is now walking. I chose to purchase the new sack because I am concerned that she will try to walk around her crib in the old sack and trip. I realized, of course, that in a sack with holes for her feet she would then be able to crawl out of the crib, but I am so pleased with these that I decided to keep going with them rather than move to a blanket.  I bought the  "Large Size"  which is the same size she is now wearing, but the product was too long.  I am still waiting for her to grow into it.  Admittedly, my daughter is short for her age and so perhaps this is not a problem many others would encounter.  Lastly, the sacks are a little expensive.Overall, I would recommend them.  Peace of mind has been my greatest reward in using them.  Before I began using these I was constantly up in the night checking to make sure she was not too hot or too cold.  If I dressed her warmly for bed (winter gown and socks) I usually found she was too hot, even sweating.  That can be as dangerous as having a blanket wrapped around the head.  If I took some of the clothing off, I felt she was too cool.  Adjusting the temperature in the room never seemed to solve the problem either.  And of course, if I did resort to a blanket, she invariably ended up either kicking the thing off or worse, she ended up with it over her face.  These sacks have eliminated all of these problems and even aided in other areas I had not foreseen.  I highly recommend them.
This is great! I used it when we stopped swaddling our son. It's so soft and cozy. It washed nicely and didn't get nappy like some fleece material will. I love it. I saved it for my next baby.
I recently got this and it had a very strong mothball smell. Washed it twice, soaked it in oxyclean and still couldn't get the odor out. Returned it.
I like the sleepsack a lot.  It's very warm and very roomy.  The neckline is a little too high though, it seems to choke him a bit when he moves around in his crib.  It also runs a big large too.
I can not recommend the SleepSack highly enough.  I am sure that there is a, &#34;How to raise a perfect child&#34; book out there showing how sleep sacks stunt development and prevents self soothing - but from a mom who has a pretty great kid in spite of every mistake I've made - I'm sticking with the sleep sack.On warm nights - we put her in a long sleeve shirt and the sack and put her in bed.  She sleeps soundly and has NO problem maneuvering in the crib or even running around.On cold nights, she gets a fuzzy sleep garment on and then the sleep sack and again, she sleeps like a log.Its also a great way to let your little one know that it is time for bed.  We only put her in it if she will be sleeping in less than an hour.  She seems to know what the sleep sack means and often will take it and put it next to her crib if she finds it in the laundry.
My grandson is a year old this fit perfectly. He has one that is made of heavier material but this one is good for a backup. We live in extreme cold weather. Its well made but not as thick as some.
Very soft! stayed soft after washing.  A little bigger than I was expecting.  My 6 month old is in the 75%ile and she swims in the medium! But the Small still fits her perfect so I may wait awhile to have her wear this one.
Safety first!  But no need to sacrifice comfort for safety with the HALO sleepsack!  Our 6-month old daughter loves the blanket and it's heavy enough for her to know it's there but light enough that she isn't sweating underneath.  We don't put pajama bottoms on her and I highly recommend the Leveret long-sleeve onesies to go with any sleepsack.
This is a really good wearable blanket. We are going through a transition phase trying to move baby into the crib, and every time we lay her down she wakes up within half an hour.  We just got it yesterday, and for the first time my 3 month old slept through the night with this on! Here's what we like about the blanket:- The material is very soft and plush and not too thick.- There is a nice little embroidered emblem that says &#34;Back is Best&#34; to remind parents to put the child on their back at sleep time.- It has an inverted zipper that zips from the bottom-up, which really makes changing diapers in the middle of the night easy.- The A-line shape makes it very roomy and comfortable for the child to move their legs.- Arm holes prevent baby from getting too warm.- The colors are as just as displayed in the picture, very light and pastel.We got the medium size which fits babies 6 months and up and though its a bit lengthy for our baby at this age (she is 24 inches), I prefer the extra room to kick her legs and not feel confined. If your baby is having trouble sleeping through the night, try this out, the warmth and snuggly feeling of this blanket will make them sleep in comfort.
I've owned the medium, large and now extra large version of this blanket.  Excellent product.  I haven't had any problems with the zipper or other components.These blankets tend to be on the large size because they cover a range of about 10 lbs of weight (26 to 36 lbs., for instance).  Some people seem to have experienced problems with that.  Definitely pay attention to the sizing and expect a larger blanket.  Don't worry; babies grow into them.  A little extra room is good for a growing child.
This wearable blanket is great!  In response to other comments, the sleepsack did cover my son's mouth and nose a sometimes but it was because I put him in one too large.  The smaller one was fantastic and he grew into the other one.  Also, these are "blankets" not pajamas.  At night I put my son in long sleeved, long pants pjs and he does just fine.  I like that it has no sleeves for during the day and in hot weather where I let him wear short sleeves when sleeping.  I like knowing he is always covered and I don't have to worry.  It also helps keep his feet/legs from getting stuck in the crib slats.  This is a great product.
Good price and a warm blanket for my son.  What more do you need?  My son hasn't wiggled out of it and it's super warm.  I would definitely purchase another.
I think the sleep sac is a wonderful invention. I get peace of mind and my daughter stays warm all night. I don't have to worry if she kicked off her blanket and is cold, I don't worry about a blanket getting wrapped around her face. All in all I feel really great about the Halo SleepSack. Another plus is that it arrived before I expected!
Since you are not supposed to use blankets in the crib,  I love these SleepSacks.  They are the 3rd layer I put on him at night and he stays warm and toasty and safe.  I have to say the picture doesn't do this design justice.  Once I got it, was when I realized how cute this print really is.  Washed it before first use, it was super soft and had no issues with anything come apartment or threads coming out.  (I am still using the ones I bought in 2008 so these are super durable!)
This was way better than I expected for the money.  Very soft and quite 'heavy'.  I would have no issue at all putting my grandchild in this to sleep without any additional coverings at all.  Very very soft and lots of room for him to kick his legs.  Love it.
Both my children slept in Halo SleepSacks as babies. I started them out swaddled (the SwaddleMe was my favorite), and the SleepSack seemed to make the transition from the swaddler easier. I keep my kids in SleepSacks until they were able to keep blankets on them at night (18 months of age, or so). My tall (75th percentile) 18 month old still has plenty of room in a large (medium is a tad short at this point).Both my kids got to the point that a Sleepsack was part of bedtime (and naptime) routine. My youngest will go and find his Sleepsack and bring it to me when he gets tired.We live in a cold climate (MT), and my kids sleep in a cold basement. I do a onesie, footie jamies, and a SleepSack during the winter. This seems about right (not freezing, but not overheating either).Make sure to get at least two (in case of middle of the night leaks). I've had problems with some of my SleepSacks pilling due to overly aggressive washing. Not a huge problem, but does make them less soft and comfy. But, I haven't had a problem now that I make a point to be more careful (cold water, no unnecessary washings, etc.).
This is our 3rd one of these--provide excellent safe warm for sleeping babies and toddlers.  Our daughter is 16 months and still sleeping in one!  Hold up well, good zipper.  Right length.  Can't say enough good things.
My daughter sleeps in this thing every single night. It's perfect. Comfy and not too hot and her legs can move around as much as she wants. We graduated to this one from the halo swaddleme sleep sack and she'll be sleeping in these things for months to come. LOVE this product.
I worry about my twins being cold since you are not suppose to use a blanket in their cribs. This product gives me piece of mind that my twins will not be cold.
I have purchased these for both of my kids in various sizes and love them!  It's so nice to know they always have a blanket on them while they sleep.  Halo makes a great sack at a reasonable price.  Don't waste your money buying others that aren't any better for triple the money.
Purchased to keep my granddaughter warm at night in her crib and it does the job. These days people frown on using blankets for little ones so these do the trick.
this is the second sleep sack we've purchased  for our 15 mo.  old.  we love the product it is safe for her to be covered without any far of her wrapping her head in the blanket ( which happened once prior to our first sleep sack)  and now that she is older it even helps prevent her from climbing out of her crib.  We have already purchased the newborn and small also sacks for our expected arrival.  I recommend this product to anyone who will listen.
The zipper goes down (easy to change a diaper w/o removing it). The fleece is soft and holds up to multiple washings, wearings ( I have several that have been worn by 4 kids before mine and they still work).
These fleece sleepsacks are the absolute best solution for a baby or toddler. We've owned them in every size since my daughter was a newborn... when she outgrows one size, I order the next. When she was an infant, I felt more comfortable knowing she wouldn't get entangled in a loose blanket, and she'd stay covered and warm all night. Now that she's a toddler, she still moves around in her crib throughout the night, and there's no way she'd stay covered by a loose blanket. I'm sure I will continue buying these until she's old enough to move into a big kid bed and use a comforter.
The halo sleepsack works well but there are two things to consider. It runs larger than the summer brand and unlike the summer brand it only zips from top to bottom. The Summer brand has two zippers so you can zip both ways. Otherwise it is a great purchase since for the baby's safety you shouldn't put loose blankets in the crib. Better yet, no cold feet  b/c little one can't kick off the covers. Get 2, just so you have an extra for those middle of the night diaper accidents. Also it's helpful to have one in regular cotton and one in fleece so you can make sure baby isn't too hot depending on the night and the thickness of the pjs underneath.
Keeps baby warm, but not too hot, puts a limit on nighttime crawling around (and waking up) in crib, very durable.
We have used this pretty much every night with my son since he was 4 months old or so (he is now almost 9 months old). The zipper works very well, and is smooth. I put him in it after his bath just before he nurses to sleep. It keeps his feet warm, especially since he kicks the blanket off. I wish this came with long sleeves because I worry that his arms may be cold. Great product. It's withstood several hot washes in the washing machine too (and dryer).
This is a great product, really. I actually tried to make one of these myself recently since it is such a genius idea. The sizing however, is WAY too big. I bought the XL for my son (who usually wears size 24m in clothing) and it is truly Extra-Large. Even so, he wears it at bedtime and is able to stand in his crib without tripping over himself in the morning. I suppose I should be happy that it is big and he will grow into it.... But if you want a nice comfortable fit (still with room to move around) , you should probably order a size down.The product itself looks exactly how it appears on amazon. It has really given me peace of mind at bedtime, since my son loves to roll around and uncover himself all night... I think this is a necessity for babies 3+ months (particularly if you live somewhere not so warm)...
This is one of our favorite sleep sacks. The length is perfect for a growing 5-6 month old baby who likes to roll without being too big in the arms. The weight of the fabric is perfect. Even though we live in a warm climate, we run our air low at night. With a long sleeve onesie, this sleep sack is the perfect &#34;safe&#34; blanket for baby at night. I only wish HALO would do a double zipper.
Both of my kids started wearing sleep sacks every night once they were out of swaddle blankets. My 3 yr old stopped wearing them when she was in her twos. My other just turned two and is still in them. I love that I don't have to worry about them being cold at night.
The halo wraps are soft and comfortable for my daughter. We still use them at 16 months. Safer than a blanket. We just bought the XL as our daughter is tall. She is 32 1/2 inches and this allows her some kicking room.
I love the idea of the Sleepsack.  We use it every night. Before we had this in medium, we had a small on in another brand that doesn't make them anymore.  The other one had a piece of material on the inside that you secured by velcro around the baby.  My baby is a mover and loves to kick her feet in her crib.  We lay her one way in her crib at night and she ends up sideways by morning.  As a first time mother, the material in the other one gave me peace of mind that the sleepsack wasn't going to come up over her nose and mouth.  I just wish this one had that material in the middle too.
The Micro-Fleece wearable blanket is perfect for spring and fall.  We are just transitioning from carter's sleep sacks with sleeves to these as the weather is getting a bit warmer.  They are keeping my little guy very comfortable through the night right now . . . I highly recommend.
My baby loves his sleepsack.  He liked being swaddled for about the first month, but after that he wanted the comfort of a blanket but also to have his arms free.  He seems to like the feeling of the fleece and sleeps with it bunched in his hands.  It can be a little too warm for his naps during the summer, so I had to buy a lighter cotton one for hotter days.  But I bought one of these in every size so that he can keep using it as he gets bigger.
Although our boys could technically sleep with blankets now, we still use the sleep sacks because they stay on and keep them warm overnight. Also, I am terrified they're going togain access to their diapers (have a friend whose child did this, and painted the room with its contents), and this is one more barrier to prevent them from doing so.  Just love these things. :)
If your baby is anything like mine and does not like to be swaddled, this sleep sack is the perfect alternative.It is thick enough to keep baby warm, but not so warm that baby over-heats. It is very soft and does not scratch baby's skin. The zipper works top down so that baby cannot open the zipper himself and makes for very convenient diaper changes.It doesn't bunch up around baby's neck either, so you can rest assured that baby is safe at night.
These sleeps sacks are very large though my son is in the middle of the recommended weight and at the end of the height range
does what it's supposed to do. i only wish it had sleeves so that baby wouldn't have to wear pjs underneath... overall tho, it keeps him warm and cozy.
The Boppy was recommended by a friend. It was also recommended in a breastfeeding class that I took. I got this before my baby was born. Didn't take it to the hospital & my arms were killing me from holding my little baby-regular pillows didn't help. When we got home I used the Boppy-what a difference! It gives me the freedom to do other things while feeding the baby. It's also great for propping the baby up in a sitting position (supervised). Hope this review helps!
This pillow was a wonderful help during my breastfeeding time and helped prevent the back pain that comes with that slouched position you get into while trying to keep the baby comfortable.  Now that I have stopped breastfeeding my baby loves being propped up in this pillow so he can sit on his own and look around the room at everyone.
Another MUST HAVE I was told. I think not. Pillows are much more effective in my opinion to prop up the baby while nursing. The boppy just wasn't comfortable for me, it was too stiff. I didn't feel like it really fit me - and I am not a big woman - size 8 before pregnancy, size 10-12 while nursing. I really think it is overrated and not necessary.I have heard good things about "my breast friend" I might try that one next time. But still felt like the pillows did the trick.
We just had a new baby boy and I feel like a new mother! My older son is now 14 years old and boy have baby products changed since then! I seriously considered comments and reviews when deciding which items I wanted, which I could live without, and what was an absolute must have. So I hope you find my review just as helpful when deciding on your purchase. I LOVE THE BOPPY! At first my husband thought to was a joke, well until he used it for the first time.  Now he won't feed without it!  It allows your baby to lay in a comfortable position and makes mommy very comfortable while feeding too! It gives the perfect support for your arm and babys back.  This is definitely one of our favorite purchases!
The best tip that I got when I was pregnant was to get a Boppy.  Then, if you have a vaginal birth... SIT ON IT!  Sure enough, I did and I did!  It was so much better than the pillow that the hospital gave me for the same purpose.Yes, it is also good for feeding the baby.  And it is wonderful when baby is three months or so and wants to be propped up a bit to see that ever-expanding world.
Not only does it make holding and feeding your baby easier, but it also good for proping her up on the couch or floor. My 3 month old daughter loves to sit in it on the couch or on the floor and play with her toys or just look around.
We have used our Boppy for 3 mo's.  We don't breastfeed but we still find Boppy to be indispensible.  When Isaiah was born, Daddy made a special trip home just to get our Boppy for us to use at the hospital.  Everyone loved bottle feeding with it.  It has just the right smooshiness for supporting Baby and helps old Mommies and Daddies like us avoid those numb arms and crimped necks.  We enjoy it for tummy time and sitting practice, too.  During pregnancy, it was a mystery to us when friends told us to register for a Boppy and it seemed expensive but, once Isaiah arrived, we learned very quickly that a Boppy is worth every penny.  Other friends have tried the Boppy competitors and not been satisfied.  It's hard to believe that the smooshiness, shape, size, fabric type, etc. are so critical but, when you feed a baby round the clock, they are, and Boppy has them mastered.
This pillow was originally created as something that would allow babies to sit up on their own to provide a soft surface around their back and sides in case they fall over. It was a marketing device to sell these as nursing pillows. The midwives and nursing consultants I've all spoken with hate this pillow for nursing. Unfortunately I thought this would make a great nursing pillow and so bought it before my baby was born and have wished ever since that I bought a real nursing pillow. What I ended up doing was putting this on my lap even though it comes too far around my back and so leaves a space between myself and my baby which she regularly falls into and then putting a second regular bed pillow on top so that she doesn't roll around. Because the boppy is round my baby is very unstable on my lap without another pillow on top, it also doesn't lift her up high enough without a second pillow. For a long time I only used two bed pillows and that was enough, so if you can't afford a real nursing pillow you can just use a couple bed pillows.When using this to sit up please know that it cause physical problems for a baby if they sit up a lot before they can get up on their own. So please be careful that you don't use this too much with your baby before they can get up on their own. I never used this for my baby during tummy time. I found she has gotten moving very quickly by just putting her belly down. She didn't like it at first, but I'd just pick her up when she started fussing (even if it was just a few moments) and over the months she has liked it more and more and can now spend up to an hour on her tummy going all over the living room (she is six months old). So I really haven't found much use for it except for forcing myself to use it as a nursing pillow since I don't want to spend the money on a good one. Just know that it may frustrate you if you try to use it for nursing.I gave it four stars because it works great for what it was originally designed for - to protect your sitting baby in case he/she falls over, but they advertise it as a nuring pillow which it was not well designed for.
Excellent product.  It makes nursing so much easier!!  I suggest bringing it to the hospital.  I wish I had.  I will for the next one.  Helps keep mom comfy during long nursing sessions.  Can also be used to help prop baby up when they begin to learn to sit or for them to lay in when they are little.  Great gift idea.
I registered for the Boppy because everyone said it was a "Must Have". I am breastfeeding my baby and I do not think it is a "Must Have" but it is nice to have - just not for breastfeeding.I tried using it for breastfeeding and found that there are other pillows out there that work better. The reasons are:1) It is designed to fit around your waist but it keeps sliping out on my lap.2) The top is curved and the baby can easily roll off the Boppy, especially as he gets bigger.I later purchased a Tresor breastfeeding pillow that was recommended by a lactation consultant and found it much more useful. It comes with a buckle that can be attached around your waist so it stays put on your lap. Also it is much larger and flat accros the top. I do not feel like the baby is going to roll off the pillow, which is nice when you are trying to undo a nursing bra or grab a burp cloth.I do love the Boppy for other reasons. I have used it as a "nest" for my napping baby. He is now 8 weeks old and frequently I put him in the Boppy to curl up while I am doing other things. He seems really comfortable and stays put. I'm sure as he gets older we will use it more for sitting up and tummy time.The fleece cover is nice and seems to stay clean. It has washed well a couple of times. However the extra covers that we purchased came apart in the laundry.I recommend getting the Boppy for other reasons than for breastfeeding.
I am so pleased with my boppy; my son and I have used it every day and night for the past 12 weeks (since day one). Breast feeding did not come easily to us, but having this pillow made it much easier. I didn't have to worry about supporting his weight while we figured it out - I only had to manage his head. After all, it took a while for me to build up my arm muscles in the beginning (he is a big baby!). If you get one, take it to the hospital with you!! I met with a lactation consultant who not only recommended that I get a bobby, her office was full of them.Other things I like:- The boppy puts him at the right level and I don't have to bend over.- Now that we both know what we're doing, I can even sit at the computer and have both hands free while he feeds!- It seems to be very comfortable for my son. He will sometimes fall fast asleep after a meal and has stayed there cuddled up to me for a long time.- I have machine washed and dried both the bobby and the cover and it has come out very nicely.- My husband also uses it (although it is a tight fit around his waist) for bottle feedings, since it brings the baby up nice and close comfortably.- It is also a comfy way to prop up my son so that he can see a bit of what's going on.What I'd change:- The fleece cover is quite warm, especially in the summer.- It doesn't really fit within the arms of the rocking chair that we have. I feed him mostly in our bed or on the sofa, so this hasn't really been an issue for us, but if you plan on mostly using this in a glider rocker (or any chair with arms) you may want to try it out first.
I purchased the regular Boppy first. I misunderstood the description and thought it had a removable cover which it doesn't.  It is washable but you put the whole pillow in the washer/dryer. The directions say to dry it with a green tennis ball (strange). I decided to return it and get the Boppy Luxe which does have a removable cover. I like the fabric much better too. It is soft and warm whereas the regular Boppy material is more scratchy.Although I haven't used this product as much as I thought I would, when I have used it it's been great. It's good to remember to use it for those long, sleepy nursing sessions in the evenings. Keep a book by you...I've found I can nurse and read at the same during these long dozzy sessions. Since she's been 3 months old I have occassionally put her in it like a little seat and play with her. She likes this for short periods.
My mother's a lactation consultant and bought this for me.  I was having major problems breastfeeding and this was wonderful.  My daughter and I had to use the football hold for the first two months or so and this was an absolute lifesaver.  Now that she's bigger and we've advanced to the traditional breastfeeding position, we don't use it for nursing.  But it's great to prop her in and let her see what's going on.  It's a nice alternative to her swing.  And the fleece cover is so soft and comfy.  As a sign that she'd outgrown her diapers, one of her poops leaked out onto the cover and the pillow.  Both the cover and the pillow washed great in the washer & dryer.  The Boppy is great!
We registered for this item before baby arrived, and thank God someone purchased it for us! In the hospital we had problems with breastfeeding on day 1, day 2 my husband returned with the Boppy Luxe in hand and it has been smooth sailing ever since. When I am sitting our daughter is comfortable, content, and at the perfect height to feed. My husband uses the Boppy when he is cradling her in his arms for extra support. Our daughter if given the chance falls right to sleep in the softness of this product. Other Boppy pillows are cheaper in price, however one of the features all three of us enjoy that is unique to this one is the fleece covering. I would have given five stars, except for the fact that the fit on my waist is not always comfortable in every seating situation. Great product though!
I got this from our shower and even though I never nursed, I still found this boppy very helpful.  After holding a baby for so long, your arm gets numb so I used this pillow to just hold my baby and still rest my arms.  I also use this pillow for tummy time.  My baby hates laying flat on his belly so I plop him on this belly down so he could still work out his neck muscles.  I've also used this as a prop to hold my baby up to take picturs.  It's great, even if you're not nursing!
I have tried both, the Boppy pillow and My Brest Friend.  For breast-feeding newborn babies I think that My Brest Friend is a lot more comfortable to wear.  Also, it fits better around you when you seat in a glider or rocking chair.  But the Boppy also gets the job done.The reason I think the Boppy is a must have is because you will be using it a lot when your baby starts tummy-time and it is also great for when they are almost sitting down by themselves.  It provides the support they need, while allowing for some independence.  I have two of them and find myself using them all the time.
Even though I ended up bottle feeding, I did try breastfeeding while using this pillow.  I am not a huge person, but a little larger than average, and this pillow just DID NOT work for me.  I tried it every which way I could, and no such luck.My son enjoys it as much as a 3.5 month old can.  Even though it clearly tags the product to not use for a sleeping infant, it saved me at times when his reflux was especially bad.If you are a size 14+ you will want to look into a pillow that will fit you better, because most likely, this one will not be as helpful as it is for smaller women.
This pillow is great for nursing, and it saves your back.  Also, my son loves to lay on his tummy and push up on his back legs.  The pattern is adorable, and the material is VERY soft, but it does get pretty hot.  My son was being bottlefed by my mother while on this pillow, and when I picked him up, he was sweating on his back.  He wasn't even there that long.  I just learned to put a blanket inbetween him and the pillow that wouldn't pass heat through.  Although I don't like the fact that the fabric is hot, I do love the Boppy pillow.  You can also buy covers.  It's definitely something all new moms need!
This is the greatest thing that you can get!  I breastfeed my baby with it every time, unless we're out somewhere.  She loves it.  It supports her, so she's comfy while she eats.  What could be better than laying your head on a pillow to eat?  She doesn't like it when we don't have it with us and she has to lay on my boney arm!  Plus, your hands are free when you don't have to hold them.  I've eaten over my daughter many evenings!  She's 4 months old and we still use it. It is also good to help them sit up later.  This is definitely worth the money.  This one is good because you can wash the cover, which I've had to do.  You can't help but get milk on it sometimes...or spit up.  A BIG must have for moms!
I have this pillow and a washable cover for it. I love it! I have used it from birth up and my boy is 4 months now still using it. He used it at first for breast feeding, by wrapping it around my tummy. It was a relief for me and cushy for the baby. Then (if you can picture this) we used it as a "C-Clamp" for the baby at night. We would lay him on his side to sleep, and then place the boppy around him from his feet. That way it kept his feet warm and served as a position stabilizer keeping him on his side with one end of the pillow touching his back and the other touching his tummy.We used it as a lounge to lean him in as a newborn. And now we are using it as a chair to help stabilize him sitting up. It seems like there is nothing this pillow won't do. Give it a week and we will think of a new use for it. I am VERY glad that I got his pillow.
I received the boppy pillow as a shower gift and it is wonderful. It allows me to nurse my newborn comfortably. The support is great.  I also use this pillow for tummy time with my newborn.
I love the Bobby. What a wonderful idea. At first I didn't use it, until my back started hurting so bad from the strain of leaning over to feed that I could not sleep. Finally my husband reminded me that about the Bobby that I got from my baby shower. One day using the Bobby and my back has not hurt since! We use it to prop our baby up and play with him, we use it for feeding him, my husband uses it everytime he holds our son when sitting down. I have two Bobbys and I can't stress enough how wonderful they are... especially for large breasted women. The Bobby is our most used baby product besides our sons crib and changing table and Ocean Wonders Aquarium Swing.
This is great for my teething 6 month old. She drags it around with her and chews on it instead of her clothes like she was.
I was looking for something that my baby could hold and snuggle and I could attach my own paci of choice to, this seemed to be a great idea however the product itself is lacking. The pacifier attachment is difficult, you can't easily remove the paci to clean, I'm actually afraid I'd break the elastic if I tried it again. I also liked the idea of a silky side but it looks terrible. I washed it on gentle and let it air dry before giving it to my baby and all the silk starting unraveling then so I trimmed those threads. After my baby has grabbed at it for a day its all snagged. I give it two stars bc its a great idea but the materials used are so poor I doubt it will last more than a week more.
Knowing how much babies chew while teething, we recently bought the Munchkin Teething Blanket as a present for our 5 month old grandson.  He took to it right away, it was soon thoroughly covered in baby drool! It was the perfect size to lay across his tummy while he was chewing, perfect for a cold winter while traveling back home. Our grandson seemed to give his teething blanket 5 stars.
My daughter started teething at 3 months and we had great difficulty finding a teether that she liked. After trying the ring and the hand, we fell upon the teething blanket. BEST EVER! It's soft and fuzzy and silky/satiny with 2 chewy corners. She loves grabbing the blankie and chewing on the ends. IT ROCKS!!
First of all, please be aware that the blanket you will receive is on the picture posted by Janet. (Yellow)-2 textured teething surfaces on corners; yellow and green-Super soft push on one side and silky cool satin on the other (I uploaded a picture of the silky cool satin side)-1 pacifier attachment-Full size: 11" x 13.75"My son loves this blanket and I am glad to be able to wash it and put it in the dryer!
my daughter just love teething blanket i'm trying to buy her different kinds... this one serves its purpose. i received neither one in the photos... i got a green teething blanket embroidered with one bee and yes only two teething corners. it really varies in color and design but it doesn't matter as long as my 6 mo. old daughter appreciates what i get for her.
My 6 month old daughter loves to play in this.  We first put her in it when she was around 4 months, and we had to do most of the work.  Half of the fun for her has been figuring out new things and how to make the lights work, the drums go and use all of the other toys.  After reading some of the other reviews, I'd like to add we have not had any of the problems mentioned, and would highly recommend this product.  It seems very safe and my daughter loves it.
I received this as a gift, and although my youngest hasn't used it yet (she's only 2 1/2 months) my older daughter 2 1/2 years plays with it all the time and she has so much fun making music and singing into the mic!  The music it plays and the tones of the keys are not annoying at all... catchy even!  I wish they would have had this when she was a baby... I'm sure our little one will love it too (she already smiles and gets excited when her big sister plays with it)!  It is very bright and stimulating and will last through several phases of development!  I even find myself getting in on the action!  A great way to play with even the youngest of kids!
This was a great addtion to our daughter's toy stash.I originally purchased it after having owned an exersaucer and not liking the constant spinning circles and sometimes hard for baby to reach/press/etc. . . toys. I am so glad I did.From day one, my daughter has loved this toy. I first put her in around 10 months. She loved the sound of the musci below her as she walked back and forth. That gave her a great since of accomplishment.I would keep it in my room for when I needed to work on the computer or take a shower, and I never heard her complain or fuss to get out. . .in fact. . . there were times she would cry BECAUSE she was getting out.This toy has truely &quot;grown&quot; with my child. She is not 18 months and still loves to play &quot;band&quot; with her older brother.THANK YOU FISHER PRICE!
I was offended at the sight of this toy at first.  Then I realized that my son would love it.  It really is not as obnoxious as it seems.  It is not even that loud.  It's worth it.  My son loves it and it keeps him entertained for a long time - much longer than a regular saucer.My eight month old hits himself in the face with most of his toys and this has not been a problem with the step and play.  It is possible with the two toys on the end, but I haven't seen them do damage yet.  They don't seem much different than toys on any other saucer, walker, etc...
So far these are the only pads that don't stick to me, so I love them. I am a B or C cup, and didn't leak often. I also didn't bother with the stickers, they stayed just fine within my nursing bras without the sticker. They do get a little stinky though....
How could anyone breastfeed without these?  The non-disposable cotton pads get wet and stay wet... much like I'd imagine a cloth diaper would feel!  Yuck.  These disposable ones are great... they are like a maxipad for your breasts!  I have a plentiful milk supply (to say the least) and I couldn't imagine life without these pads.  Get them BEFORE you have your baby so you have them handy when your milk comes in.  You'll be glad you did!
TERRIBLE! These pads make already sensitive nipples itch like crazy! And the pleats make them very bulky in your bra.  Plus, there is only one weak adhesive strip, so they slide all over the place. Bad bad bad.  The Lansinoh pads are the best, no question.
I've always used Lansinoh nursing pads, but decided to try these, since they were half as expensive. I found out there's a reason they're half as expensive. They're incredibly itchy! Many times the pleat on the inside has a scratchy piece of glue that rubs and is uncomfortable. Also, after nursing once or twice the stuffing gets all messed up and bunchy, which is a huge pain in public because it's hard to change them discreetly, but if you don't, it looks like you have a wad of Kleenex stuffed into your bra. Not cool. Stick with Lansinoh.
I love these nursing pads because they are thin and don't show through, but I don't have any issues with leakage. I only wear them just in case. I only wish that the wrappers opened like the Lansinoh ones.
I used these less than 2 years ago with my daughter and remember them being comparable to the lansinoh. This time around, I gave them another shot, and am very disappointed. They are rough and irritate my skin. Also, the adhesive does not hold well. There is only one "sticky" spot, which just doesn't cut it. I end up having to change them every time I nurse because they roll up inside my bra and won't stick back on. I've been perfectly happy withLansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)... and if you are ordering from amazon, they are much cheaper than these anyway.
These pads work fine for minimal leaking during the day, but are pretty worthless for heavy leaking. Once my baby started sleeping through the night, I would wake up with these saturated and my shirt drenched. Buy the lansinoh pads, they are much better for heavy leaks.
I had purchased these 4 years before and had great results and these are of the same quality and absorbency. I do not have large breasts so I didn't have any issues as some of the other mothers with it not holding up. I'm very happy with my purchase.
They are perfect for my usage.  I have tried others and these pads are my favorite.  Gerber pads end up with beads of white stuff after a while, I have no idea what they were but I threw them out.  I have no problems with these pads and would reccommend them to any nursing mother.
I have C-cup and I found that the fit was terrible. You could also see them under my clothes. But worst of all - it actually dried onto my nipple and tore some skin off when I tried to remove them!!!  I threw the rest of the box away.  Then I tried Lansanoh pads, both super absorbant & ultra thin, and loved them both. No problems with sticking. I don't recommend the Medela nursing pads at all.
These pads are very thin and do not show through your clothes.  I never leaked much, so these pads worked fine in that respect.  However, they do not hold up when you open your nursing bra for frequent breastfeeding.  The adhesive on the lining does not stay stuck to the bra and the absorbent filling comes loose and bunches up.If you have these, they will work, but I much prefer the Lansinoh pads.
I bought this for my first son three years ago.  He loved it and I'd have to restart it for him over and over (with or without the remote) because it captured his interest so well.  The motor (the purple ball-shaped section) died within the first three months, but when I called Tiny Love, the company that makes this, they sent a new one completely free of charge, and it continued to work well.The music is lovely and you can set it to just one tune or to cycle between the three different songs.  The animals are fabulous to look at - black and white plus bold colors, with buggy eyes to boot.Now, my second son is enjoying it.  As a matter of fact, now that it's up again, my three-year-old likes to turn it on to watch and listen too.I'd have given it less stars for breaking down, but getting free replacement parts and great customer service won back all the stars!
The Symphony in Motion mobile is a very entertaining diversion for babies.  Its bright colors and high-contrast black-and-white pieces create a scene that will captivate your little one.  For this reason, it's an invaluable crib toy that can buy you some of that hands-free time that's always in short supply for new parents.The music box plays a choice of three classical pieces.  While each is a soothing mid-tempo tune, the mobile is best suited for play time rather than nap time for two reasons:  first, with the mobile running, baby will be too involved in its motion (and could get overwhelmed and fussy if he/she is ready for some downtime).  Second, even with just the music box playing, the music is a little too loud for most young babies to sleep through.  As a result, we kept a separate item in the crib as a sleep-time routine (the Fisher-Price Aquarium, which is also excellent).We're using our mobile for our second child now and it's been a hit with each.  Even after our older one was too big for the mobile (i.e. could push up and reach/pull the pieces), he loved the music box by itself and would often turn it on by himself to entertain himself after having awakened from a nap.It comes with a remote control that lets you start/stop the mobile and music box for a distance in case you don't want to be a distraction to baby's downtime.  We've found battery life to be very good compared to most toys.PROS* Excellent attention-grabber; the combination of color and black-and-white really keeps baby's eyes following.* Nice playback of classical tunes - not too electronic or "toy" sounding.* Battery life is generally very good.CONS* Volume is too loud for soothing most babies to sleep.
My daughter loved the mobile on her pack-n-play so much that we decided to splurge on a nice one for her crib.  The symphony in motion one we got was the same as this only with farm animals and black-and-white swirls istead of colored ones.  She didn't like it at first... I think she was too young and got overstimulated.  When she grew accustomed to it, she started looking eagerly for it to start when I'd put her in her crib during the day (starting about 6 weeks).  At first she'd watch it for a few minutes but after a couple weeks she'd watch it and "talk" to it for up to 2 hrs straight... I'd just have to go in and push the start button every 15 mins!  Other times I'd put her down to watch the mobile and come back 20 mins later to a peacefully sleeping baby.  I love the classical music too... there's a couple fun and fast selections and a slower one that you can either cycle through or pick one to play all 15 mins.  It looks a little crazy at first, but if it'll entertain a 2 month old for 2 HOURS it's worth it's weight in gold!
This mobile has great colors, is very interesting and totally captivates the attention of my 10 week old.  It has nice music (not too mechanical or tinny sounding) and plays for a good amount of time - about 15 minutes.  I love to look at it too!I haven't had any of the mechanical problems that others have mentioned, but have noticed that sometimes if the mobile doesn't want to move, I just need to adjust it by moving the mobile unit in the stand (that attaches to the crib rail) just a little to the left or right.  The mobile will start back up at that point.
This mobile may be an eye-sore for your color-schemed decorated room, but it's worth every penny and obnoxiousness. We have gone through about 3 mobiles and our 2-month-old baby girl would not lie by herself in her crib without crying. Once we turn this mobile on, she has lasted for as long as 30-40 minutes!!! Our only complaint is that it should not stop. As soon as it does, we can hear her starting to get fussy again. They really should let the parents decide when toys should turn off (or at least have that option). The remote is a nice touch so that she does not see us in the room. However, she is so busy looking at the mobile that she does not notice us. This mobile is a life saver. We just wish it were a little more attractive....
My two cents about this fantastically designed mobile by the Tiny Love folks: our two-month old gets &quot;hipnotized&quot; by the figures SO MUCH, that the truth is he stops noticing anything else aruond him. This is why the remote is not that big of a deal: he doesn't really mind if you come in or out of the room, and as a matter of fact, he even loves the mobile if it's stopped. As for the figures, they are very colorful and well designed too... and the elephant is just too funny, twisting like crazy because of his extra weight).All in all, a highly recommended mobile (any Tiny Love), but if you want to save a few bucks ($10 I think it is), skip the Deluxe version and get the regular one.
This is a great product - my 2 month old is very entertained &amp; loves to watch &amp; listen!! Be careful, though, when first assembling the mobile - there's a little plastic piece that can easily break off if you don't follow the directions exactly, which can result in the mobile falling into the crib! This happened to me the first time, but Babies R Us was great &amp; let me exchange it for a new one without a problem. Also, I disagree with other reviewers that the remote control is a waste of money. I love it - it allows me to keep the mobile going without my son seeing me, which will often make him remember that &quot;hey, I'm in a crib &amp; not out with my people!!!&quot;
If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  It was the first toy my son paid any attention to at all, starting around when he was 3 weeks old.  Just when I was starting to feel desperate for him to have some fun on his own, I turned on this mobile and bingo! I was shocked.  He enjoyed the sights and sounds for 20 minutes!Since he loved this mobile so much, I tried another mobile.  No dice.  He only liked this one.  Something about it absolutely mesmerized him.  We have had it now for months and I have moved it to be used more as "nursery decor" since he's too old to have it where he might pull it down.This is a wonderful product.  Great gift for a shower, or for entertaining a very picky little baby!
I will lay her down and she will go through all three fifteen minutes settings, only fussing if we take to long to start it over.  I wish the one I purchased had a remote, and I also wish that it worked with an adapter, because the battery gets used up real fast.  Overall, very very happy with this product... that's both me and my daughter
Even though the blade is steel it took way too much work to get this food mill to mash up food. I put in some apple pieces and had to stand up at the table and push down with all my might while turning the handle to get the mill to work. Even then, it did a very poor job of grinding AND juice from the fruit leaked out the bottom of the mill. We also tried with bananas and got the same result. The plastic construction also gives it a flimsy and unstable feeling. Once, when pushing down while grinding, the whole thing slipped and tipped over.Worthless! I returned the product and will be buying a quality, heavy-duty food mill, even though it will cost me more.
It sounds like it worked for others, but I guess it just wasn't for me.  It seems to stick and feels like it would require a lot of pressure to actually get parts to move.  I tried it and thought I'd nock the table over it took so much pressure so I stopped.  I've had it in my car for months, but I can't bring myself to give it another try.  It was just too painful. I was really optimistic about it so I got rid of the box before I ever tried it so I couldn't return it.  I might sell it on e-bay or give it to someone.
This is the BEST product you can buy for your baby.  We used it at least once a day to grind up whatever we were eating - a super easy (just as easy as popping open a baby food jar), cheap and nutritious way to feed your baby good quality food that hasn't been pureed, water-down, and cooked to it's nutritional death!  It perfectly grinds up anything you can put in it - meat, cooked veggies, fruit, pasta, rice - you name it!  Your child will get used to normal food textures, flavors and the transition into non-baby food will be much easier.  It is incredibly easy to use and clean, and makes feeding your baby fresh, quality foods very inexpensive.  I cannot recommend this product higher!
good concept but very messy and hard to clean up. i should have bought ended up buying an electric food processor.
My son was 7 months old when I got this food mill.  I felt that this might be just another extra but I wanted to try it since my pediatrician recommended getting a food mill.  It has worked out great so far.  For example, last night I went to a family function.  I selected chicken casserole, green beans, and potatoes to put in the food mill.  I was able to feed my son easily and also clean up quickly by just putting the food mill  back into the tote to wash later.  I use it in restaurants and also at home.  I am very pleased with Kidco products so far and the reviews on their other products are consistently positive.  I feel confident from what I know so far that this is a great product for this stage of feeding.  I purchased this from Baby Depot but several stores also carry it including BRU.
I don't know if it works. It is still in it's plastic wrap. The reason I am writing a review is because I did not have to use it. I used a hand blender all the time when I had to puree food. When she was old enough to eat regular food, she didn't want pureed food any more. Just about everyone has a blender or food processor. Spend your money on something like more ice cube trays (to freeze your baby food) and pyrex containers (to store and heat up your babies food).
AND it's frustrating. It doesn't puree food, it's hard to clean, hard to use, and made from crappy plastic. What a waste! My mom said she had something similar when I was a baby and so bought me this, but I will NOT be buying this for my grandkids. I hope they discontinue it.
this mill is easy to use and easy to clean.  it doesn't puree. i started my 5 month old on carrots last week and used this. it works well but doesn't get the carrots to a straight mush. they kind of remained pellet like.  i wish there was another plastic piece with smaller holes.  either way it still worked and for the price you really can't beat it.
When I first showed this to my baby, he was too young for it and didn't express any interest, so I thought it was a wasted purchase. But when I tried again around 3 months, he was captivated, and he has been enjoying this for several weeks no, with no signs of losing interest! As he's getting older and more coordinated, he is taking more and more interest in the unique features of each section of this "book" -- like the string on the balloon, etc. I love that I can grab this and put it wherever my baby happens to be -- it's super portable. I'm glad I have this for my little one! It's also nice quality and will easily hold up for future babies.
I bought it while I was pregnant, and used it a day after we got home from the hospital. My baby is doing tummy time since day three, and the only reason she's agreeing to do that is because of this book! At first I showed her the black, and white and since she was 2 months I started to show her both sides- and she loves it! She can play with it for 30 minutes!I highly recommend it, especially because tummy time is so important and you must have something that will amuse them.And also, I love the products of Tiny Love. They have great quality and reasonable prices!
My son has stared at the images on this since he was one week old. It has ties on it so you can tie it to the crib. I tied it inside his play pen around the head end when he was 10 weeks old and it made him cry less at tummy time. In just 2 weeks, he now looks forward to tummy time so he can stare at the images. He looks the longest at the flower and the snail. Today I brought it out of the playpen, onto the floor (the accordian design keeps it standing up even after months of being tied to the crib side) and turned it around to the colorful side and the result was amazing! he cooed at it during tummy time for 15 minutes! This is especially great because I can fold it up and take it with me for the afternoon or on vacation so he can have tummy time anywhere! I would highly recommend this product!
I love the item because it is so versatile.  It can be used for tummy time, in a pack and play, crib, or sometimes I wrap it around her high chair and tuck the edges into her seat so she can view it while I  make dinner.  The item is long enough for my liking, but it does not act as a crib bumper as it definitely isn't long enough to go around the whole crib.  Pictures are stimulating, but doesn't keep her attention for long periods of time.
After 5 months it has held up very well, and there is room for everything.  It's also masculine enough for my DH to carry.
This is a great bag with a unique style.  There are some tacky diaper bags out there and I didn't want the black backpack style everyone has nor the purse-like option either.  Therefore, the husband won't mind grabbing this if needed.  Comfy to carry and there is plenty of room for baby's items, as well as yours.  My younger sister helped me pick it out, so I knew it was the stylish choice.  When I am out and about I receive many compliments on it.
I love this bag!  There is plenty of room in it to fit all my little one's stuff (and I like to overpack).I really like the plastic pouch inside.  It has come in handy several times when she has had accidents and we need somewhere to put wet clothes.At first I wondered why the strap had velcro on it.  I was excited to discover that you can unclip and unvelcro it and attach it to the handle of your stroller!  This is my favorite thing about the bag!  It is very comfortable to carry too.  I am so glad I picked it because it is great!
This is a super diaper bag.  It is durable in construction, yet sleek looking and colored neutral.  Nice slender design and it has much more space than it may appear.  I do wish it were a teensy bit larger, but I returned my first purchase of a ridiculously huge diaper bag.  This bag seems to be working great so far, and does fit all the necessities for my newborn.Update March 06:  still a great bag as baby continues to grow.  We are now able to make room for additional food and toys.  Lots of space in this slim design!  Fits nicely in the stroller basket.
This is a great bag for longer trips.  It holds so much and is very durable.  The changing pad is a great size.  Both my husband and I love the look of the bag.  We feel a little more trendy when carrying this one.
We got this for our baby at about 5 months and he has loved it ever since (almost 9 months old now). Toys come out easily to be de-slimed, lots of things to look at and chew on. He absolutely loves jumping up and down in it, especially to attract our attention (or that of our dog). Songs are not annoying. Takes a little patience to assemble, but overall an excellent toy. Theme is cute as well.
I wasn't sure about which saucer to get but finally decided on this one and I'm so glad I did.  When my daughter was 4 months old, we had to prop her up with a blanket.  She didn't like the saucer very much and preferred her swing.  But when she got a few weeks older, she really started to enjoy it.  Now she likes all the toys and has a great time bouncing around.  It's also helped her learn to sit up and, at seven months, her legs are strong.  No matter what direction she's facing as soon as the music starts she whips around and kisses the king.Our only problem thus far is that when we're transporting the saucer the castle sometimes falls out.  But not a big deal.We accidentally left the saucer at my parents for two days and my daughter was just not the same.  She really loves this toy.  And I love that I can put her in it and move around the house to do my chores.I would definitely, definitely, definitely recommend this saucer!  Don't be discouraged if your child doesn't take to it at the minimum age (4 months I think).  A few weeks may make all the difference!
I purchased the ExerSaucer that was one step up from the Ultra.  It is exactly the same, except it has additional toys.  I was a nightmare to put together!!  But in the end, it made my little girl very happy!  She is 6 months and weights 13lb.  She is very pettite, but still fits in this item well.  She gets a little overwhelmed with all the toys around her, so I remove a few of them and switch them out!  I will keep her entertained for quite awhile!!
I had this saucer on my registry and got it at my baby shower. I absolutly loved it. I couldn't wait for my son to be old enough to use it (4 months). He is 10 months now and still plays in it for hours. It adjusted to his height as he grew. It's made very sturdy, I've had no problems with it. It is easy to clean and keep clean. My son is very strong and active and has never been able to tip it over or break any of the toys on it. I would recommend this product to anyone!
I bought this to help with my daughter's "tummy time".  It's not as high as my regular Boppy and I hoped she would enjoy it.  She still doesn't love "tummy time", but the pillow does make it easier.
Some boppy pillows are a bit to big so this tummy time boppy is a great choice!! Highly recommend it!
We bought this cover not too long ago and we love it!  Yes, we can see the print through from our Boppy but we don't really care since it's nice and soft for our baby.  It would be nice if it was thicker and covered the print.  If you're looking for water proof than this isn't the way to go but if you're looking for something that's going to be soft and comfortable for baby I'd suggest one of these.
I had this with my daughter, and it was very well made and did help, but I still felt like I was bending over to much to feed my baby. I gave it 4 stars because it could have been my fault with why it didnt work well for me. This time around I am using the best friend , the one that wraps around you so you can move and walk. A little more practical now that I have a toddler to run after!
This cover is very soft, love the way it feels... so far it hasn't stained. I'm very pleased with it. It is somewhat easy to see through... not a big deal for me because my Boppy is a pink gingham check, so pink on top looks fine. I can see where you wouldn't want to put this over some of the Boppy prints.
This makes the boppy 100 times nicer.  It is soft and wonderful.
I got a Boppy with my first child in 2002 and hated having to wash it and dry it all of the time.  When I had my daughter in 2005, I bought this slipcover.  I loved it!  It washes so easily.  You just unzip it, wash it and zip it back on.  I used it while I nursed her for a year.  I had another daughter this year.  I have been using it for 4 months and it still looks brand new.  Plus, it is still just as soft as the first day I bought it.I had a son in 2006 and I bought a light blue one.  I also really love it.
The stitching is coming undone everywhere.  I returned the  blanket to the manufacturer and got a replacement blanket (which took forever) and it is coming undone too.  And everything shrank when I washed them.  Everything wrinkles really easily too.  Over priced and poor quality if you ask me.
We got this set 5 months ago (before we knew whether we were having a boy or a girl).  We painted the room a soft yellow and put up the matching border.  It looks beautiful.  The border went up really easily and we have had no problems with it coming "unstuck".  I wanted to do a "wild animal" theme and wanted to stay away from commercial characters like Disney.  This set was perfect.The set comes with 1 sheet, comforter, bumper, dust ruffle, and one curtain.  My only regret is that we didn't really need the whole set and would have saved money if we could have purchased only the itmes we needed.  We never used the curtain.  The comforter can't be used in the crib.  Who knew babies can't use any kind of blanket for the first year?  I do set it down on the floor as a mat sometimes though.  But, since this is my first child, I went all out.  We also bought the matching light switch and the wastebasket.  Then you can always accessorize with stuffed animals (giraffes, lions, etc)that are inexpensive and easy to find.  I also took some of the extra border and cut out some of the animals to use as stickers in a few spots on the walls (like over the changing table).  My son loves to try and grab at the animals and it keeps his attention as he is being changed.Last note - I threw the whole set in the washer on gentle cycle with Dreft and then into the Dryer and had NO shrinkage.
I really like this set and so does my little girl!  She likes to look at the animals on the bumper pads and on the border.  I use the quilt to decorate our glider since she can't use it in her bed.I gave this set 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought the bumper pads were really hard to get on.  We managed once I went over and looked at my friend's bedding set.  I think it should come with instructions.  My advice is to tie the pads to the corners of the crib first.  Then go back and do the other ties.  You really have to pull to get it to line up.  Once you get the pads on, it looks great!Also, the border came off in a couple of places, but we got some wallpaper paste, and it worked just fine and has stayed up ever since!  It looks great with her blue walls.Instead of buying the wall art, we cut a few squares out of the extra border and put them in frames.  It looks great and is a lot cheaper!Overall, I really like this set and would recommend it.
We bought this set plus the lamp shade, light switch cover and frame.  I wanted something gender neutral so that future children could also use it.  However, for the last 18 mos that our daughter has used it, I felt a little regret that I didn't get something more girly because quite frankly while this is "neutral", it's more boyish with the blue and green.  I do agree you could throw in some pink and purple to make it work better for a girl.As far as quality goes, it's satisfactory.  The sheet is holding up ok after dozens of washes but like most people have mentioned, this set wrinkles very easily.  I just ironed the diaper stacker and skirt and it looked fine again.  The comforter is stiff and polyester feeling.  Clearly, it's more for decor than for function.All in all I like it.
We used this hamper for nearly nine months for my daughter and it has been great. The mesh bag does make it very easy to move the dirty laundry to the washer. After about nine months we decided it was time to toss the denim portion into the wash. Following the instructions I was excited to have a revitalized hamper. Sadly, when I tried to fit it back onto the frame it had shrunk considerably. I will probably be able to rig it by sewing on some added Velcro, but would strongly recommend that you hand-wash and line dry, don't even let the dryer look at the wet item! :) Since I was really impressed with the idea of a washable hamper at the time of purchase we will not be buying one for Baby #2 when the time comes.
I love this hamper.  It looks nice in my daughters room and it is very versatile as well.  Inner bag lifts out easily for carrying to the washer/dryer.  Very durable and attractive.
This hamper is great and will match almost any color scheme.  My son's room is Lambs & Ivy Precious Cargo and the blue goes perfectly!Some people are complaining about shrinkage, but the inside mesh liner keeps the actual hamper from getting dirty.  The actual fabric of the hamper is such a snug fit that I can see where any shrinkage would make it a problem to put it back on.  But like I said, I haven't needed to wash the fabric...but I've thrown the mesh bag in the wash HUNDREDS of times.  No problems there!  Definitely worth the price!
Great for eating out!!!  We know that the chair is clean and sanitary.  She is at the table with us instead of lower than the table.  She adores the hippos!  My only complaint is that it folds slightly, but is still somewhat bulky.
We decided to get this instead of a highchair - we can hook it to either our kitchen table or island.  Our daughter likes being at the table with us.  We don't have room for some enormous highchair.  I was so glad to have found this!
We got this item as a late shower gift and we love it.  Our daughter is in a bigger carseat now so we no longer have the luxery of the carrier seat when we go out to dinner.  But she also lacks the abilty to sit up totally on her own.  She needed more support than the typical public highchair.  This item gives her that!  It gives her the back support to sit up during dinner and she loves it.  She will sit there and play and look around the whole time!  It is also making her more confident as she is learneing to sit up on her own.Another big plus for us it that it is always clean!  The public ones can be so dirty and gross sometimes, but we never have to worry now!  Another great feature for us was that it folds and stores easliy in any car and attaches in a stap to any table.This seat really is a great idea and a toatl must hvae when your child is out of the carrier.
I agree with a previous reviewer- there is nothing bad to say about this toy.This toy begins with an option that the baby can lay under it and play with the dangling toys. As the child grows to a sitting position your child can sit at this toy and play the keys. When your child is standing the piano can stand at a higher level and your child can still play on this toy.You can also set the music to play one note at a time, rotate through songs or be silent.I like that. As your child grows, this toy will also grow with your child. Although I try to find toys that do more than make noise or light up at a push of a button, this is a fine toy. The music is not so loud that it becomes quickly annoying.This is overall a fun toy. My five year old will once in a while play with it or play with the baby while the baby plays with it. My three year old enjoys dancing to the music. THe songs are long enough to make it worth a few twirls.Enjoy.
This is just "the toy."  I received this as a shower gift but when my baby was born, he was scared witless of it.  After about 5 months, he fell in love with it and used it daily.  He loved to figure out what all the toys did, the cause and effect, and all the lights and music it makes just intrigued him for hours.  Now he's three and still likes it!  It's a  standup keyboard now and he loves making music with it.  Just one of those toys that should be in every home.
I bought this when our son was 2 1/2 months old. He seemed to delight in the fact that by waving around his arms, he could hit the toys and cause the music and lights to go off. Now, at 5 months, he can grab at the toys and hit the keys. The music is enjoyable (not tinny sounding like other toys) and there are so many different sounds and sound bits that I can't keep track. I would recommend using the 2nd level for babies that are very active, this way they learn cause and effect. A great toy all around!
There is nothing better than finding toys that will last from the time the baby is born until he can stand! Our son loved this toy when he was too little to sit up and play with the keys...but he loves it even more now that he's sitting and can &quot;play&quot; the piano. He spends more time pounding on this toy than anything else we own! With all the wear this toy has taken the last few months, we are really impressed with how its performed. Definitely a sturdy toy!
My son loved this toy from the 1st day I bought it for him!!! It is really fun and gets a childs attention. I would recommend it to others. Thumbs up!!
I have a Sparkling Symphony Gym and was going to get another one for a friend. But found out that it has been discontinued and replaced by this one. Upon setting up, I noticed there's switch for either piano or chorus for the keys. So this is definitely new feature in addition to the other new feature(sitting position).The music is so nice with lovely children's voice. There're some more melodies that the Sparkling Symphony Gym does not have, a couple of which are even quite touching and certainly very soothing.Additionally, the smiley faces are very charming and they even show little tongues when lit up.The only 2 things that're not as good as the Sparkling Symphony Gym is that the piano keys make quite loud tapping noise, and the piano sound is less crispy.  But all other better/new features made up for these.So we're actually keeping both! This one is set in sitting position while Sparkling Symphony Gym keeps our 8 month old entertained while standing ...
My son got this again from my niece and he loved it fromthe get-go. he was a month old when we got it and he has been playing with it ever since. He would cry until we put him uder the singing stars. He would watch in amazement. He is now 6 months old and sitting and we converted it to Stage 2 and he loves it in a whole new way! It is a super durable toy with a nice variety in music. It is simple for him to use and entertaining. It's a great price for all teh use you will get out of this item!
This is a nice thing to have in the car.  The mirror is nice for me to keep an eye on the baby.  The colors & animals are nice for baby.  The music is nice and lights are great for baby.  The remote control is nice for me while driving.  I would tell anyone to buy this.
This mirror works so well! From the time I brought my son home from the hospital he hated riding in the car. He would scream the whole time. When I put this mirror in the back seat, it entertained him immediately. It is remote control activated so I can shut it on and off when I need to. The mirror is big as well so I can watch every move that he makes. The characters on the sides light up. This is a must have. I dont' have one complaint about this
The big mirror gives you a nice view of baby.  The lights are fun to look at for a really young baby that gets bored in the car and doesn't like to sleep in the car seat.  The music is okay.  It doesn't fit great on our head rests (Hyundai Entourage) and easily gets dislodged.  If your baby screams uncontrollably in the car (like ours did for a coulple of months) this probably won't make any difference because they'll never notice it.  However, if they're just a bit fussy or bored this is nice.
I bought mine March 9, 2009 and it's August 7, 2009 and it no longer works.  The remote with very fresh batteries will turn the music on, but you have to shut it off manually. The music is annoying so leaving it on after the baby has gone to sleep can drive you nuts.  I did really like it at first though.  It takes some adjusting and it does tend to move around.
I love this item!!  We bought ours when our baby was 3 months old and I would be driving alone in the morning to drop her off at daycare.  I love the big mirror, you can actually see everything while driving.  I don't recommend looking back and checking every minute, but once in awhile is great.  The other use is the lights and music it plays.  Our baby loves it.  And most times it puts her to sleep.  If she is getting fussy in the car I just turn it on and it quiets her.  I don't over use it, I only use it when I HAVE to and it works well for calming her.  Great item!!As my duaghter got older, she liked to look at herself too to keep her preoccupied.  Since our daughter is very petite, She was 17 months old before we could put her front facing, so the last few months using the rear facing car seat were trying.  I think she actually used it to look at us too during that time.  Great item!!
SO we were taking a very long, very boring car trip and I thought that having a mirror with lights and sounds would work wonders for our 4 month old. It would have been helpful if it had WORKED. We stop four times at different Walmarts along the way (where I purchased the first) and NONE of them worked. I talked to one lady who said that she had already had 3 returned that morning. Save yourself the hassle and buy a different mirror!
We bought this to see the baby in the rear view mirror.  This mirror was a big disappointment because it was totally useless for that purpose.  It was really really difficult to attach the mirror - there was absolutely no place to attach it in order to see the baby.  Instead, it is kind of useful as a mirror to entertain the baby in the car.  BUt I wouldn't spend $20 on a mirror for that purpose!  I guess the music is ok, but we can easily use a CD with better music for those purposes.
My son absolutely loves this mirror.  He laughs and smiles at himself.  He does not like riding in the car without this mirror.As for me, I have my pros and CONS!  My pro is I can see my son at all times.  I feel much safer knowing I can see him.  Also, it's fun to look up and see his beautiful face as he recognizes himself and that he is truly gorgeous.  The remote is convenient to turn on music if he starts to fuss.My cons are as follows:  The remote is great, but it requires you to leave the mirror on, which doesn't allow long battery life.  My mirror looked a little hazy when I installed it, thinking it was just finger prints, I left it until this week.  It ONLY took me between 5-10 minutes to unhook it from the car.  When I tried to clean it (first water, then window spray, then some windshield wax)  it went from hazy, to more hazy, to scratched, to beyond scratched, to wiping some of the mirror away.Well, I decided I'd go without it since I don't feel like wasting $20 again.  That was until my son was in the car crying because he is used to seeing his beautiful face.  I think I may try a different brand mirror this time.
I love this. How did I live with out this with my older child??The mirror is HUGE. Not only can I see her as clear as day, she can see herself. I dont know if there is a newer version but unlike a previous reviewer, Mine has an on/off switch as well as volume control on the mirror. Anytime she gets fussy in the car I turn it on (with the remote I keep in a pocket on my visor) and she totally loves the music and lights.I have two small complaints that dont detract from the toy. One, the remote is large and the clip doesnt attach to the visor. I had it bounce off my forhead the first time I tried to put it there.I have it in the pocket of my visor organizer but now I cant put the visor up. But its worth it to be able to instantly settle her down and see her. The other complaint is it was the DEVIL to put in my car. After many many tries I gave up and was ready to pitch it. My husband finally figured it out. Its instructions werent helpful.  But once it was there, its great.
One thing I liked about this mirror was the bright colors, shapes and animals along the border.  My son did like to look at them.  I ended up returning this mirror though for a few reasons.I could not get this mirror to stay put in my car.  I tried three different methods/positions of installing it and it had shifted each time I got in the car.  I thought I would like it because the mirror was so big and it would be easy to see my baby, but each shift resulted in my baby being out of view.The noises that came out of it were horrible.  I thought it was supposed to play a song, but it was just some grinding static-like noise.  I tried replacing the batteries to see if I could get music, but I did not.The remote did not work unless it was within a few inches of the mirror.  It was not practical or safe for me to reach back behind myself while driving. I tried replacing these batteries too, to no avail.Perhaps mine was just defective.  After all, I've been quite happy with other Fisher Price items I own.
I really like the way this mobile looks on my son's crib.  He can see more than just the underside of Pooh and his buddies, which is more than I can say for many of the mobiles out there.  With this mobile, he can see a variety of colors and faces.  In the center is a bee with a baby safe mirror so that my son can see his own reflection.  It is a wind-up, which is a bit annoying.  My biggest complaint is with assembly.  After I FINALLY got the mobile and all its components out of the very extensive packaging, I found that that the ONLY way it will fit together is when you put the big, round, screw-on anchor in on the crib side instead of on the outside of the crib.  We even took it apart and tried to get it to work the other way, but it doesn't.  So my son's bumper sticks out quite a bit because of this.
My son was about 2 months old when I took him from the basinett and put him in the crib.  He instantly fell in love with his mobile.  In my opinion, the music plays just long enough.  If it plays TOO long, then it will just keep him up.  Also, by the time it is done, I am in my bedroom and ready to set up the monitor.  I like to hear him, not the mobile... know what I mean?  I especially like the little bumble bee in the middle with the reflective surface.  It gives it the added touch some other mobiles miss.Another great feature - you can attach this to the wall if needed.  I don't know if I will ever take advantage of this feature, but I like knowing I have that option!I give this a definite two thumbs up!
Well, I looked for Pooh mobiles which would go with the 123 ABC bedding set and this one fit the bill.  The characters all face down so he can see more than just their bellies!  And the reflective surface on the bottom of the bee in the middle has been a real attention getter!  The music lasts a while once you wind it up and it has been great for keeping him entertained in his crib while I run to get a load of clothes to put away or run to the bathroom.  It sings that "winnie the pooh" song....and I haven't gotten sick of it yet.  Also, I was able to put it together myself and I don't think of myself as technically savy.The only drawback to the mobile is that the big bulb you use to attach it to the crib is pretty big and has to go on the inside of the crib, which I was worried about being a safety hazard.  Really, all it has done is create a bump in the bumper, but my son actually likes it to cuddle next to.He is almost 4 months old now and we use it all the time.  I doubt that I will attach it to the wall when he gets bigger, but it has that feature.  I know that we will have to remove it once he figures out how to get up on hands and knees which shouldn't be too much longer, but I think we got our use out of this mobile.
Installation can be tricky based on your stairwell design.  I had to add some wood pieces to make it line up correctly.  However, once installed it outperforms the models all of my friends currently have.  It is so easy to open and close.  I love it!!  I almost want to purchase it for my friends because the systems they have are rather annoying.
This is probably the worst product I have ever bought.With two children 16 months apart, I knew I'd need an installed gate for our ground floor.  Based on the ratings in Consumer Reports and the reviews on this website, I eagerly purchased two of these to keep the kids in our living room.The instructions were very clear and I was looking forward to installing the gates.  I figured it would take time but if I followed all the steps, it should be simple.  Nothing could've been further from the truth.We used the templates provided by The First Years and they were of no use.  I ended up drilling and re-drilling in all four walls.  One wall we had to replaster and I will have to repaint when I have the time.We had to make TWO trips to Home Depot to get replacement screws.  The heads of the screws provided in the box continued to break whether we used a power screwdriver or tried to install them by hand.  Fortunately, we never had a problem with the Home Depot screws.Please, I beg you not to waste your money on this product.
I really like this stepstool.  It is nice that it has two height adjustments.  We mostly use it as a step for my 3 year old when she is using the potty.  We have tall sinks so this stool isn't tall enough to help her reach the sink.  It is nice and sturdy and it is really easy to wipe clean.  I had been using this to store bath toys but I don't think they were drying off enough so I switched to a hanging net.  I would say this is great as a stool though.
This side seat has been a complete blessing for me!!!  Now that I'm putting her baby tub in our regular tub (we used to put it in our kitchen sink, until she started grabbing for the faucet!!), this totally saves my back from being sore.  It allows me to ergonomically keep my spine in a good position, while washing my baby.  I haven't really stored anything inside it, since I keep her toys/wash right in her bath but the storage seemed a good size.  I found it a little hard to open, but that could be user defect (me!!).
We have this stool in our bathroom--my 2.5 year old now uses it to stand on to wash his hands.  The storage inside is a great feature--we put his pull-ups in it. Also I like the two height adjustmetnts.  It's very stable--so when my son stands on it, I don't have to worry that he's going to fall over!  This is a fabulous product!
This is one of the best things they have come out with. It is great for sitting on when you are giving the baby a bath so you are not killing your knees and your back. It is also a great place to store all the baby's bath supplies. I would recommend this seat to everyone!!
My baby girl uses this stool a LOT.  Mostly it stays in the bathroom so she can get on the toilet and was her hands at the sink.  It has nice storage room and is easy to adjust up and down.  Sturdy construction as I can use it when giving her a bath as a seat and I'm not a small guy.
This has been a great seat for me during bath times. My back doesn't hurt and I don't have to worry about having to take a bath with my little one to give her one (which was actually stressful on my back). I can't straddle it to sit, but seating sideways and slight twist to bathe her, isn't bothering me at all. There is a print on top of the lid that states not to stand on this in it's highest level, so make sure to read and follow that for safety reasons. I have used it for stepping during a movie. It's pretty high (got me sweating), and not very wide, but it's the same as if I did it with my unused phone books (but wider). I don't use the storage unit, but I'm sure I will sometime in the future when I need some storage for the many little toys we seem to be collecting throughout the months :)
My twin boys are now 20 months old, and I have had this since they were 5 months old (using the safer bathers in the tub) and I LOVE it. I put a little cardboard divider inside and on one half I store DRY washcloths, baby toothpaste and brushes and un-opened soaps. On the other half I store toys, shampoo, used soap and anything else that my boys used in the tub thats wet but doesnt need to be washed! It is very handy and I dont have to fumble through the cabinets. It stores things in them and they never get moldy or gross smelling because there are vents on the sides! Its also a very large space and the top is easy for me to open but my boys havent figured it out yet. I also dont have to worry about my boys knocking things off the side of the tub. It is also very comfortable to sit on, and it has height adjustments! My back never aches anymore and this seat is quite sturdy! My boys use it as a step stool too and it doesnt slide around much (although we use it on a bath mat). They are "standing" boys so when they start using the real potty this will be great for them to reach. This is a very versital gift and it keeps my bathroom looking very nice, you dont see all the clutter that would be there if I didnt have this stool! I also plan on using this stool for my 4 month old, but right now he doesnt really have many "condiments"
It is very unsteady as a stepstool when put on the highest setting.Its great for sitting on it.  we use it by the tub to sit and play with our son while he's in the tub.  It is steady enough when on its lowest setting, but if you raise the height is DANGEROUS to use as a stepstool as the top is NOT secure when on the higher setting.For what we need it to do, it works well for us.  The seat base is wide so sitting is pretty comfortable for us.  You can store things in the seat base, but we don't bother to do so.  It is easy to raise to a higher setting, just take the top off and turn it around to sit a bit higher.
I keep this in the bathroom at all times.  Plenty of room to hold all of the baby's bath stuff and great to use to sit on while giving the little one a bath.  Later it can be used as a step stool as they grow.
I like the storage aspect of this seat and hope to utilize it as a step stool for my son.  However, I find this seat to be a bit hard to sit on for any length of time.  I have used it as a step for aerobics like another reviewer suggested and it worked fine for that so it has helped me get some weight off after I had my son.  I would just like some sort of cushion to be added to the top for comfort.  It is a unique product overall so I felt like it deserved at least 4 stars.  I have added an old boating flotation pillow to the top for comfort and it is just the perfect size for it and adds the cushion I needed.
The tub side seat has been wonderful, I use this every night to sit on next to the tub as I bathe my daughter. I am not a tiny woman and the seat fits me just fine. Inside right now we keep an ample supply of baby washes and washcloths, making this seat a great organizer. In the future I imagine we will store my daughter's tub toys as well. It let's me sit at a good height to wash her and I never get a backache or kneeache. This seat is a deal for the price!
This stepstool is very sturdy.  It is easy to open and close the top.  It works well for our purposes.
Great height to sit on while washing the baby in our deep soaking tub (I have to use it at the highest setting).  I like that it has padding on the bottom to prevent slipping on the floor.  We haven't used it as a step stool but I see no problems with using it at the lowest setting as instructed.  It seems very stable.
i am very happy with this purchase. its comfy to sit on and it suprisingly holds a good amount of stuff!
I had bought one of these almost 4 years back. I still have it & still works well. Needed an additional one for my son & thought of trying the Baby Bjorn step stool, but it turned out to be too small. This step stool is just perfect in every which way. So I returned Baby Bjorn & bought this one instead...once again.50 stars worth
This is the perfect height for your bath time ritual. I had to put mine to the highest position by rotating the lid and it is very secure for sitting. I have not used this as a stool but it seems like it would be sturdy. Of note: The lid is slightly rounded.
We used this once.. It was just not needed... roll some receiving blankets and viola... I would not spend the money on this again.
I originally bought this as a way to make sure my baby stayed on her back or side while sleeping.  It works great for this!  However, I found an even better use!  My baby kicks the blankets off of her every night, even if I swaddle her, and I used to worry all night that she was uncovered and cold.  So I take a receiving blanket and tuck it in all around her under the sleep positioner mat, so it makes it very hard for her to kick off the covers!  I think this is a must have for all new parents and babies!
Our newborn likes rolling onto his side when he's sleeping and this has been awesome.  He doesn't mind it being there but it keeps him still.  It's also washable for accidents and when he spits up a little bit.
I like this--it stays put.  It will only be good for a limited amount of time, but I really don't care--it wasn't that expensive and it's easy to clean.  I got several of them actually.
When I was registering for baby products, someone told me I didn't really need this and that I can roll up blankets to place behind my babies at night.  I registered for this anyway and was really happy that I did.  It gave me peace of mind at night that my daughters would not roll over on their stomachs when sleeping on their sides.  (I also put them on their sides to sleep as this was how they were positioned in the hospital).  I even bought two more to keep at my parents' house for overnight visits.  It is a relatively inexpensive item and although it might not be a necessity, I would recommend it to any new mom.
This is a great concept, but... My son was squirmy enough from the beginning that he managed to slither out of this after a week or two.  He would be half out of the top after an hour or so.  It just didn't keep him in place and I was afraid with him moving around so much anyway, it may actually be dangerous.Also, (he was a June baby) the polyester type material made him very sweaty, which contributed further to multiple nightime awakenings.  I kept thinking he had leaked out of his diaper before I realized his sides were sweaty from this product.
I love this wedge!  It was recommended to us by a friend who used it for her son.  Well, it is the most comfortable one that we have found and actually helps our challenging sleeper nap in his crib (either on his back and side -- whichever he prefers that day &lt;rolls eyes>)!!What I like:-The memory foam is very, very comfortable without being too soft.-It is meant to sit on top of the mattress and sheet which makes it a lot easier to wipe down/remove if he spits up on it.  (With our other wedge, you had to completely strip the bed to get to the wedge -- what a pain!!!)-The cover is breathable and can be taken off to put in the wash as needed.-The sleep positioners are both attached by velcro... so it is easy to reposition them (or not use them at all).  While using the sleep positioners, we had no problems with are son sliding to the bottom (or some such thing)... plus the positioners helped us put him on his side when he refuses (and I mean *REFUSES* with a capital "R" for rampage!!!) to sleep on his back.  For that... I owe "Especially for Baby" a big 'THANK THE STARS YOU MADE THIS ITEM'!!! ;)My one real complaint is that it's width is too small for babies from about 5 months onward.  I really wish they'd make one twice the width (to fit across a standard crib). To compensate for this, I bought two and stiched the covers together so they'd lay next to each other as one unit.  This has (obviously) doubled the width and seems to work well enough for my son to get him sleeping more in his crib (well, works better than anything else has -- and we've just about tried it all!).  If you stitch them correctly, there will be no gap between the two wedges and it will seem as one large wedge.  (Hope that helps the reviewer below! :)  )[Side note:  We did originally purchase a folding crib wedge that is wider, but... the foam in that is more firm and so not as comfortable for our son (er, doesn't 'give' at all!!! ugh!)... plus the outside of that one is plastic so he could slide down it easily and, even under the sheet, its not as breathable (Read that as... our baby got sweaty).]
My daughter was a preemie and she was in the hospital for one week before going home.  In the Hospital they put her to sleep on her tummy (because the machines and everything), so when she get home she didn't want to sleep on her back... In that moment this was a LIFE-SAVER... We start putting her on her side on this product (because she definilly didn't want to sleep on her back) and this keep her from moving.  Besides it keep her head a little bit up than her body, and she was really more comfortable that way.  The problem was that my daughter was really a big eater and she didn't fit on this after 3 1/2 months...
I absolutely love this inclined sleep as I had many, many restful nights because my baby was comfortable. I had a winter baby so I was able to tuck the covers under the pad and they never fell off. Also, I noticed my baby would spit up much less on the inclined sleep than when placed flat on his back. I also used my pregnancy wedge to further prop the inclined sleep so my baby would be more comfortable after a bottle. The combination of this inclined sleep and the Dr. Brown's bottles had my baby sleeping for many, many hours at night. It is a must for any new mom.
My mother in-law got this incliner for us since I refuse the use of pillows and blankets while my son is sleeping.  I was reluctant at first, but I gave it a try anyways.  I was impressed with the product coz it helped my son snoozed better.  It prevented him to roll over to his tummy.  It even helped him breathe better when he caught a bad colds because his head was slightly reclined higher than his chest. I guess it helped open up his airway.  It gave me less worries too about SIDS.  I'm pretty glad this recliner was ever invented.  My son & I love it.
I can see why many people found this product not helpful.  However, I feel if you have problem with your baby sleeping, this is something worth to try.  This wedge really helps my son sleep.My problem now is that he is 6 month and growing out of this.  Can I please know from someone who also likes this product, what is your solution when your baby is growing out of it?  My son has a hard time to fall sleep without the wedge.  He would roll over everywhere in his crib for more than an hour and cry very hard.
My baby was rolling over the first week he was home!  I know that is strange, so we went and bought this and it saved me from the worries at night.  He is 8 weeks now and not rolling over for the time being, so I keep this with the tub in the kitchen.  I lay this out next to the tub with the towels and blankets on it for him when I get him out of the tub to wrap him nice and warm.  I like the padding of it.  I also use it on the sofa when he wants to sleep out there.  It is not a lot of money for the many uses you can have with it.
I bought this for my son to try and get him to sleep properly but he ended up finding ways to escape it. I tried this on him for three days but I would get up to find him slid out of it, giving me his mischievious grin. Luckily I was able to return it and get back the money I wasted. I think it's useless. Babies are too smart for this. They will find ways out of it.
i registered and received this item, but returned it because i wanted to possibly use the baby snuggle nest, but ultimately had baby sleep in car seat for a while near me, and then when in crib she was swaddled and couldnt roll over, and as for the incline i purchased the crib wedge that is the width of the crib unlike the smallness of this one, which is great when your baby can finally move around in the crib. this basically is one of the many items aimed at the nervous new mom, but a waste
We returned it because we really were unhappy with it. Our baby would slip down and it was akward for her to sleep in. We purchased the "First Years Air Flow" sleep positioner instead and love it.
I bought this when my daughter was a month old and had terrible reflux.  Not only did it not help the reflux, but I don't feel it was safe and it didn't hold up in the washing machine.  On several occasions, my daughter ended up sliding down in between the side positioners.  She was very small, born just over 5lbs, and did not fit to well in this.  Because of her reflux, I needed this to stand up to repeated washings.  Even with putting absorbant materieal on top of this to try and protect it, she still spit up right through it.  When I washed this item, it ended up being deformed.  Save your money and find something else.  This product is not grea.t  The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is my daughter seemed somewhat comfortable in it, that it until she fell in between the positioners.
This was fine for the first couple weeks, then I realized that it actually didn't do much help.  Sometimes it would slide up or down and just wasn't long enough for him (and my guy is a short guy!).  I then just used the trick that they did in the hospital and rolled up a couple of baby blankets and placed one on each side of him.  Worked perfect!
It kept our baby in place and prevented rolling. After a while though, she learned to scoot off the top of it, so we just stuck the side things onto a cloth diaper. They stuck very well to that, but she was flat and couldn't scoot up and out anymore.One of the best things about this was that it kept the swaddling in place.I also used the side things (and the cloth diaper) in the swing when she was very tiny  to keep her from slumping over too much.
Very useful.  I love this and really knew that he was safe.  Only one problem.  When you take the cover off to wash it forget about getting it back over the foam again.  So what I did is I put the foam thing under the bassinett mattress.  Then the side part has velcro on the bottom so it sticks to anything so the mattress sheets works perfect.
I wish I had done more research before buying this item.  After talking to the hospital staff & reading parents' comments here, I do not plan to use it for my newborn.  SIDS experts do not approve of its use for the very reason many moms are talking about here...it is made of soft foam and can suffocate babies.  (especially given that the baby can slide down the incline and get there nose/mouth covered by the soft side cushions.  $20 wasted for me!
A great idea for newborns &amp; mommies who are paranoid that sleeping flat on thier backs will cause choking!! Our 2-month old has nearly outgrown his, but I would still recommend getting one. I liked that it didn't have a separate &quot;pillow&quot; but rather a gradual incline. I also liked the side positioners, though I wish the velcro used for them was stronger as they are easily relocated or detached by his movements during the night. Another plus is the removable cover, which is machine-washable!
We loved this product.We started using this when we came home from the hsopital.Our son preferred it to the airflow positioner. The incline was just enough to help with our son's reflux problem so he wouldn't be laying flat after eating. I placed a lap pad in it as recommended by a friend, so if it became soiled, I could easily replace the lap pad instead of trying to wash the positioner itself.Our son is three months old, and still loves it.
I purchased the 'rest assured' sleep postioner for one of our twins girls & was given this 'inclined to sleep' from a friend, so decided to use that for our other twin girl.  I have to say I do not like the inclined to sleep at all.When I place my daughter on it she manages to slip down the angled pillow, so when I go in to check on her she is scrunched up at the bottom of it.  Kind of acts like a slide.  Also if the baby spits up & you have to wash it, then it takes a long time to dry the foam insert.Our other twin daughter has been using the 'rest assured' sleep positioner & I love it, so I just went out today & purchased a second one so they can both have a safe good nights sleep.
I give this product 5 stars.  Though my daughter is almost 10 months now, we used the positioner when she was a newborn and found it worked out great.  I had two: one for the crib (second floor) and one for the basinet in the pack and play (first floor).My little one preferred sleeping on her side and the positioner helped making sure she didn't roll back during her sleep.It also helped prevent "flat-head" as I would alternate sides every week.  It payed off.  Her head is a round and beautiful.One of the reviews stated the cover shrunk.  I washed our covers several times and didn't have any shrinking.  I just didn't dry them in the dryer.  They are fine if you hung-dry them.I like them so much I recommend them to my expectant friends.
We haven't had any problems with this, it is much more convenient than warming up a bottle using the stove.  I also like that the cord length can be adjusted so you can have just as much as you need on your countertop.
This was very useful to us and we always got it right the first time.  We never had too warm of bottles for our daughter.  We use the Avent bottles which are a lot bigger than most bottles (by girth) and they fit perfectly fine in this.
When my parents bought the base off our registry, they didn't understand why we'd need two bases for one car seat."Can't you just move yours between cars?  It's not like you'll be riding in our car that often"After we strapped the second base into their car, they hardly ever removed it and they relished the opportunities to pick up the baby on the spur of the moment.They were disappointed when the baby outgrew his Snugride seat and hoped I could find a similar base system for the next size of car seat.  After watching me move his convertible seat back and forth a few times, they've decided to install a second larger seat in their car to avoid the hassle.The Snugrider was a far more cost & space-effective solution than 2 car seats, and since the base only has to be installed once, people less familiar with the car seat can still safely move the baby in and out of the car repeatedly with greatly lessened risk of error.
My husband and I have been trying to reduce our years of accumulated clutter, and to our dismay that includes FOUR infant car seats including our brand-new DuoGlider SnugRide infant seat. We were planning on giving one to my mother-in-law, one to my sister-in-law, and keep the third for my husband's car, but then we realized that more than likely, if we brought the baby over to their homes, chances are the baby would already be in his car seat.  We were thrilled to find out that Graco sells a SnugRide car seat base separately! This way, we can bring our son to Grandma's and she can take him for a drive without having to wak him to move him from one seat to another. The extra car seat bases simplify our lives and help us get a little closer to getting rid of all the clutter in the garage, too. Plus, the car seat base works with both the Latch system and with a regular seat belt. A must-have for parents who have more than one car and who have nearby relatives eager to help watch baby!
This was supposed to be a universal for the classic connect system, but it really isn't. We had to return it for another Graco car seat base.
I ordered this for my husbands truck so that we don't have to constantly take mine out of the car everyday when I go to work.Fits and works  just perfectly.
It is great to have a spare for the Graco snugride car seat. My boyfriend and I just had a baby and started taking him to daycare. We decided that I would take our baby to daycare on my way to work and he would pick him up after work. Well, it was a good plan, except for the fact that the first day we did this we ran into the problem that I had the base in my car and my boyfriend had no way of getting the car seat in his car. After that we instantly bought a second base for his car. Very convenient if you have more than one vehicle. Plus it isn't that expensive to have, better and cheaper than buying a whole second carseat.
While shopping for our infant seat in BRU a father was in the store and told us how helpful having another base in my husband's car would be...well we received this as a gift and installed it in less than 15 minutes( it took awhile in my husbands car because he does not have latch)and is very secure. No slippage and movement. Placing your knee in the middle helps alot in making sure it is tight, so you may need another person if you are on the petite side. It is so helpful being able to lift her out and change cars if needed without major moving of bases.It took less than 5 minutes putting it in my SUV ( latch) and has not moved in 6 months...now she is outgrowing her Snugride infant seat so we will have to take these out but I would use this system again for our next child! I would give this 4 1/2 stars since putting it in took us a minute but that was nothing once it was in and we knew it was not going anywhere.
My wife and I have been long-time fans of our Graco infant seat, so much so that we would have been willing to purchase a second one in order to ensure that either my wife or I would always be ready to get up and go with our son when necessary.  However, Graco saved us from having to do that by offering this base alone as an accessory.Some other reviews have claimed that having an additional base isn't really necessary because LATCH allows you to easily move the base from car-to-car.  This sounds reasonable on paper, but breaks down in real life:*  What if one of your cars is older than 2001 and doesn't have LATCH?  Ask anyone who's correctly installed a car seat or base via the seatbelt and they'll confirm that it is a physically difficult endeavor.  Faced with a choice between regularly undergoing this exertion or else investing in an additional base and then leaving it in place, I'd bet 99% would go for the base (the other 1% apparently enjoy a vigorous workout at the most inopportune times).*  Will you always have the time to switch?  When you're commuting or traveling with an infant, time is an even more crucial resource than usual.  Plus, any number of other factors (What if you're alone with the baby?  What if the weather is severe?) could make the prospect of a guaranteed quick departure well worth the $40 spent on a spare base.*  What about unforseen schedule changes?  When our son began going to day care, he had to be brought home early on several occasions because of ailments.  Having a base in each car meant that either of us could go get him.  So if one of was too tied up at the office, we wouldn't have to stress over begging out of work early during a busy time.More than a simple convenience, having a base in each of your family's vehicles is an insurance policy against being painted into a corner when getting around town with your little one.  Any working parent will especially appreciate not having to stress over "do I have the car with the car seat?" at any given time.  We've gotten our money's worth out of this accessory time and time again.
Buying an extra base is so much cheaper and easier than having two car seats.  It is exactly the same as the base that came with my car seat.
we bought this to be able to use one car seat between cars. it rarely gets used in the other car because we take baby in the better car, but when needed it adds peace of mind and it fits most car seats even non Graco brands.
The SnugRide is a wonderful infant car seat, allowing for securing the child in the seat within the comfort of air-conditioning or indoor heat, depending on the season.  It pops right into the base in seconds, allowing for getting the child in the car quickly to avoid prolonged exposure to the weather.  If you own a Graco SnugRide and have 2 cars, it also really comes in handy to have an extra base.  Not all SnugRides have the same base color, so be sure to note which color the plastic is on the carseat before choosing the color for the extra base unit.
You can use the car seat without a base, but why torture yourself?  This based easily clips in and out easily and has a gauge to make sure baby is at the right angle.  And you can buy the base separately so there's one in each car.  Then getting in and out of the car is a easy.  And let's face it, when you have a little baby you don't need anything more difficult than it needs to be in your life!
This is a perfect match to our Graco travelling system, now we can leave a base unit in each car.
Use it with my granddaughter's carseat and it is great to just be able to take it out of my daughter's car and snap it into mine.
I was very happy to see there was an extra base we could get for our car seat, and this works great.
I have a snugride 35 carseat. Apparantly not all snugrides are considered equal when it comes to the base. I purchased this model thinking I would save money on my spare base. Now I have to return it and wait for the more expensive one to come. How hard is it to include in the product information that it excludes, or will only fit certain models?
It is so nice to be able to pick up an inexpensive base and use the same seat in two different cars.  I would recommend this highly to anyone with the Graco Snugride travel system.
This works well with the system, locks in the car seat securely.  No matter how much we tighten it, it just feels a bit wiggly, especially side to side.  We were kneeling on it while securing, so it's not like we just didn't pull hard enough.  It was easy to level with the car seat and it's safe, it just doesn't feel as secure as I'd like.  We have three of them, one in each car and one for the nanny, and each one works well with no variation in function.
I purchased the Alano &#34;Flip It&#34; Travel system 2 years ago (which I despise! Awful material used on the car seat, lack of padding where her little tush sits, the stroller is like a big tank, and difficult to fold.) for my first born. Now I've got my second baby coming in just around the corner. Planning to use the the same car seat & base however needed a second base for the in-laws car. I would get another car seat but I know I'm only going to use this for a year at most. I'll spend my money on a better convertible for baby number two. FYI, my daughter loves her Britax Marathon 70. Money well worth spent.The model number on my car seat base is 1761726. I had no idea if it was the snug fit 20? 22? or whatever numbers they have out there. It definitely looks like a &#34;classic&#34; aka old & simple model. I took  my chances with model 8402L04 based on the photos and from one good helpful review out of hundreds. Received the package after 2.5 days and they are exactly the same.Speaking of deliveries, selected the super saver delivery option. The estimated delivery date was a week. To my surprise, the base was delivered in 2.5 days! That's pretty darn awesome.
$30 is nothing compared to the time and energy saved with not having to juggle the whole car seat system around. If you own more than one car, get one for each! A convenience well worth the extra money.
Like many people we have more than one car in the family this system and extra base option allows for mom dad grandparents and sitter all to have a base installed and just move the car seat from vehicle to vehicle
This worked great for our snugride Infant car seat, Platinum, easy to install. Tip: we have a Audi Q5 and had to use a towel under the base due to it slipping. Once we put that under it, it worked just fine. We also loved the platinum car seat, baby was really comfy in it. Both worked great together.
This one is a total waste of plastic. I used it once a day and it lasted 7. I hate evenflo products but went against my better judgement anyway. The motor weakened by the day. IT IS LOUD!!! ALL NOISE NO WORK! I had to squeeze with the motor at the HIGHEST setting to get just a little.I would get about a total of 4-5oz after 30-45 min. When I called the company(which has the worst hours), they just sent me a bag of parts and said you figure it out. It took 2 wks for them to arrive. Parts made no difference. First they said no return. I said like hell you wont. Then they said only half the MSRP with me paying shipping. I still have the damn thing. Not even worth going to the PO for half the price minus shipping. I ended up with a free brand new medela hand pump from WIC(if I had only asked from the get go). With that one, I got a total of 10oz in 5-10 min. Next time around, I will fork out the money for the electric medelas. Cost more but they know what they are making.
I have been very satisfied with this pump and have not had any problems with it.I am using the same one for my second daughter that I used for my first.I usually use it every day,to relieve engorgement and to be able to freeze my milk for future use.You have to make sure to wet it so it will suction on well.I always use the lowest setting and it works fine for me.I have used it while riding in the car too,thanks to the batteries.If I had to rely on a pump all the time I would probably get a double pump.For what I use it for it has been great.You get what you pay for,and I don't know why these people expect it to work as well as a $200 Medela.
It dresses up the changing table and is large enough to put toys in it for storage.
... what can I say... Online, these baskets looked adorable and the review was a good one. Imagine my disappointment when I opened them up at my baby shower... As I pulled them out of the bos, chips of white paint came falling out of the baskets like snow!!! (Same goes for the matching hamper!)Also, the quality of the liners is pretty shabby... Expect the seams on the liners to be frayed, uneven, and single-stitched. If they had cost less, I wouldn't have been so disappointed in the quality. They are still very cute from a distance, just be forewarned about the quality!
I registered and recevied these baskets for my baby shower. I thought the were cute and would look cute in my sons room. I had planned to use them to hold diapers and baby toiletries. They would nave even worked nicely as little toy baskets, but I will not use them. The paint chips off VERY eaisly. It makes a mess of the whole house and fills up the baskets. I wouldn't want to put anything of my sons in them for fear paint chips would get on his things. I thought they would be better quality considering the price. Don't waste your money.
These are really cute.  They are very big. Too big that they wouldn't fit on the shelves I wanted them on.  I had to return them. If you have a deep wide spot to put them you will love them. I found this smaller & love it.
This hamper is way more than I was expecting, I love it!It's big enough for babies clothes and strong.I recomend it.
I put this diaper bag on my baby registry and someone bought it for the shower. By the way it looked online, i thought it was a small one day diaper bag, but it was bigger. This was a good thing. Being that my hubby's family lives in New Jersey we were able to pack clothes for the baby for two days or more. I love the material and the design goes great with the stroller and all our other baby things.
When I put this in my registry, I never knew how much I'd love it!  When my son was born, he spent 4 days in the NICU and was in the hospital until he was 18 days old.  This bag was with me at all times, carrying all the papers I was given at the hospital, my breast pump (not small!), drinks for my boyfriend and me, and anything else I needed.  Now that he's not in the hospital, it still goes everywhere the baby goes.  He has a heart moniter that fits well in addition to diapers, wipes, changing pads, two bottles, changes of clothes, and toys.  All of this fits great, and I haven't had any problems with any part of the bag tearing.  The bag ends up being pretty heavy, but it's held up very well.  The shoulder straps are comfortable and adjustable.  I also love the fact that it comes with a reusable changing pad.  When we're out and about, I like the Huggies disposable ones to use in public restrooms, but when I'm at someone's house, the reusable one come in handy.I think it's a fabulous bag, and I haven't had any problems with it, despite all it's been through!
This monitor is great! When I have the sound turned up I can hear my daughter breathing. If I have friends over while my daughter sleeps, I can turn the volume down and push the vibrate button and no one has to put up with the &quot;white noise&quot;. If my daughter wakes up, it will vibrate like a beeper. It also has a handy belt clip so I can wear it while vacuuming the house and  don't need to worry about listening for the baby when the vibrate feature is on.One reviewer complained that the life of her battery only lasts 20 minutes and that she constantly has to have her monitor plugged in. When you have this monitor plugged in, it's considered re-charging. Don't make the same mistake she did. Plug it in to re-charge, then unplug. It will last you a long time. I have been using this monitor for a year now and my battery is still working strong.
I love this monitor, except that I have the rechargeable model which does not hold a charge anymore.  I have used it every day for the last year and the charge kept getting shorter &amp; shorter.  It's still fine if you are in the house &amp; can plug it in.  On the positive side, it is crystal clear.  I can hear my baby girl breathing!  I can hear the next door neighbors in their back yard if it's turned up loud enough.  It is also small and lightweight, and clips nicely to your pants.  Oh, I did take it on vacation where we were in a condo and there was a lot of interference, may not be for apartment/condo dwellers.  I've heard with most monitors you need to try them to see what's best in your home.
I got this as a bridal shower gift or I probably never would've bought one.  As a new mom, I didn't plan on being out of my baby's sight.  It took me a few months to try it and learn to trust it.  From then on, it's one of our most popular baby devices.  I feed my horses and dogs while my daughter sleeps or plays in her pen without worry.  It picks up the slightest of sounds.  I use it when I'm upstairs in the shower and she stays in her pen sleeping.  It saves the hassle of moving her closer to me and waking her up or disturbing her play time. It has tremendous range and the portable or plug in feature is quite practical.  I think it is a great way to keep an eye on your little one when you need to run outside, shower, or be in another room altogether.  I'm very please with this product.
I love the vibration feature... thats why I picked this one. I have to do the yard work while my husband is away with the military and I can even mow the lawn and know when she wakes up. So far I haven't had a problem... twice I have had to replace the batteries in the mobile portion. The monitor seems to fade - you have to keep turning the volume up to hear and then it fuzzes, that's when the batteries need to be replaced. I hope that this is the only problem that I will have with it - I really like this one. Also, I have had no interference or problem getting out of range while working in the yard.
This monitor is fantastic. I can be wireless or not. And best of all you can wear it like a pager. That way I can feel it buzz when I'm mowing the lawn. It is loud, and crystal clear, and has a belt hook. Careful though, it will fall off your pants if you're not careful. I don't know how many times I have dropped this monitor. Good news is that it's really durable.
I LOVE this!!  It makes it so easy to bathe my toddler and my infant at the same time in the tub!!  I don't understand the problem in some of the other reviews that the footrest comes unsnapped... I have never had this problem, maybe it was corrected?  Anyhow... I love this bather and could NOT do without it!  It saves time and space (very compact and flat when folded up) and is holding up great.  (I've had it for about two months now.)  I would definately recommend this!
I love this chair!  It keeps my baby from slipping too far into the water.  I like that it folds up for easy storage and that the soapy water can go through so that I can rinse her easily.  It drys quickly too. We use it in the sink and we spray her off with the sprayer.  She loves her bath time and so do I!  We look forward to it and this chair makes it so easy!
I registered for this product because I have a small house and didn't have a good place to store a full-sized baby tub. This does fold up nice and small, but it is useless. The bottom of the chair sits an inch or two above the sink or tub- so in order to have the baby in any water, you need to fill up the sink quite a bit. With so much of the baby out of the water, my baby got cold very quickly. The mesh seat wicks the water all over, so she was sitting in a very wet chair. It was a disaster (think screaming, cold, baby). I ended up using a regular old baby tub, which if I twisted just the right way, fits under my bathroom sink.I was using this with a newborn, perhaps it would be better with an older baby.
I've started using it with my newborn and found it very easy to "shower" him by simply pouring water over him. Because it doesn't fit in my sink, I use it in the bath tub. This seat eliminates the whole "sitting in unclean water" thing. Plus the fact that it folds compactly is great. It can be used at home or when you are away. It fits neatly in any suitcase and dries quickly.
the frame is nice...the compound sucked.It didn't even take the mold of the foot...it just looks like a square of clay next to a picture of our babyMerry Christmas Grandma!
This is cute, and we had fun trying to get our son's hand print while he was asleep. It looks pretty cute, but don't expect it to be perfect. It is hard to get their hand or foot pressed in hard enough to make a good print without waking them (otherwise a hand print would be out of the question for our squirmy son). And when you cut the edges you can't get them quite perfect, nor can you roll it out perfectly flat without any flaws. Don't get me wrong, it looks good, just a warning for those perfectionists out there (I guess I am one!).
I bought this frame twice.  Once for my daughter and once for my son.  The frame is simple, which I love.The imprint material is great and easy to work with.  I just took it out of that package, worked with it a little, then rolled it out to imprint my child's hand or foot print.  No water required.  No mess to clean up.  There was no residue left on my children's hands either.
I love this product so much I bought 1 for all my friends. I plan on buying 1 for my sister also.
Impression material does not work. Would not keep the impression, it springs back. The frame is nice but not worth it if can't get an impression.
I agree with the previous review from "Meesah".  My daughter just turned 4 months and she is 15 pounds already...if I hadn't returned this car seat when she was 8 weeks old,weighed 11.13 pounds & was 24 1/2 inches, she probably would be falling out of it by now.  I agree that the canopy does absolutely nothing to shield infants from the sun.  It is a joke.  My daughter seemed uncomfortable in this car seat from day one.  I decided to return this car seat and the Venezia stroller to BRU when my baby was 8 weeks old...best decision I made.  I also had several problems with the stroller...I was walking in the mall one afternoon and 2 screws just fell off!!!!!!!!!!(this was one of many problems)  I was horrified.  Luckily, I stopped to see what it was.  I almost kept walking assuming it was something that the wheels ran over.  Right at that moment I knew I had made a huge and very expensive mistake...because of all the issues, BRU accepted my return and we bought the Eddie Bauer system instead.  My husband and I are very happy with the safety and comfort features of the Eddie Bauer system.  Wish we bought that one from the start.  Money doesn't always buy quality.  We learned our lesson the hard way.  We are much happier now and our daughter is too.
My baby loved this carseat. When she was about 5 weeks old we put her in to sleep at night and she immediately started sleeping through the night. She slept in this carseat, all buckled in, for many weeks (she did finally move to the crib). She thought it was very comfortable!I bought it because of its excellent safety record. I also really liked the colors. The fabric is wonderful- it washes very well and shows no wear. It is very easy to get in and out of the car. It is also easy to rock it on the floor- important for soothing a fussy baby (especially one who sleeps in her carseat at night). I highly recommend this!
We now have 4 of these between our two cars and they have worked great.  No complaints on them.  They stay put in the with each of the carseats (one toddler size and one infant).  They are very durable.
We have (4) of these in (2) different colors for each vehicle.  Love them.  They save the leather seats from the constant pressure of the seat and gunk that falls from our kids hands!
I just got a new car, and one of the first things I bought were two of these seat protectors for under our 3-yr-old and 18-mo-old's car seats.  Within the first week, the 3-yr-old had an accident in her car seat, and there was a puddle at the back of the seat saver.  I didn't have these in my old car, I can't imagine just how much got into the seats before. The only drawback I have found is that they don't conform so well to the captain's chairs in our car's back seat, and it was a little difficult to reach the LATCH hooks behind it.  I am definitely happy with them overall, and would buy again.
Purchased for my 2009 Honda Odyssey and love it. I'm very picky about keeping my car clean and the leather seats from getting beat up from the car seats. Great fit and even purchased a second seatsaver for my husbands Ford Escape.
This is actually the second one I have purchased.  Purchased for another vehicle.  Works great at protecting the seats and matches the car interior perfect!
After using multiple covers these are the best we have found.  They leave the least amount of indentions in the seats as others do.  The only draw back is they separate easy when the are getting installed due to the velcro.
I just had leather installed in the seats of my car so I figured I should buy something to protect them from my baby's car seat. I decided to give this product a try since the Lionheart brand has been very good in my experience with it. This item is fairly large, it will surely cover the seating area where the car seat goes, and a bit more also. I own an Chevrolet Equinox SUV, so I have medium sized space in the back seating area, so for me is not that troublesome. If you own a small car, you might want to rethink this purchase, because this seat saver will definitely take space from the other seating spaces in your car...people would have to seat over part of it, no kidding. It has a gray synthetic mesh underneath to help it adhere to the surface to prevent slippage. I read complaints about this gray material staining the surface underneath...I have not had that experience after a month of use, but were already on cooler climate, so that might explain it since these accidents are related to hot weather. If it happens I'll update this review for sure. Bottom line is that it is a very decent product and does what it is supposed to do, which is protect the seating surface. I would recommend it.
This thing is great.  We have bought 3-4 seat savers over the years and this is the favorite. The bottom is thick, so it protects your seat from imprints and the bottom is formed like a tray to keep spills and food from getting on your seat.  The one improvement, as others have said, is the back is a little short and doesn't go up the full height of the car seat.  So, it will leave imprints on your car's backrest.  Even with this minor issue, it is still the one I would buy again.
This keeps all of the sticky stuff off of my leather seats and thats exactly what I wanted it to do. It has also kept those deep indents that car seats leave behind off of my seats. the plastic is thick enough to protect the seat but does not get in the way of the car seats installation.
I have purchased this for our new car and while it definitely protects the seats and works well, the bottom part is too big and the passenger next to it can't actually easily buckle. It is probably better for a family car, type SUV. We have an economy size BMW so maybe this is the problem.
Very nicely made. I haven't got to use this yet but feels very durable and I think this will do great to save my leather seats in my car.
Love it...this is my 3rd one, more cars, more kids, more Seatsavers!!! Definitely a must have to save your seats!
My husband and I both have leather seats in our cars so we got this so our seats wouldn't be ruined by a car seat. It works perfect and I'm so glad we got it. Worth Every Penny!!
this is a great seat saver if you have leather seats but i would suggested that if you live in a really hot area like i do i would put a towel or something under the saver just to make sure it doesn't stick to your leather
After learning my lesson the hard way on my previous car, I decided to start off on the right foot with my new car, and get a Seat Saver as soon as possible. After just a day of going "naked", my leather seats were already showing pinch marks.My interior is black and tan, and I picked up theBritax Parkway SGL Booster Seat, Nutmeg, which matched brilliantly. I thought this would be pretty close, but the color isn't really beige or grey, despite the box showing a color that actually comes reasonably close to matching my actual interior."So the color's weird? Big deal." Besides the color, the product itself just screams of mediocrity. Getting the base portion on was no problem, and it does a fine job of protecting my seats. The back part, though, is something you basically have to align against the car seat and child seat when you install it. Unless you're driving an '83 Ford EXP, there's just no way it's going to cover properly when the base piece and back piece are attached to each other -- unless you have teeny tiny back seats.Normally, I wouldn't be so harsh on a product for something like that, but when it costs twice as much as base seat protectors, the back should be as good as the base.This Seat Saver gets the job done, but only barely. And the awful color has me looking for something else to replace it.
This seatsaver has worked great for our yukon. The leather seats are very well protected.  The beige color is great too.
So glad I purchased this set!! My son is very tall, and his feet already rub against the seat at 11 months old.  Hopefully this will prevent his dirty little shoes from ruining the upholstery.
If you have kids and a nice car, buy this.  That's pretty much all I can say about it.  It's amazing.
We installed these beneath our kids' (Britax) carseats in our car that has fabric upholstered seats.  The material of the seatsaver seems to be dense enough to be doing a good job of preventing severe seat indentations.  Unlike other reviewers complaints, we do not have a problem with the seat cover not curving down over the edge of the seat.  It is properly curved in place, and is doing it's job of preventing our kid's feet from dirtying the seat upholstery.  I'm quite happy with the purchase so far.
This is a must for any parent, especially one with leather seats. I have 2 one for each car and it did not interfer with the installation of my car seat base. I wish they had these years ago with my daughter. The time I could have saved cleaning fruit loops between the seats would have been a blessing.
I have 2 of these and they have saved my leather seats from my girls' two carseats. They have protected my seats from spills, messes and dents. They clean up easily soap and a hose. Must have!
We tried to install his under our car seat, but it didn't fit easily under the seat base in our small car, and seemed to make installation more difficult.  Rather than risk it, we haven't used it.
Others comment that manufacturers recommend against putting anything between the baby seat and the car seat. For us, this seat saver doesn't increase the movement of the baby seat in the least. After three years of using this, the car seats are still unblemished and the seat savers have held up very well.
this is a great seat saver.  i have 3. one for each car seat.  it catches all the junk that my son drops or spills, even juice.  it really protects the leather and is a must own if you let your kids eat and drink in your car.
This seat liner is a must for leather seats!  I use it in my Jeep Grand Cherokee and am so glad that a friend told me to buy it!  Easy install and really does protect those expensive leather seats!!
i LOVE THIS SEAT COVER AND IT PROTECTS THE SEATS IN MY CAR.  i GAVE IT ONLY 4 STARS BECAUSE IT COULD BE A LITTLE NARROWER, BUT EVERYONE IS ABLE TO SIT.  i READ A NEGATIVE REVIEW ABOUT THE BACK PART BUT OVERALL THIS THING IS PERFECT.
This really is a "must have" item for a new Mom.  You can use it in car seats, in bouncy chairs, in baby swings etc.  I use mine in a bouncy chair that my newborn would not be able to sit in otherwise.  A great purchase for the price.  Definitely worthwhile to have on hand for whatever baby item needs extra head and neck support.
We have the Graco Metrolite system and our sons little head would flop everywhere in the car seat. We purchased this headrest (and took out the graco one) and now his head stays in place while we travel. I'm very happy that we purchased this one and once he's a little bigger, we'll take it out and put the graco one back in.
This is a very nice diaper bag.  There are some pockets inside to separate things, and pockets on the outside also.  Instead of transferring stuff(wallet, keys, etc) to another bag when I'm not with my daughter, I can use this and most people can't tell it is a diaper bag.  My only problem with this bag is that the  changing pad that comes with it is small, but that is easy to solve by buying a bigger one.
This was a great diaper bag...except that the routine my husband and I developed was that I always ended up carrying the baby and he always carried the diaper bag. He didn't mind carting it around once in a while, but after a while he began to protest that he was always carrying a purse around. :) We ended up getting a more unisex looking model that both of us liked.(Also, this doesn't have a refrigerated compartment, which is important if you're carrying stored breastmilk).
This is a nice bag.  It is ENORMOUS.  It holds everything I could ever think of taking for the baby.  Due to it's size, I usually just keep this one in the car and use a smaller one to carry into places.  Bag is nice quality and doesn't have that "cutesy" look.  My husband has no problem carrying it either.
Awesome! My daughter loves loading it up with dirt. Rolls really well on hard flooring.
My baby originally didn't care much for the constant noise, but the older he got, the more easily he was disturbed by environmental noises.  By the time he was 4 months old, passing cars with loud mufflers drag racing past our apartments would wake him from his naps.  This does not drown out drag racers, but at least the constant white noise allows my little man to drift back into sleep more easily when he is disturbed.We take it with us on weekend trips to lend a more familiar feel to the environment.  It seems to help him settle down and get to sleep more easily than when we forget it.  Also, as an extra benefit, it eases my mind about my baby monitor.  Sometimes my monitor quits working, and with this making a constant gentle noise, I can always tell when my monitor is working fine or when it has lost signal.
We use this for every nap and every evening sleep with our now eight month old.  We've used it since she was 2 weeks old.  There are several different sound options but we've gone with rain or ocean each time.  The volume is plenty loud.  I recall that I'd read complaints from others regarding the sound, but it doesn't take something that loud to calm baby and keep her asleep.  This works perfectly fine for us.  The cincher was that it plugs in and doesn't need batteries.  Great product.
This product has a great womb sound, very clear without obvious loops in the sound.  Only wish it had white noise option as well......
We had twins just over 1.5yrs ago.  We received this as a gift at our baby shower.  Within two weeks of the twins being born they were sleeping in their own cribs and this was on the "ocean" sound.  It has literally been on EVERY night for over 1.5yrs and is still working like new.  We even take this with us when we travel.  I would highly recommend this as we have not had a single problem with it the entire time we have owned it.
Bought this for my boys who share a room. They take turns on which settings they will sleep to each night.  We even take it with us on vacation as it provides a feeling of home when sleeping in a hotel room.
My daughter is 13 months and we still use this every night.  I read a lot of negative reviews about it breaking, making random sounds, etc. and have not experienced anything like that in the 13 months we've had it!  We set it on her dresser right next to her crib and although we sometimes switch it up, usually we use the ocean sound.  When she was a newborn I used the heartbeat but after a couple of months I stopped using that one.  I love this product and would highly recommend it!
When I was pregnant with my first son, I bought one of these for his nursery. He is now 19 months old and it plays every night while he sleeps. He prefers the ocean sounds with buouy. It is very soothing and serves to dull noise coming from other rooms that might disturb him. There are tons of sound combinations, a volume control, and best of all, there is an adapter, so you need not spend a fortune in batteries. It travels well, so we never have to go without it.Now that I am pregnant again, I have a bought another for the new baby. I absolutely love this product. Five stars, without question.
This is a great little machine.  Sure an iphone or other radio could do the job but, sometimes it's nice to have a dedicated device that does one thing and does it well.  The only complaint I have (which is small actually) is that I do wish it would continue playing the same sound after a power outage.  At it is, it defaults to the first sound when the power returns.
I always take the product reviews with a grain of salt, but I clearly should have paid more attention on this one. The sound is really mechanical when you turn it all the way up, which you have to do to hear the darn thing. It also loops, so once my brain picked out the pattern through the  baby monitor I couldn't sleep!
We bought our first one for our daughter 2 years ago and it is still going strong.  We bought a second for baby #2 and have had no issues in 6 months of constant use.  I take these everywhere-- travel, grandma's house, etc and they have seen some abuse from our toddler. It has a nice volume range and gets pretty loud on the highest setting.  Overall, this has been a fantastic product because our house can get pretty loud.  It drowns out noise nicely and we are glad to have them in both the kids' rooms.  Wish I had one for my room!
Several of my friends own this machine and I decided to try it when I was moving our baby into his crib in his room out of our room. It is great, we turn this on to the &#34;ocean&#34; sound and he sleeps so much more peacefully. Noises don't wake him up as easily when we use this. Highly Recommend for little ones!!!! We turn it on and close the curtains and he knows that it is time to sleep.
got it elsewhere, but I love this! It even lures me to sleep. Not a fan of the Womb sound, but the others are great.
The quality and variety of the sounds are great. There are cheaper versions but it's worth the few extra dollars to have sounds that are actually soothing as opposed to strange. It has a number of settings (timed, continuous, combining sounds, even womb sounds). There are sounds I thought would be annoying (like bells) but they turned out to be oddly soothing. I bought it for the womb sounds, but never used it because I liked the others.
This is the only sound machine we use for our son. It's got multiple choices and you can combine them to make a custom white noise for your baby! It stays on ALL NIGHT too, which we needed.
The idea is there... BUT the sounds just sound so fake! I tried to sleep to this last night and i wanted to throw it out the window. I don't expect my infant to like it. Horrible noises. The volume goes pretty loud for a quiet infants room, but when you turn it up the horrible fake noises sound even worse! This is going back tomorrow. I guess i will continue my search!
Wow. My 5 1/2 month old baby was waking up several times a night until the night I put this white noise machine in his room. He has slept through the night ever since (only a few nights so far, so hoping this will last). The fact that it can play throughout the night is key. We have used the ocean sound because our house is at the beach and we know he likes listening to real waves. My husband and I actually can't tell the difference between the machine and the real thing, just the machine is louder.
I purchased this item for my newborn who will be born soon.I decided to try it out since i have personally been having a hard time falling asleep 38 weeks pregnant and all.So I have been using it for a week now.I must say I have been sleeping like a baby ,hee hee I guess thats exactly what I needed it for in the first place so it works great.I usually have to wear ear plugs to block out outside noise that keep me awake all night.When i go to sleep with this nifty machine on I dont need the ear plugs.It just sort of blocks out all the other stuff.It lets you select one sound,you can mix sounds and also put the system on timer (it will shut down after a while,next time you wake up its off).You can either turn it back on or just leave it off.I love it,i hope the baby sleeps as good as I have been :).I would recommend to friends.I was going to get the little fury lamb that makes the sounds but got this instead because it can be plugged into the wall.Can use the extra savings on batteries although you can put batteries in this unit and use unplugged.I hipe someone will give us the little lamby plush toy sound maker but if not I will be happy with this unit because it lets you put batteries for travel.Great for moms,dads, and babies
We've had two of these (lost the first after two years) and have been satisfied overall, but find it annoying that everytime you turn the machine off it resets the volume to the lowest setting and you must click repeatedly up until you think it is as high as you can go (it is basically useless at any lower volume).  And there is no volume indicator, just your ears:(
The AC adaptor and sound selections are great, but the sound is way too low, even on the highest level. I foolishly bought this, knowing that others thought it was too low...but it really is SO LOW you can't hear it 4 feet away. Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me.
I love that you can mix and match sounds with this sound soother - my girls like the womb sounds particularly.  However, this thing is not even CLOSE to being loud enough to qualify as white noise.  You have to put the thing directly into an infant's crib (making the cord a choking hazard) in order for them to even hear it.  If you are like me and need the white noise to keep your baby from waking up from other sounds in the house, you need something a lot louder.
I love this sound machine!! I just bought another one for my other daughter's room because the womb bear by Dex is about dead. I love that this product does not automatically shut off and can run all night because my little ones wake up throughout the night. The sounds are great and I think the volume control is perfect and loud enough for my babies to sleep comfortably. I definitely recommend this product!!
I am a light sleeper since having my children and this noise machine has been my lifesaver.  Before I got it I would always run a fan at night, even in the Winter.  It made my husband nuts.  I bought my kids a white noise machine with a night light, and finally figured I should have one too.  I like this model the best because it can run all night and has a sound I like (wind).  My only complaint is that it's not quite as loud as I would like, but I tried a few different machines before settling on this one.  I actually just ordered a second one since my original one stopped working after 2+ years and after we got back from a road trip where it was in a duffel bag and got kind of beat up.  I don't think it was because of poor quality.
Variety of sounds, useful volume options, and affordable price: this has been perfect in the nursery! The only thing I would change is I wish you could use 2 of the primary sounds together, but you can only combine a primary with a secondary sound. The sounds are all good, though, and not obviously looped.I would definitely buy this again. It's been so helpful in helping baby stay asleep even when our neighbors are loud, or when we have to use the shower, which is directly next to the nursery. However, it was insufficient for a recent thunderstorm, which makes sense. Overall, very useful.
This sound machine bummed me out at first because it was so low.  Once I started pushing super hard on the up volume it went to the desired level.  It's weird though because I will turn it off and on and it goes down again even without touching the volume keys.  I'm happy with it though because as long as I set it to the desired volume at night before bed it works great.
Many different choices of sound. Does not run on batteries, plug in only. I had half of the sounds stop working after 2 years and using it for all of my son's naps and bedtime. I phoned the company and they sent a new one no questions asked.
This bottle system is great for the 4oz bottles.  I had no problem mixing a full bottle and the drop ins are a breeze.  My only problem is with the 8oz.  I always add the formula to the water as you're supposed to but you can't do that with the 8oz.  I have to either used a different bottle then transfer or use something with a lid to make an 8oz.  Also be careful with the liners a box of 8oz drop ins I bought had several liners with holes.  I called Playtex and they sent me 3 $5.00 off coupons for baby magic products, not liners, so it wasn't very helpful in replacing the defective ones.  Also if anyone has tips to make powdered formula in the 8oz bottles email me CJAL7784@aol.com
My doctor gave me the sad news that I wasnt producing enough milk for my baby and that I would have to supplement after each feeding. I had placed this set on my registry because I knew I wanted to pump my supply to bottle feed.  Our daughter was able to go back and forth between breat and bottle at each feeding very easily. It was rocky the first 2 days but afterward, smoothe sailing!These bottles are really easy to clean.The nipples fit securely and I have never had any problems leaking.The drop-in bags are disposable but very, very durable...I give them a good washing, and reuse them!Also, we had Avent bottles too, these nipples were much harder and much longer. Even thought they were "slow flow" the formula still spurted out much faster than the Playtex. We tried going back and forth btwn breast/bottle using the Avent bottles but our daughter would get so frustrated and VERY messy.This is a GREAT set I highly recommend for new parents whether breastfeeding or bottle feeding!!
I've tried nearly every bottle on the market, and while I believe that Dr. Brown's are the best at reducing gas and spit up, these are the next best thing. I love that there's minimal clean up-just wash the nipple and rinse off the nurser and ring and your good to go! The nipples are easy for my son to latch onto and they're also very soft. I love that I can squeeze out the air so I know it's not going into my son's stomach. While I love the modern look of the premium nursers, I've found that the original nursers are easier to hold and don't hurt your hand when you squeeze the air out. So if your not worried about looks, save yourself some money and buy the originals. I dislike that towards the end of the feeding the nipple collapses and the only remedy is to allow some air into it to make it take shape again, it kind of defeats the purpose of squeezing the air out in the first place. I also dislike that the measurements on the nursers and the liners seem to be wrong and I have to use another source to measure before pouring it into the liner (no matter how hard you try, the liners WILL NOT hold 8 oz. Playtex does make expandable liners that can hold up to 10oz, but there are no generic alternatives at this time). It does get expensive to buy liners constantly $$$. However, I have found that generic drop-in liners are just as good as the Playtex brand and much cheaper. BJ's brand (Berkeley and Jensen) Come 200 per pack and cost $9.99, whereas the Playtex liners cost about $8 for 100. Overall this product works great and they are so convenient. I'm so glad that I no longer spend half of my day at the sink washing Dr. Brown's bottles!
I'm a dad of 14 month old twins.  I PROMISE you one thing - these bottles are purchased only by first time parents (like me).  Anyone who's on their second or third would tell you to save your money.I realize that every child is different, and some burp up more than others - but they ALL burp up and they ALL get gas.  Some more than others.Parents get so frustrated and worried about their babies that they try ANYTHING different.  One thing seems to 'do the trick' when the problem was ready to stop on its own.We tried every bottle gimmick sold on Babies-R-Us.  This one takes the cake.  How has humanity survived so long before the advent of disposable liners?  I warn you - your child will 'empty' his bottle, but when you screw the lid off, you will see the bag was no where near empty.  This is because the bag collapses and creates pockets of food that never get eaten.  Wonderful if you're pumping breast milk and trying not to waste any.Since our twins were 2 months, we have been using the plain old Evenflo bottles from any grocer.  They cost about 99 cents each.They work great.  There's a bottle, ring and nipple.  All of the gimmick bottles have half a dozen parts that need to be individually cleaned, or come apart, or leak.Think about it - Playtex, Gerber, Avent, Evenflo - they all sell the same simple three-piece bottle, but they also sell some sort of state-of-the-art bottle that's supposed to cure all of your baby's ills.  Why in good conscience would they continue to sell those cheap, gas-inducing, old-fashioned bottles?  Because they work; because all of the repeat parents buy them; and because all new parents eventually need to buy a bottle that does what it's supposed to.
I have been using these bottles since my son was born four months ago.  I initially bought them because I felt the nipple was more like the breast and I had intended to breast feed.  Since I didn't get milk, my baby is strictly bottle fed.I like these bottles for the convenience factor; they are easy to clean.  Since you use the sterilized inserts it eliminates the effort of trying to get a regular bottle clean enough for baby.The nipples are easy for the baby to latch onto, and because they are soft silicone and designed to be more like the breast, my son didn't get lip blisters from sucking.I have used the original liners and the new disposable liners.  The original liners are very difficult to position in the bottle and aren't worth the hassle.  The disposable liners are very easy to use, but tend to collapse and leak.  This occurs when you have filled the liner, put on the nipple and try to push the air out of the liner by pressing gently on the bottom of it.  You realize you have a problem once you start feeding your baby and you both wear half of the bottle.  This happened every single time we tried to get the air out - without fail...and no, this wasn't due to operator error! :-)If you are looking for convenience, ease of cleaning and/or to transition between the breast and bottle, I would recommend this product.  However, if you want to eliminate the air your child consumes during feeding, choose Dr. Brown's instead.
Iv'e tried the Medela bottles/Nipples, which the hospital said was supposed to be the 'best' for moms who wanted to nurse and bottle feed, and my baby hated those nipples. I tried the Aven nipples and she didn't take to those too well, either. The Playtex nipples I found were much softer than the others and my baby only needed a little coaxing to get her started on them. Now she's a pro!
I have been pumping and storing my breast milk for my daughter for several months.  When it was time for her to take the bottle, she took it was ease.  It is also very convenient to store, freeze and feed her with the bottles and liners.It is the only bottles I use!
These bottles are great as far as not having to clean them all the time because of the liners, but that is about the only pro I found. When you are trying to squeeze the air out (which takes what seems like forever when you have a screaming baby anyway), sometimes they bust and you have to start all over...not to mention a waste of expensive formula or breastmilk. Second, once your baby is down to a couple of ounces left in the bottle, it is impossible to reach your fingers up in there to get any air out. Third, there is no way to heat these bottles in the car. I have a Munchkin car bottle warmer but it doesn't work on these bottles because of the liners. The milk does not actually touch the bottle so there is no way to heat it. Not very convenient for long or short road trips. I switched to AVENT and my baby is like a different baby. I didn't realize that he was unhappy with these bottles until I changed, but I see a big difference now.
I adore these bottles. My husband and I have used these for three children. Reasons I love these bottles:1. For people who don't have a dishwasher (we didn't with our first child)sterilizing bottles is a real chore. The liners in the Playtex bottles come sterilized. It made me feel better and the bottles felt cleaner.2. The bottle shape is perfect for all little hands to grip around unlike the Avent brand which are just huge for them to hold.3. For breast fed little ones I am convinced that the nipple choices give Moms many choices to prevent nipple confusion. I had two children who breastfed and both could switch successfully between the Playtex nurser and the breast without problems.4. They are sturdy and the new design is simple and stylish.5. They adapt perfectly with the Playtex breast milk storage system.
these bottles are great for a few reasons;natural latch nipples-perfect for going back and forth with breastfeedingdisposable/recyclable/very sanitary inserts for milk/formulaso easy to use and cleanwe have avent, dr. browns, gerber, playtex vent air, etc. but these bottles are the best and all we ever need!
i bought this for going out. i use dr. brown bottles when i am home. my baby doesn't get confuse with the two different type of nipples. she seems to adjust to different things so easily. i can even switch her from Similac to Enfamil back and forth.i only need to change the liners and nipples on each use when i go out with my baby. most of the time, she needs about 3-4 feedings during each outing.  i bring liners, 5 nipples and 5 single pack powder, water and 1 bottle. i don't need to carry so many bottles anymore. it keeps my bag lighter and save space.it will be better if it makes disaposable nipples in a cheaper price, then it will be even less cleaning.
I really love the convenience of the Playtex Premium system with Drop-Ins liners.  I can pump directly into the liners, seal them up and then just pop them into a bottle at feeding time.  The bottles themselves have slow-flow nipples, which I find are very easy for my baby to nurse from.  However, this is definitely a "starter" set, and anyone who wants to use this system for all their bottle needs will have to make several additional purchases.  First of all, only one of the four bottles in the set (an eight ounce bottle) has the slide at the bottom to squeeze the air out of the liners.  Even with the short four-ounce bottles, when the liner gets up toward the top I couldn't get my fingers in far enough to squeeze out the air that had accumulated inside.  So, I would recommend buying a couple of more of the bottles with the slide to make it easier to squeeze air out of the liners.  Also, there are only two storage caps included in the starter set - you will definitely need more to amass any sort of milk supply.  These have to be bought in "kits" with Drop-Ins liners (but you'll need extra liners anyway as they're disposable, so that won't go to waste).  However, in every kit there's also a breast pump adaptor included.  This seems like a waste to me since you don't really need more than two of those.  I would like to be able to buy the storage caps separately.  Otherwise, though, this really is a nice way to see whether this system will work for you without investing a lot of money up front but still getting a little bit of everything you would need.
These are really nice nursers, they are easy to clean, use and the liners are super convenient.  One thing I have learnt the hard way though is to rather wait until your baby is born before deciding which nurser to use.  I went through reviews and decided that these looked about the best and bought at least 12 of them complete with liners and everything only to discover after the birth of my little munchkin that they are not the best for him as even with the slow flow nipple the milk comes out too fast for him.  He latches on but doesn't have to suck much which is not so great as I am breastfeeding as well so I need something that he can latch onto and work to get the milk out much like my breast.  I also find because of this he tends to gulp and takes in a lot of air.  There is also a gap at the side of his mouth where milk dribbles out and air gets in.  What I have discovered gives him the best latch as well as minimum air and sucking much like sucking on the breast are the Gerber Nuk nipples.  So I will just keep the playtex for when he is older.  And I have tried the Avent as well.
I put this set on my registry "just in case," although I intended to breastfeed exclusively. When problems arose and we had to switch our baby to formula, my husband went striaght to the store and to our registry and picked up this top-rated set.These were the only bottles we used for our daughter and we never had any problems with filling, leaking, etc. In fact, the drop-in liners are so easy to use that I often filled the bottles one-handed in public.Eventually we bought more of the Playtex bottles (in the 4 oz. size) and many more nipples but I'm glad I had this set on my registry from the beginning. Even if you intend to breastfeed, these are worth considering as a "just in case" addition.
I have used this type of bottle since my daughter was born 14 years ago.  They have changed the design and nipple slightly, but the basic concept has remained the same.  They are the best bottle around to allow for easy transition from breast to bottle.  When I had my daughter 2 years ago, I bought the newer version.  I plan on using them again for my baby due in January.  They can get a little pricey with having to purchase the liners but for the convenience of cleaning, the sterile liners make it well worth it.  Also you can get generic liners at Walmart that are much less than the Playtex ones.  Great for colicky babies too!!!!!!!!!!!
I really want to like this product. I want to be able to use it. They take the baby's temperature under the armpit at the hospital, which is why I bought this one- there are hardly any of them out there. My baby is 5 weeks old and caught my husband's cold. She's coughing, sneezing, and sounds really congested. When I called the doctor, she told me to keep taking her temperature. As long as she can breathe and doesn't have a fever, then she told me not to worry. So I pulled out my thermometer and have tried it all day long. I get the exact same reading every single time. Even when I try it on me or my husband. I find it scientifically impossible that all 3 of us are the exact same temp down to the tenth of a degree. It keeps saying 97.5. Annoying.
This is a good thermometer for baby.  We like it because it takes baby's temperature quickly and is easy to use.  Had another one that took almost twice as long which is tough with a squirmy baby.
We LOVE this thermometer! We had been using the freebie digital thermometer we'd received from the hospital for months and months getting a lot of exercise literally dancing for my son's entertainment that he'd not cry and squirm too much during the minute it took to read his temperature. I had looked at a bunch of forehead scanning thermometers but between the reviews and the price they didn't seem accurate or worth the cost. So I thought to give this 8 sec thermometer a try and have truly been thrilled. By the time my 9 month old son realizes I'm holding down his arm the thermometer's already beeping. and it has always been accurate on me under the arm so I trust it is the same for him. Well worth the extra money of other digital thermometers, and a steal compared to high end ones. I highly recommend it.
I received this thermometer as a shower gift.  After reading the reviews posted here, I decided to find out if mine was accurate.  I tested it on myself against my other digital thermometer, finding 1/10 of a degree difference orally, then against my Braun Thermoscan Plus (finding 4/10 of a degree difference, orally vs. ear).  As my other digital is very old, I don't know if the degree difference was from quality or age.  While the difference with the Braun may seem alarming, it is actually quite normal.  Body temps read differently when taken axillary, orally, rectally, and by thermoscan.  There can actually be as much as one degree difference in the readings (with axillary and oral reading lower than rectal and thermoscan).  Read your product info cards, take a few readings, and realize that thermometers do not read the same temp from different body locations.  I am KEEPING my Safety 1st Thermometer.  It's accurate and extremely affordable!  I will not use my Braun on my infant until she's much older - nearly all pediatricians want a rectal temperature anyway.
I was nervous about taking a rectal temperature, but this thermometer made it very easy. I also have every confidence in its accuracy. It folds into itself for easy storage and protection. A must-have for an infant's medicine cabinet!
This thermometer seems faster then most thermometers I have used before, but I have not verified the 10 seconds claim ;-)  I have only used it rectally on my baby because it is the most accurate way to get her temperature.  The fact that the tip bends is very helpful because babies move a lot when you are trying to get their rectal temperature (it must not be very pleasant).  The thermometer folds quite compactly and the display is very clear and has a light.  This is a great buy.
I am a nurse and love how fast and accurate this thermometer is.  I've taken my own temp multiple times in a row to check it's accuracy and it's always within 0.1 of a degree.  The fact that the tip is flexible and folds up to protect the tip is a bonus.
I really like this thermometer. I my research before purchasing a thermometer before my baby was born. This thermometer works much better and quicker than the hospital thermometers I recieved.
This is one time I should have listened to the reviews.  This is junk and it's cheap. I prefer the rectal thermometer for my baby instead.  The temperature always varies and is not accurate at all.  Don't waste your money on this product.
If you can, buy the double pump. My doctor said it helps in 2 ways, takes half the time and it can even "trick" your body into thinking you have twins, thus making more milk.I didnt purchase the double pump due to the price. However, this mid-grade pump is just dandy for the amount of milk it can pump out in the time it takes. It makes for an easy and quick let down and the speed dial lets you choose how much suction you can handle.Dont get discuraged! The first time I used it it seem to work amazing! I got out 2 ounces in no time flat then the next time I used it it took me using it over and over throughout the entire day to barely reach the 2 ounce mark. I had also read another review that mentioned this: worked great the first time, then didnt work hardly at all the following times.... But dont get discouraged if this happens, it took my body some time to get used to breastfeeding and pumping. Not to mention, it always worked best for me in the morning- OR- if you are really dedicated, use it during the night inbetween your baby's longest period of sleep... you will get a lot more than when you pump after (even if its the morning) feeding your baby.I would have given this pump 5 stars but because sometimes the pump hurts my nipples. I dont have any comparisons but my doctor said when she used the Medela manual pump, it hurt her too.I would recommend this pump and its sister, the Easy Comfort Double Pump.NOTE: Please keep in mind how long you plan on breastfeeding tho. I wanted to keep breastfeeding for 6months so this would be a good investment but once my dr said I needed to supplement I ended up giving up breastfeeding just before 4months. I didnt get to use it as much as I would have liked, considering the money I spent on it. So, if you want a pump, consider this: renting one from your hospital. They ususally run about $30/month and you will get one that, if you were to buy it out-right, it would cost you $1,500. I wish I had done this instead.
I use this pump once a day so my husband can feed the baby at night.  I am easily able to pump out a feeding in about 10 - 15 minutes.  It has a dial for adjusting suction and the pieces come apart easily for cleaning.  It comes with two textured breast shields (1 small and 1 large) and if you don't like the textured shield, you can contact the company for an untextured shield.  They sent one at no extra cost.I've been using now, 1-2 times a day, for 6 months and no complaints about lost suction or anything else.I gave it 4 stars because I put one of the shields in the microwave sterilizer and it bent where I placed it in the breast shield slot.  I called the 800 number and got a replacement within 3 days (at no cost to me).  Great customer service!
We're having a girl, but know that we want more children. I hope to be able to use this set again for either. I like all the parts of this set EXCEPT the bumper that goes around the crib. It doesn't seem to fit correctly where the two ends meet. One is a little short and the other is a little long. However, I talked to a friend who bought a different design by the same manufacturer and she said they are all the same in that respect. I had to modify the bumper a little - the reason for giving only 4 stars - but all in all, the design is very cute and looks like it will hold up well. Also, the pictures do not do it justice. The patchwork on the quilt, bumper, and valance look a lot better in person.
We bought this for our baby boy that we're expecting in a couple weeks and it is absolutely wonderful.  I was scared about washing it for the first time in fear that it would fade or shrink, but luckily, it looked good as new and we can't wait for our baby to sleep in it.  One thing to be cautious about is buying the valance.  The bedding is mostly blue with hints of yellow and green, but the valance strangely is more of the green color and it just didn't seem to "match" the bedding as well because that green just stood out more than I wanted.  We couldn't return it because it came as part of the package.
I just loved this pattern when I saw it & it looks even more adorable in my baby's room! I had bought it before my son was born...we did not know what we were having so I wanted something "neutral" which this was. This is an adorable bedding set that can be for either boys or girls. I also love the quilt that comes with the set...it's perfect size to put on our living room floor as a "playmat".The only part of the set that I had no use for was the diaper bag. (I keep my son's diapers under his changing table.)
If you have a crib that has rounded ends as we do, it is difficult to attach, although we did figure a way.  My son likes to look at it, but it has WAY TOO SHORT of a song and spin cycle.  We took off the music and motor and reattached with just some string.  Now our son is able to watch it spin for a much longer time and he prefers the ocean aquarium music anyway.
This mobile is really cute.  Yes, you do have to put the moon & stars on yourself but that is no big deal. The colors are nice & calm the music is clear. The only negative is that the music does not play for long.  My 4 month old loves it.
Certainly not worth $40. It's cute because it matches my baby's stars/moonbeams nursery theme but it's not the best quality. You have to assemble the hanging moon & stars yourself which is a bit tedious. I have to say, my baby loves looking up at it & enjoys the music. He kicks his legs & coos like crazy. But...the music plays only a short time, which is a pain because I have to keep winding it.  A mobile should have music that lasts longer than this!
I noticed that some gave this pump high ratings but over all this pump gets just 3 stars. Maybe some have had better luck with this than others but I noticed that more people stated that it didn't work well. I bought this pump and right away I had problems when I would be pumping it would fall apart. It made my breasts hurt like they have never hurt before with any other pump Ive used in the past. You get what you pay for if you are going back to work you might want to invest in an electric Breast pump, I bought the Playtex Embrace double breast pump and it works wonderfully.PS When I called TFY about my problems the lady just told me how to put it back together (that wasn't the problem) and got off the phone quickly with me. This went into the trash where it belongs
Same problems as everyone else. I bought this as an "easy" way to pump. I originally bought an Ameda electric pump. I love it, but wound up not using it very often, as it has a lot of pieces to wash and put back together. As I got more and more used to breastfeeding, I just stopped pumping. Well, I'm going to be out of the house a little more often and decided I should start pumping and storing and just wanted to do a little pumping at night before bed.  I figured a manual pump would be a little easier to use than hooking up the electric pump.  This pump is HORRIBLE. It fell apart, and I pumped and pumped and I got less than 1/2 ounce.
This item is perfect for a new baby. Everyone is told not to put loose blankets in the bassinet/crib, but if you are like me, I worried that my baby would get cold. These are the answer!! They are a wearable blanket. I used to put this on my son at night with just a t-shirt underneath. It made night time diapers changes easier too. It is available in cotton for warmer times and fleece for colder times. Available in a range of colors and sizes too. Great product!!!
We loved the first one so much, we came back for more!  Can't say morefor something for baby, than saying we love it enough to come back foranother!
I dress the baby in this sleep sack every night. It has room for him to move his legs, and now in the winter, I dress him in a long-sleeved onsie underneath. (I use the fleece one now and will change to a cotton one in the warmer months.) I like the zipper too -- very easy for diaper changes in the wee hours.
Our daughter started wearing this to bed (night and naps) when she was around 6.5 months. It is neither too thick or thin, and we love the fact that it is cotton. She might not necessarily need a swaddle anymore, but when we put it on it helps her recognize that it is time to fall asleep. Basically, it became a part of a routine she is comfortable with.
I have used the sleepsack's on my daughter since she was 6 months old and got to big to be swaddled.  I have love these.  I keep 2 Cotton ones and 2 Fleece ones in her drawers.  I love the cotton ones for summer and the Fleece ones are perfect for winter.  I always worry about my baby girl getting cold and these are perfect.  It will be a sad day when she grows out of them (she wears the xl now)
I love these Halo Sleepsacks! They're perfect for our seven month old daughter. It's lightweight and a perfect replacement for a loose blanket. Our daughter is long for her age and this size (Medium) fits her well with lots of extra room to grow. The cupcake print is adorable too. The Sleepsacks are perfect too to keep little legs from getting caught in between the slats on the crib.
returning this because it was gigantic.it's also too thin so better for summer use. I bought it for the winter. I love these halo blankets, but these are just way too big.
I have two of these in fleece and I do love them, but my little baby sweats in them, so I tried this one out.  I love it.  It provides just enough blanket without being overly warm.  It's a great summer-weight blanket for folks like me who use AC to blast their houses into another ice age.  (ha.)
I love the Halo Sleepsack. While I never recommend them for babies younger than four months (I'm of the opinion that babies should be swaddled for sleeping prior to four months of age), they are perfect for when swaddling is no longer useful or practical. They are lightweight and perfect for winter and summer, keep little tootsies warm outside of footie pajamas, and come in three sizes so that they are always roomy and comfortable. The zippers are durable and zip from top to bottom, not vice versa, so that your little one can't unzip themselves. My oldest is 20 months, 25 lbs. and he wears a large with lots of room to spare. He is still too little to know how to keep a regular blanket on himself at night and naptime, so the sleepsack is perfect to keep him warm on cold nights and chilly afternoons. They are also available in microfleece, which might be better for colder climates, but even on our coldest nights in Ohio I still prefer the regular cotton - I found the microfleece too hot.
My son is 15mos old and will not keel a blanket on him at night.  This keeps him warm and I don't have to worry about him kicking it off.  Nice and soft, good quality.  I love HALO products!
My daughter loves her sleepsack.  She's been sleeping in one since she stated turning over on her stomach and could not be swaddled anymore.  We put her in a onesie underneath, when cooler will put something warmer on underneath.  We've got 2 so there's always one clean.  Worth the money!
My 20 month old moves a lot at night so he always ends up sleeping on top on the blanket. I like the fleece one better, they are much warmer, but I also love this cotton one. I feel better knowing that my son will stay warm throughout the night with these wearable blanket. This is a must have!
This is a good choice for a lightweight sleepsack.  I love the turquoise animal print and the zipper is good.  I have two comments:I think it is on the small side.  She seems to have grown out of it (in length) a little faster than she should have.  Had I realized this, I would have bought a bigger size.When I washed it, it did that thing where the fabric shrinks a little and the zipper doesn't so the zipper looks all bubbly and puckers up.That being said, we've used it a lot and it's been fine.  I'm not sure when I have to buy again what I will do.
We love this sleepsack for our daughter! She wears it every night to bed. We feel comfortable that she has something on that is like a blanket but safe. The only problem I have with it is that she grew to long for it. The only size recommendation is by weight only. According to the tag she should still fit because of her weight but she is actually too long for it now. Maybe they should switch their sizing to the same weight and length recommendations as many clothing items have.
We use it all the time. Don't need to bother with socks that come off or blankets. It is made out of cotton and is breathable. We are in the next size now, and still very happy. Definitely recommend.
Soft and cuddly. The perfect weight for sleeping.  I buy them in increasingly larger sizes for my granddaughter because they're just right for napping in a heated/air conditioned room.
The weight of this fabric is great as it gets warmer outside. I want to be able to put my baby in a sleep sack, but the fleece are becoming much too warm for this time of year.  The only reason I gave this product a "4" is that the zipper isn't holding up as well as I would have hoped.
Very well-made and soft. These are lightweight and easy to care for. I love the peace of mind they give as opposed to a blanket.
Bought this as a back up to the blue halo sleep sack. For some reason this material appears thicker and it seemed a bit shorter; compared it to the blue halo sack and it's the same length, but there is a difference in thickness of the material. Keeps our baby warm.
We love the Halo sleep sacks. Great as an extra layer for baby and keeps her from sticking her feet outside the crib and getting stuck. We will be using these until she is ready for a blanket.
I love the Halo sleepsacks and this one is super cute.  The little ruffle at the top is just adorable.  I like that they size at the bottom and they are very roomy at the legs. The material is just fine for either winter or summer.  Love these and I will definitely buy more.
We ordered this SleepSack for our two-month old (who's over 10 lbs) and found it quite large, although it appeared smaller after washing it. But it is soft, comfortable, easy to put on/remove and does a good job at keeping her warm at night.
I received the newborn size sleep sack from a friend.  I have since purchased the small and now the medium size.  My baby sleeps better because he is warm and I don't have to worry about him pulling a blanket over his face.  This one is cotton vs. Fleece which is a lighter weight for summer nights that are cooler.
my 16mo son has been using halo sleep sacks since birth and we are big fans.  he's now walking so i thought about getting the kind with the foot holes but didn't like the fabric options that style comes in.  i decided to go with the puppy print as i thought my son would like it (and therefore be less inclined to fight going to bed, which has worked out for us a couple of times!).  other reviewers have commented on the sizing running large -- i love that the sleepsack is so roomy.  the x-large is meant for 18-24mos but i feel like it's the perfect size for my 32-33" son so that his legs don't get cramped in the bottom of the sack.  we were previously using a large which he still fit into but it just looked too cramped to be comfortable.
We love this halo sleep sack for our little guy.  This is the second child that we used the halo sleep sacks on and they have been great for us.  I love that he uses it as a sleep que, when we get this thing out and put it on him he starts rubbing his eyes and yawning.  It keeps him at the perfect temperature and comfortable. He has also learned to stand up in the sleep sack in the morning in his crib without problems.
I really like these sleep sacks. They keep my son warm enough without making him too hot. I also like the comfort of knowing he wont get his legs stuck between the crib bars.
I have been using these from the very beginning and I and the baby love them. I will say though that as the sizes get bigger the zipper seems to get a bit "wonky". It doesn't lay very flat and looks like it might be uncomfortable but my 17 month old doesn't seem to notice so I keep using them.
I wish we had found out about Halo Sleepsacks sooner!Keeps my baby nice and warm, without worrying that she will get tangled in a blanket. Now that she is older, she tosses and turns a lot, and moves all around the crib when she sleeps. Halo Sleepsacks give me peace of mind, knowing that she will stay safe while she is moving all around, and warm at the same time!Also, the great thing is that they zip from the bottom so that you can change diapers in the middle of the night without removing the whole sleepsack!LOVE these, I would recommend them to any new parent or parent-to-be!
Once my baby started rolling and moving a lot these wearable blankets did a wonderful job keeping him warm and safe. He put any loose objects into his mouth so these have kept him from doing that. I'm glad these blankets come as thick or thin so that I can use them accordingly by weather. I would highly recommend them.
This cotton sleepsack is perfect for baby who sleeps in temperature of ~73 degrees year-round. I agree with other reviewers that there is significant shrinkage after the first wash. For reference, the size medium of this cotton sack is similar to a size small fleece HALO SleepSack. But it's soft with a super convenitent zipper so we have already purchased several of the large size sacks.
LOVE:thin fabric doesn't overheat baby/toddler when weather / temperature is warmer or when my baby has a fevermakes it (a little) harder for my toddler to try to climb out of crib (so far she hasn't attempted it)nice qualityeliminates need for having extra blankets in the cribperfect for spring/summer/fall, but not thick enough for winter
I bought one of these after my then 5-month son needed to be transitioned out of full swaddling. I tried a night gown first but the open hem allowed his feet to be free to get stuck in the crib slats and use his feet to propel himself around the crib (horizontal monkey-bars style) and *not* go to sleep. I bought 2 more to use interchangeably. I have not tried the fleece version (it is summer here) but the cotton one works really well for us, worn over a long-sleeve onesie (air conditioned room).
We have had our son in Halo sleepsacks ever since we stopped swaddling him. They are great! We have the velboa and fleece ones for the winter and the cotton ones for the summer. We're going to keep my son in them as long as we can. He moves around too much in his sleep to use an actual blanket. He's rolling all over the place all night.The one thing I think these sleepsacks are missing is a snap tab that would cover the zipper. We've actually talked about sewing one on because our son has become very interested in unzipping his sleepsack to the point where it has kept him awake trying to unzip. Our nephew went through a similar stage when he was obsessed with the sleepsack zipper so I'm thinking it might be a common thing. I understand that you wouldn't need the snap for really young babies, but it might be good for toddler sizes.Overall, we love these and will continue to put our son in them until he'll no longer fit!
I am a huge fan of SleepSacks and after buying many brands I have found HALO to be the best brand for wearable blankets.
This works well for us when my toddler sleeps in his heavy blanket pajamas and we want to add one more layer for him to sleep in.  His room temp is 65-70 degrees and he sleeps in a Onesie, thick pajamas and either this blanket or a thicker halo sleep sack if it's really cold outside.  We live where on the colder nights it is in the 20's outside.  He seems to stay warm and can stand up in them when he wants to.
I love this sleep sack.  It has become an important part of our bedtime routine.  My son knows it is bedtime when we put this on. The fabric is very soft and comfortable and washes very well.  We take it everywhere!  I would recommend going up a size as my son is a little taller than the average baby and needs the extra length.
My headline says it all! This is wonderful. I've been using this since I discovered it - when my son was 7 months old, which he wore the L size.I have no complaints..it keeps him warm and asleep through the night. I'm a happy Mama. :)
Our child freed himself from his swaddle blanket and it ended up piled on top of his face.  It scared me half to death and being a first time mom, I learned my lesson quickly.  I bought 2 of these sleep sacks to replace using blankets in the crib.  I was unsure of the size so I bought the small size in the cotton and the medium in the fleece.  The small still had plenty of room for my 23 inch long child.  The cotton material is light yet warm enough if the room is cool.  The fleece is designed for fall/winter use. Its soft and warm but can still be used in the summer if you keep the air fairly cool. The medium gives quite a bit more length but it still fit him fine around the shoulders.  I see no problem ordering a size larger so you can use it longer as the baby grows.  The zipper on the bottom is a nice feature for changing him without unzipping it all the way, although out of habit I still search for the zipper on the top!  I'm very happy with this product.  My only wish is that they were a little less expensive.
I have sworn by sleepsacks since my 4 yr old son was born.  Perfect weight for summer and winter in IL. My daughter is 18 mos, 22 lbs and still comfortably sleeping in her sleepsack.  Love these!
This product was recommended for us to use with our son.  We've been using the HALO SleepSack since he was a newborn and just getting bigger sizes as he grows.  I wouldn't do anything different if we had another kid.  Great product.
everything it says it is, nice soft cotton, zipper never failed on us.  Kid fell asleep comfortably, money well spent.
I don't know how people get their one year olds to use blankets, so I'm keeping mine in sleep sacks since he regularly does 180s in his crib. This is a nice, light weight. The zipper can be a bit of a pain - I wish it was better quality - but aside from that, these are good. We have two.
I am giving it 5 stars because for what it is, it is great.  It is a thin cotton blanket zip up sleep sack.  I was hoping for something thicker like one I already had that is really thick and warm.  This one is not nearly as warm but I can't give it a bad review because after all I was trying to find a match to what I had and when you buy online it is hard to tell from a photo.Just know that there are thicker ones out there, and this isn't one. BUT it is sturdy construction, the cotton is a very nice and tight weave and it fits my 22 lb, 32" tall baby nicely.  When I use this I use it with his heavier jammies, and I will probably use this more in the spring.
This sleep sack is a great one for a nice light layer while sleeping.  I seems true to size and is made very well.
This is a great sleep sack for warmer nights. I really appreciate how HALO has the zipper at the bottom of the sack when zipped up. The sack does shrink in the dryer but it did not shrink substantially for me. I also have the fleece version (which did not shrink when washed) and the fleece version (same size) is definitely larger. So if your baby wears a certain size in the fleece version but is close to the next size up, go ahead and size up for the cotton version.We use this sleep sack when it is slightly warmer. While it is pretty thin, when it gets more into summer I think it would probably be too much for baby at night (obviously dependent on what baby is wearing too). The thickness is similar in my opinion to a Carter's cotton footed pajama, maybe even very slightly thicker.For colder nights, we really like the fleece version:HALO SleepSack Applique Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Lime Green, Medium
My kid used these for almost 2 years.  They were perfect to keep her warm.  That lasted until she learned how to use zippers
I have relied on the Halo sleep sacks since my daughter was 3 months old.  Great alternative to a blanket, especially if you have a child like mine that moves A LOT in their sleep.  I've used the micro-fleece for winter and the cotton for summer and will continue to use them until she grows out of the sizes offered.  Gives me peace of mind knowing no blanket materials will be up over her face or kicked off in the middle of the night.
love these and still using for my one year old. He does not need any blankets with this on. It keeps him warm all night. now if only it would make him sleep all night. hahah!
I'm a fan of the HALO sleepsacks and their functionality. It could be a positive or negative thing but this 100% Cotton HALO is made of very light and thin cotton material which is a lot different than the fleece HALO sleepsacks that I'm used to buying. However, when the weather gets really hot during the summer, I think this will be the perfect solution so I bought a larger size for my son to grow into it to use it during the warmer months.
This sleep sack fits as expected and it's super cute. The colors are a bit brighter than in the picture, but it's still one of the cutest, frilliest sleep sacks I've seen.
I love these sleep sacks.  I have 2 in each size (one cotton, one fleece) and swear by them.  I like knowing my kids will stay warm and not kick off their blankets in the middle of the night.
We have had our daughter in Halo sleep sacks since she was born.  We had to buy a new one for the upcoming summer months and Amazon did not disappoint.  Soft fabric in perfect breathable cotton.  Exactly what I wanted!
Halo sleepsacks are a great invention, my son cannot sleep well without one and I love being able to keep in in all cotton without the worry of him getting cold.
I have used these SleepSacks ever since my daughter was born. They are a definite night time necessity for us. They keep her nice and cozy without being able to be kicked off.
Here's why I prefer HALO over SwaddleMe...SwaddleMe= I picked one up at Marshall's on clearance for $5.  I was excited how cheap it was.  It, of course, did its job.  The zipper zips up like any normal zipper, and has a material flap to tuck the zipper in below the baby's chin.  I found that the zipper came out though and was afraid with my baby's squirming and rolling on his side during the night that the zipper would poke him.I therefore bought this HALO Sleepsack. More expensive, yes, but will buy another one, if needed.HALO= why does HALO win over SwaddleMe?  For the mere reason that the zippering runs opposite and therefore starts at the top and ends at the baby's feet.  I am no longer afraid for the zipper to poke him.  I also like that this has a zipper versus Velcro like many SwaddleMe ones have because the undoing of the Velcro startled my baby in the middle of the night during diaper changes.Spend the extra money, you'll be happy you did since you'll be worry-free.I bought this particular pattern because it was the cheapest of the ones offered.  It's cute and I would recommend it.
We purchased this sleep sack for our one year old son. We bought the large, and it is exactly what we needed. I still don't feel comfortable placing many blankets in his crib, and I always worry that he gets too cold at night. This sleep sack was the perfect solution! It's light enough to wear in the summer, and has plenty of room for him to grow in to (he's average height for his age). I will be purchasing another for backup.
I love Halo sleepsacks!  They are the perfect way to keep a baby warm without adding blankets to the crib (a SIDS risk).  I have used the sleepsacks for both of my children for a combined total of 4 years.  They hold up well in the wash.  The zipper works well.  When deciding on a size to purchase, consider your child's length more than their weight.  If they are long and lean, consider purchasing a size larger than suggested for their weight.  Also, keep in mind that baby's grow fast.  When in doubt, buy a size larger than you think you'll need.  You can always go back and buy a smaller size, then use the larger one in the future.
I've used the Halo sleepsacks for months. I have the cotton one for when it's warmer and the fleece one for when it's colder. The cotton ones shrink quite a bit. My baby is 8 months old and I already have her in the Large (12-18 month) size. Sometimes she kicks like she doesn't really like having her feet encolsed, but she doesn't seem to like having blankets on her either and at least with the Sleepsack she does't wake up tangled up in it or off her all together like with blankets. Blankets are easier to use though because sometimes it's not fun getting her in the Sleepsack. The zipper is loud so if I have it laid out in her crib and put her in it while she's sleeping the sound of the zipper sometimes wakes her up. They need to invent a silent zipper!  =)
We've had several of these in different sizes, they work great usually and I love not using blankets (fear of suffocation) but sometimes the zipper pull gets a little messed up. Otherwise, they are great, would have given it 5 stars if not for the zipper pull (not the zipper part itself, just the pull)
I don't know how parents function without these.  Blankets are impossible with little ones who thrash around and crawl around the crib at night.
Love it! Must have!It is ok for summer but not ok for cold winter days. you have to buy another for winter.
I can't say enough about this sleepsack (and sleepsacks in general)  this is the next step up from the swaddle blanket.  I love that you can keep baby warm without worry.  Since the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no soft bedding this is the perfect solution. The lightweight fabric of this particular style is great for the warmer months where you just want something light.
This product is of good quality and breathes well.  My son seems comfortable in it.  Nice design having the closed zipper at the bottom.
Sleep sacks are a LIFESAVER! Our little one outgrew being swaddled early on but was too little to sleep with a blanket. This was the perfect answer especially since we had been using the sleepsack swaddlers. Our long, busy guy used a sleep sack until he was at least 9 months old.
I bought one made from fleece first and love it.  Now I buy a lighter material one for different weather.  I have washed it several times and no problem at all.  Zipper is still very smooth.  I bought XL even my son was only 10 months old at the time ( about 18 lb ) but still fits okay.  I no longer has to worry about him kicking off the blanket at the middle of the night.
I bought this for my 8 months old, and I love it! The pattern is much cuter than it looks in the picture. The cotton material is very light and soft. It's perfect for warmer weather. When it is hot in her room, I put her in this and a short sleeve onsie. On cooler nights, I put her in a sleeper and this. I did not have any shrinking, but I let it air dry rather than put it in the dryer. The sizes run large, not small. I bought a size large since my baby is long enough for 12 month clothes in Carters. Large size was WAY too big for her. She fits well in the medium with room to grow. I love sleep sacks and would never risk putting a blanket on my baby. This one was of very high quality.January  2012: I am still loving these. She wears them every night. I have a heater in her room that keeps the temperature from 70-75 degrees so the cotton is warm enough for her. I would get the fleece sleep sack if her room were any colder. My daughter is in the 90'th percentile for height, and she grew out of the medium 2 months after her first birthday. Now she is wearing the large that I bought. I put them in the dryer a few times and never had any shrinking. I had my dryer set to "normal dry" rather than "more dry" so perhaps that's the difference. I usually line dry them. The zipper closes from chin to feet so the zipper doesn't rub against her neck and I don't have to unzip her completely to change her diaper. I've never tried another type of sleep sack, but these look adorable, are of good quality, and are very soft. I've been very happy with them.
This SleepSack is wonderful. Our little guy seems to like it. I like knowing that he's warm w/out being unsafe. It has also washed up really well and hasn't shrunk (at least it's not noticeable if it has). Great price, too.
Our son was starting to roll over and outgrowing the swaddling blankets. This sleep sack is perfect for us. He seems very comfortable in it.The only downside is that our baby is long, but still small. So even this size small seems big on him. However, that doesn't seem to bother him, and he sleeps pretty well in it.
I have the medium in cotton. This size comes 30" long, 12" wide at the shoulders and 21" wide at the bottom. I made sure to wash it how I always wash my daughters clothes. I read that they shrink a lot but I was not about to have to wash this thing "special." What mom has time for that?!? So I washed it in hot water and a regular heat dry. I measured this after. The new measurement is 28" long, with the same widths on top and bottom. So yes, this does shrink some. However, my daughter still has TONS of room to grow! I think the large- even after washing would be way too big. For your reference, she is 8 1/2 months old- 26" tall (head to toe), 18lbs 5oz. That is approx 25% for her height and 75% for her weight. She still has at least 5 inches in length to grow in this blanket, and it is not by any means snug around her shoulders and waist.I do prefer the cotton even though it shrinks a bit since fleece gets SO hot and does not breathe well. I live in south Texas so I guess if you live way up north fleece would be good for the cold months.The zipper is not very loud, and if I lay my daughter in it sleeping she does not wake up when I zip her in. She stays very cozy in a long sleeve footie pj underneath and the house heater set at 70. I do keep her fan on low to keep air moving in her room. That should help give you some idea of how warm but still breathable this cotton sleep sack is! Highly recommend.  Another thing to mention- other sleep sacks we have had did not expand in width at the bottom like these. I love how I can still hold her on my hip even when she is still in her blanket!UPDATE:My baby is now 17 months, 23lbs and 31in. SHE STILL FITS in the medium! This has held up to washing once or twice a week SO WELL. She still sleeps in it every night and for naps most days too! Not sure if I will need to buy the large or not. I may try to see how she sleeps at night just in pjs. However this one was very well worth it!
Our little ones have been wearing these since they outgrew swaddling. It is a safe way to keep babies warm and give parents peace of mind.the fleece is good for very cold nights, but mostly use the cotton ones with pajamas or a onesie underneath.
We went straight from the Swaddleme to this, completely seamlessly. It is soft, well-made, washes well, cute. And the sizing is generous, which is nice since it means it will last us for a while! The medium size worked great for our 3-month old boy, who is tall (25-26 inches), and about 15 lbs. It's actually a little long, but that's fine b/c it means he has room to move his legs around.
My grandson already had a couple of HALO SleepSacks for winter.  This 100% cotton one is perfect for warmer weather.  My daughter doesn't have to worry about her little guy kicking off his cover.  This is a great idea!!
My 17 month old son moves constantly in his sleep, so sleepsacks are a must. This one is nice and light. I use it for nap time and the fleece one for bedtime.
The fabric is nice and not too hot.  My only complaint is that the zipper is difficult to use in the middle of the night.  The zipper is located at the very top of the neck.  So trying to get a zipper going in the dark and in the middle of the night is really annoying.  This is fine for daytime naps and older babies but not for the overnight duty with new babies.
When we were no longer swaddling my son, these were perfect (before it got too warm out.) He liked the confined feeling, because his legs were still in something, it wasn't too restrictive. He wore a regular footie sleeper underneath and it was the perfect amount of clothing. We stopped in the Spring when it started getting warmer and by then he was old enough that he no longer needed that bundled up feeling. I would recommend these to any parent and I will use these with my next child as well!
Our son is tall, and I was worried this might not fit him, but it is very long and warm. He is very active thru the night, and this ensures he stays warm. Easy to launder and dries quickly (I don't use any heat). Love them!
We have two of these and love them.  They are made of cotton, so are breathable and prevent overheating.  The cream color goes with any pajamas (if you are a parent who just can't stand for things to clash, even at bedtime, this matters).  They have also stood up well to repeated washing.  I plan to buy 2 more in the next size up soon, as my baby is growing out of these.
This is a fantastic product and I highly recommend it.  We recently transitioned from swaddling our little one to using this.  He basically outgrew the swaddling and was getting his arms free within seconds.  It seemed he liked his arms loose, but of course we wanted his legs covered to keep him warm.  On the other hand we were still afraid to use a blanket because he is still a bit young.  This SleepSack was our answer.  We use it with long sleeve onesies and it keeps our little one warm, cozy and safe.  The material is soft after a few washings and the construction is solid as well.  Buy this product without any fears.
This Halo Sleep Sack is rough, thin and not what I would expect a baby to wear. The pattern is awesome but the fabric is just awful!!!! I'm sending it back TODAY
Our son was swaddled since he was young and as he started growing we wanted to find something more comfortable for him. At 6 months, we ordered 1 size big as we knew he would outgrow them quickly. They fit him very well and I still continue to use them (even at 12 months).
We use it nightly and for all naps. It is a good thickness - not too hot for my son while he sleeps.
We are not using blankets in the baby's crib due to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations, and because he moves around too much for a blanket to be effective all night long.  We've been using HALO SleepSacks since the day our baby was born - the hospital gave him a swaddle-variety HALO SleepSack.  These things are great.  They do not restrict movement (my 10.5-month-old can crawl, stand, and even cruise in his SleepSack), and they do a great job of keeping him warm all night long.
Great. Good size for our 9 month old son. Not too thick, but nice and warm. Zipper worked well in two that we bought, but started to break in the third one. Overall very happy.
We were gifted fleece sleep sacks and after my daughter felt really warm one night, I realized it was time to buy light, cotton ones. This was even better than I expected. So soft and so light. Hard to explain but it's just perfect for summer and warmer weather. I'll be buying more for sure.
My daughter could get out of any swaddle, no matter how tight we made it! This worked great since she seemed to not like being bundled/swaddled tight, but still wanted to feel 'cuddled'. I think we used this size Medium when she was about 6 months old(?) and worked great until she outgrew it! Seemed to help her sleep better.
The Medium sleep sack is just what I needed for the upcoming Fall nights. Pefect for over onesies or light pjs. For some reason mine arrived and smelled like gasoline. I had to wash it three times to get the smell out.
I own three halo sleep sacks, a cream colored one, the one with sweet peas on it, and this baby blue one. The other two are wonderful, soft and cozy....but for whatever reason this blue color feels terrible!! It's rough and scratchy and stiff, I hate touching it so we've stopped using it. I know, it makes no sense. But if you're thinking of picking this blue one maybe pick another color or a blue one from another listing instead.
My little one can't stand blankets. The only use he has for them is to twist them up and chew on them. That's fine and all, except that he wakes up cold because he has no blanket covering anything but his face and hands.Not only can he not kick off this sleepsack, if i put a blanket over it, he can't kick that off either.These are lovely and soft, and zip top-to-bottom so there's no annoying zipper pull under your baby's chin.They seem to run slightly small in length and large in neck opening, but that might be because my kid walks his legs up the front of the sleepsack until he's pulling the neck down enough that he can sometimes pop an arm through it. He doesn't seem to mind that, it's neither dangerous nor uncomfortable, i just wish the neck hole was a shade smaller.
Our 5-month-old has been using the Halo cotton sleepsacks for about a month now.  They're soft and warm and have washed pretty well, although they did shrink a bit at first.  It's nice to know that our son can't kick these off in the night- he usually wriggles out of regular blankets within 2 or 3 minutes.
I love the Halo sleeper sacks. They wash up nice, they fit great on my kids, and of course they are cute. I would recommend anyone with small children buy these for their children. It keeps them covered without the risk of blankets...and if your kids are anything like mine...they move so much that a blanket would stay on them anyway.
Not only is your baby safer wearing a blanket instead of being wrapped in one, but it stays on, so you know they are going to stay warm! I love this and I have bought at least one in every size we needed so far. I highly recommend this product and I like to give them as gifts as well.
Good color and cute design. Fits my 7 month old with room to spare. I would buy this product again.
Halo sleepsacks are quality and the zipper has never come apart during the night (which I can't way for our Aden and Anais ones, even though I love the fabric of those). The cotton ones are great for warmer nights and daytime naps. We use the fleece ones for cooler nights.
This is perfect for my 5 month old grandson to use when he goes to sleep at night. His arms are free but he can't maneuver his legs so that they wind up between the slats of the crib. The material is comfortable, and this is very easy to take on and off. This is much safer and effective than a standard blanket since there is no chance of your child kicking it off or having a blanket wind up covering their face.
I purchased this because my little guy was breaking out of the swaddle and I didn't feel comfortable with him and a free blanket in the crib. The sleep sack keeps him warm, and he sleeps well. We don't use it in the summer because he sleeps fine in just pjs. I will use it again this winter. My little guy was using this at 4 months.
I like these sleep sacks quite a bit. You can get different weights, which keep your baby warmer (obviously).Here are my two little gripes:1. My baby is tall and skinny. She is 1 year now, and 21# but 32 inches. Therefore, she's pushing the upper limits on the length of the large but not even in the weight range. The consequence is that the sack is gappy across her chest but her toes are near the end of the blanket.2. I would love a 2-way zipper. It was a bit of a pain trying to zip her into the sack when she had already fallen asleep. It was dark and I fumbled with the zipper, trying not to wake the baby. haha. Not a huge gripe, but still takes it down a notch from ideal.Otherwise, I like them a lot! My daughter is kept warm but not overheated and she can move around comfortably. The quality is great.Definitely recommend if your baby is right in the middle of the range or a little chunky as there is a lot of room in there!
These cotton SleepSacks are great for warmer months when baby just needs a thin extra layer for bed time.  My little guy is comfortable in these, so I bought them in every size.
This is the second halo summer-weight sleep sack that I have purchased.  The material is nice and soft and holds up well to being washed and dried, and the item is about half the price of a grow bag, more stretchy and easier to maintain.  I find that, when baby wears them with cotton footie pjs, the weight is more than sufficient for a Mediterranean winter (around 18 degrees Celsius in the house at night).
I use it over a onesie in summer, and over fleece footed jammies in winter. They are good quality and last forever through a bizillion washes. No worries about baby suffocating, as they fit great.
I really like these especially since they are cotton and much better quality than the carters sleeping bags.The drawbacks: Zippers tent to rip after a little while and not warm enough in winter.
Good length and size for my big 6 month baby. Lightweight cotton sack keeps him comfortable over pajamas during summer months without using a blanket.
When our son started escaping from the receiving blankets we'd swaddle him in, we started using a sleep sack.  It took a couple of weeks for him to adjust to it, but now he loves it and goes right to sleep when we put it on him and set him in the crib.  He is 30 inches tall and about to outgrow the medium, so we have a large ready for him.  He rolls all over the crib during the night and the sleep sack moves with him.  It is never pulled tight or twisted.  We dress him in something with long sleeves so that his arms stay warm and during the colder winter nights we added "No-Scratch Mittens" from Babies R Us to keep his hands warm.  When our son was still in a bassinet, the sleep sack worked well with a sleep positioner to keep him on his back.  When swaddled he would scoot out of the positioner, but with the sleep sack his arms were above the positioner and he stayed in place.  I've washed both a cotton and a fleece sleep sack dozens of times and they held up great.  There's no shrinking, fading or unraveling and the zippers still work perfectly.  The sleep sack is the perfect way for our son to stay warm at night and I am so glad I have it.
most of these sell in sizes 0-9 months - I was so pleased to find an x-l - my baby is big - 22lb at 6 months and I love these sleep blankets - it is very roomy - I could have used a large for him now, but it works and it will last a while. Well worth the price.
our 16-month old kicks and moves a lot when he sleeps so this sack keeps him warm throughout the night. It is the second one we buy of this kind (had a smaller size) and we are all very happy. It is lightweight that he won't overheat yet thick enough that it keeps him warm. good quality, holds up pretty well with frequent washing at high temp. My son was swaddled for 4 months then transitioned to sleep sacks and I plan on using them for a while.
I didn't know these existed until my friend recommended one. I am glad, these are really nice especially in winter. I can't imagine living without it.
This is a great wipes warmer and the wipes do not brown.  We have no problem with water spilling when we open the warmer.  Our daughter loves having the warm wipes.  Just be sure to keep water in the machine as the directions indicate.
All babies are unique, so I wouldn't buy this until you have your baby home and see how he/she likes cold wipes, but our daughter HATED having cold wipes used, so we are very glad to have this.  The other reviewers are spot on that the wipes are not warm by the time they get to baby, but they aren't cold either, and there is a huge difference on the east coast when the house gets cold :)  More important, our baby is happier now and doesn't cry when we change her, which is well worth the price to us.
The product as promised keeps the wipes warm. But there is a problem with the warmer the lids keeps popping up and doesn't stay closed. Since the lids always opens on its own I have drives bunch of packages of wipes!Because of the problem with self opening lid, I wouldn't recommend this product!
I wasn't going to get a wipes warmer when I first found out I was pregnant, but I am glad I did. You do have to keep replacing the antibacterial cushion in there every few weeks and I found Amazon had the best deal for a pack of three. The only downside to a wipe warmer is that if you don't use the wipe right after you take it out of the warmer, the wipes get cold pretty quickly. As the boys got older, they wiggled a lot more during changing so sometimes we had to wait a few moments to get them back on center after we had already pulled the wipes out. Every change started with a cold wipe after the boys were about 8 months old. We unplugged it and just use it as a wipe holder.
My Mom bought this one for me when my second child was about to be born.  It works really good there is only a few draw backs.  I noticed that when I use Huggie wipes they dry out the bottom pad in a day or two, they soak up all the moisture, are very soggy so they tear, and they don't draw thru the top flap, you have to open the lid.  I haven't tried Pampers wipes in it so I don't know how well they work.  I do know that the Parent's Choice brand (at Walmart) works really well with this warmer, they draw thru the top and such, but you can only fit 80 count wipes in or it causes the lid to not shut properly and they don't dispense for the next 10 to 20 wipes when you use more.  I also noticed when the Huggies dried out the pad the warmer didn't warm the wipes anymore.  This warmer did fit great on the Munchkin diaper duty organizer.
Highly recommend to anyone.  Easy to use, read instruction manual.  Keep pad moist with water.  Much better on baby's bottom than a cold wipe, especially in winter.
I purchased this item thinking it would be perfect for those late night diaper changes.  I still think wipes warmers are a good idea, just not this one! This warmer heats from the bottom. I quickly noticed the wipes at the bottom were warmer than the ones at the top. I also noticed that the wipes at the top were a bit dried out and soapy feeling. I returned the warmer and found the PERFECT warmer at a TARGET store.  The target warmer heats from the top to the bottom, which keeps the top wipes moist and warm, just as they should be.  It was a little cheaper in price and it has a lid lock that the other didn't have.  All around it is a better purchase!
Got first unit as a hand me down from friend. It died after 1 year of use&#8230;..  I liked it a lot so I got an identical for the replacement.I like that light is not bright ( bought another unit but the light was attracting my son&#8217;s attention and he was constantly trying to reach it).
We didn't think about waking up baby more or startling him with cold wipes until a friend mentioned it.  This warmer is great for avoiding that.  We have yet to run in to any issues with wipes being discolored.  It is best to buy namebrand wipes though for this because for some reason, a few off brands we have purchased don't really work well with the pull-through.  And the moisture pad at the bottom lasted us 3 months, as it stated it would, before it became hard and a little discolored.  We just went on our first trip with baby boy and we definitely missed having his wipes warm in the middle of the night :)
This does what it is supposed to. Nothing to fancy but it gets the job done. The only thing I have to say is they recommend replacing the pad but honestly I just re-wet the same one that came with it and it has done just fine for 5 months now.
I had this for less than a month before it broke. It's really easy to use and they did the job, but it broke so quick and I have no idea why. I would recommend buying a product with more quality than this, it's worth it. Thank God that it's the summer time now, so my son doesn't really need warm wipes for now.
The wipe warmer case failed to close after 5 months of normal use. We have to use a paper weight to keep it down. I truly wish that this product is more durable.And on a related topic - the warmer pad:I would like to let you know that it's the second time I noticed mold growth on the pillow. I've owned the warmer for the past 9 months. It's being used as instructed. The current one is not due for replacement till January 4th while I found the mold on December 14th. The pad also turns yellow, slimy and slippery and have a smell after a month. It's very disappointing to have a mold problem with the warmer as it's a product for little babies. Babies could possibly get very sick from this.
This wipe warmer does an awesome job keeping wet wipes warm and moist. It does not work with huggies but does work with all Pampers wipes. This doesn't bother us because we prefer pampers. The wipes aren't super warm but not cold either by the time they reach little man. It is far more functional than using the disposable container wipes come in. We have 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. So worth the money!
I bought this because the winter I had my first born the wipes were always so cold and he would have a fit every time I wiped him. I thought these would be great but they are not for me. When I assembled everything and put the wipes in them they were nice and toasty warm I thought "perfect" but then I took one out and it took 2 seconds and it was cold, colder than room temperature cold!! I did a test to get one out and put it on my leg and it was like the rapid movement made it colder. I was so disappointed and returned it
My grandson was a little grumpy about the whole cold wipe on the bottom idea. This did work well, he didn't scream when the wipe touched his bottom at least. But honestly, we only needed it for a couple weeks until he decided room temp wipes weren't so bad after all.  I did have one annoyance with it, that it takes two hands to pull out the wipes. That's a little inconvenient while trying to change a baby, so I would pull out two or three and then change him. But that didn't really work either because the wipes begin to cool as soon as you pull them from the warmer.
This thing is awesome.  My baby thanks me many many times over!  It keeps the wipes warm, its easy to use, and it comes with s sponge like pad to keep everything moist.  The pad needs re-soaked every two fill-ups and I would bet it will only last 6 months or so.  I highly recommend this if your baby cringes every time you hit him with a cold wipe!The only complaint I have is the lid latches with a small plastic catch.  This catch bends overtime and the lid doesn&#8217;t work so well.  I just bend it back.  I fear at some point it may break off from all the bending.  So far so good though!
I'm using this warmer with Pampers wipes and the combination is just awesome. The warmer has worked great thus far. It comes with a pillow that you soak in water and place at the bottom of the wipes to keep them moist; after 3 weeks of use and only soaking it the first time it has worked perfectly and every wipe has been moist; no need to resoak thus far. I have not seen any wipes turn brown due to the heat; every one of them has come out normal color, moist and fresh. Overall, it has been a great purchase with VERY easy installation and use. The best part is seeing how my baby boy doesn't even notices when the wipe touches his skin because it is warm and cozy! Way different than using a cold wipe where he flinched immediately and started moving and protesting. A great product.
Our son hated the cold wipes they had us use in the hospital so much that I feared that he would always scream when being changed. This all changed when we started using this wipes-warmer at home. He now LOVES being changed! A definate must for all babies! They should get them for the hospital!
Okay, honestly, with all those baby items out there I thought that this one was really &quot;over the top&quot; and didn't think to put it on my registry.  Well, my little guy had a hard time keeping warm when he was born and definitely hated cold wipes so off to Babies r us went my husband the first day we were home. Oh, what a Godsend this thing is!  Now, regarding the browning of the wipes, DON'T put an entire pack of wipes in the unit.  Just put about 1/3 of the package in and seal up the remaining wipes in the bag (if using pampers, buy huggies first and reuse their resealable bag), or just use a ziploc.  That way, they don't brown, they get warmer TONS faster, they don't dry out, and everyone is happier.  I have found that Pampers have a tendency to dry out faster than huggies if you put in a bunch at a time, but other than that, I love this thing!  Mine has been operational for almost 3 years now, nonstop and still going.  I think this thing is a definite must for every little baby.
We love this!!!  The Huggies wipes will not pull through properly, but we have used Pamper's wipes without difficulty.  I have not noticed any foul odors as some have suggested.  I do notice that you have to watch that the foam pad on the bottom stays wet (needs wetting every 3 or 4 days) or the bottom few wipes dry out.
If you are a 1st time mom with a crying baby and you are doing this by yourself and you cant have 10 eyes, this is a waste of money and I am sure glad I did not spend my own money on this but I felt bad for the person who gave it to me as a gift. You really have to be on your toes about it and who has the time, nevertheless; the ENERGY!
It warms the wipes well (just remember to keep the pillow moist), and I can do a diaper change without fully waking up my baby (worth every penny!).I use huggies natural care wipes and have never had a problem with them not popping up. I placed it directly on the painted wood surface of my changing table, and have not had any problems with heat discoloration or water damage. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
OK, so it heats wipes, and is comfy for the babies, but I hate this thing.The door NEVER stays closed - to the point we always put something on top to keep it closed.I tried bending the tab, and that worked for a few days, but we'd always go to reach for a wipe, to find a dry one because the moisture evaporated, then through out one or even two to et to a 'wet' one, and then the frequency of having to add water to the sponge at the bottom made this thing a chore.I was so glad the day the kids grew out of diapers and was happy to recycle this, I didn't even want to give t to someone for free.
works well with pampers wipes and takes the edge off their coldness which makes our baby much happier during diaper changes
I thought that a wipe warmer was a totally unnecessary product until I bought my daughter home from the hospital and saw her jump when I put the cold wipe on her bottom. Well, that convinced me to go buy a wipes warmer! Anyway, I bought this one because of the good reviews and it is a good product but there are a few flaws. After only 10 weeks of usage, the top keeps popping back up when it is closed, even though the warmer is not too full of wipes. Also, you must add water again to the sponge pack before the wipes run out otherwise the wipes will become dry towards the end of the pile and you end up wasting them.Besides these 2 flaws, the product works great!
We were rather disappointed with this warmer and ended up returning it and getting the Dex warmer which works MUCH better. Warmers are meant to just take the chill out of the wipes but this one didnt do that very well. The lid is also inconvenient to use - you have to push a button to open and close it each time; no easy flipping like the Dex. Not worth it!
It warms the wipes but not much. It could be better. The only down side is that it has to be connected to electricity at all times.
Definitely happy with my purchase of the Lion Heart Wipe Warmer. But, like some other reviews, yes...it seems to work better with the pampers pop up wipes. My husband and I have to occasionally open up the lid to get the wipes to come out. It keeps them nice and warm, not too hot. My 3-week old son doesn't cry at all during diaper changes! We haven't had any brown wipes since we've been using it. I just ordered some more of the "pillows" you put at the bottom. Would suggest this for any parent!
This item is one I have seen time and again on new mom's baby registries. I had this one and it worked for all of three months. we never really used it because just holding them in your had for  a minute really does the trick and you can save the twenty dollar item on something you really need and something that is actually useful. I have 4 sisters all of whom registered for this and all of them got everything on their registries but this item (they all had big registries with at least 89 items experienced moms were smart enough to realize it was a waste of money) Also the thing about them yellowing and drying out is true. and even putting them in 1/3 doesn't help. Adding a 1/2 cup water to it does, but then were back to ITS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!! Just hold them in your hands for a minute and there you go instant heat up. Also if you have a summer baby the wipes will heat on their own with this summer we have been having. And most wipes when you open them up anymore aren't that cold at all.
I had to have a c-section with my daughter, which means we had to stay downstairs in our living room for the first couple of weeks.  We had already brought so many things downstairs that our living room looked like a nursery.  I decided that I really didn't need the wipes warmer downstairs that it would just be a pain in the butt and she could do without it.  When we finally did move upstairs and I started using her wipes from her wipes warmer I realized what a huge mistake I made by not taking it downstairs.  She was always very squirmy when I changed her diapers, so I just thought she didn't like her diaper being changed.  She stopped the squirming when I started to use the warm wipes.  Warming wipes in your hands just does not work.........I tried it when we were out and about. I have never  had a problem with the wipes drying out.  I think as long as you follow the instructions and put water on the pad, you will be fine.  The only problem that I found with this warmer is that it doesn't work good with Huggies wipes.  You have to open the entire lid to get them out.  Pampers work the best in this warmer.  This is a great product and it will make your baby very happy at 3 am when she wakes up and needs a diaper change.  How would you like someone putting something cold on  your butt after just waking up?
I can't say anything as far as the functionality of the product, since it's for a friend and they're not due for another month, but this item looks really nice! They're really excited about it, it was on their baby registry and their friends who use it say it's great!
I only started using the baby wipes warmer during the winter.  My baby didn't seem to mind the cold or warm wipes.  I think it's more of a peace of mind for me knowing I won't shock my baby with cold wipes in the middle of the night when I'm changing her diaper.  Overall, the quality of the product seems to be good and sturdy.  The wipes come out warm and seems to do the job.  I gave it a 4 star only because it made no big difference to my baby but more for her protective mommy!
This product is definately not necessary, but does work great. Before having my little girl I read in a parenting book that newborn girls, expecially in the winter, are very sensitive to cold wipes.  It was recommended that you wet them with warm water first.  So, with my baby girl due the end of November, I figured "why not just register for it".  A friend of mine bought it on the testimonial of her cousin, and I am so happy she did. Yes, it does dry out the bottom wipes, but really only the bottom one or two. You have to keep the moistener pad wet.  I usually soak it with water every few days or so.  I do suggest Huggies wipes, not only because they stay moister, but they are so much softer to the touch.  And yes, the pop up feature is really a bust.  Only the first couple of wipes can be pulled out of it, but the reach-in lid is still far easier to open than any plastic tub or bag of wipes!  My suggestion to you, register for it and if you don't get it, buy it if you have the money to spare.
I purchased this item because of the great reviews it got here, but I am not impressed.  It does generate a lot of condensation soaking the wipes at the bottom too much and making their scent disipate. The wipes at the top when the dispenser was full really weren't all that warm.  I have to say there needs some improvement.
There is a sponge at the bottom of the warmer that you have to take out every now and then and rinse.  Unless you put that on your calendar you tend to forget, and after a while the sponge turns yellow and looks really gross.Besides that the warmer is great and does everything we expect it to do.
I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT THE LID POPS MUCH TOO EASILY.  NOW I JUST USE WIPES THAT ARE NOT LINKED AND LIFT THE LID.  ALSO, THE WIPES ARE COLD ALMOST INSTANTLY SO YOU HAVE TO MOVE VERY FAST TO GET THE EFFECT OF A "WARM" WIPE.
A must have!! Who likes being wiped on the bottom with something cold, anyhow??  Will only work with Pampers wipes.  Make sure to keep the pad wet at all times or else the wipes on the bottom will brown and dry out.
Ok so.... a wipes warmer?? Seriously?? I thought this was the first step to uselessness until I discovered that my dear sweet little 4 week old boy HATES to have his diaper changed and screams ever louder when the cold wipes hit his little butt in the middle of the night. Since getting the warmer he is much more affable about the whole diaper changing thing and is CLEARLY more at ease and comfortable with the warm wipes.If you have an extra $25 in your pocket and your little one reacts the way mine did with the unwarmed wipes it would be money well spent.  In fact it was so great in the nursery, we bought another one for the changing table downstairs as well.Easy to use.  Solidly made and loving it so far....
This warmer is durable and safe. I have plenty of pros and zero cons for this product. The moist pad (goes in the warmer before inserting wipes) helps keep the wipes warm and keeps them from browning and drying out. It also helps to keep the wipes from burning and starting a fire. The outside of the unit is either cold or warm to the touch. Mine was never hot. I used this for my daughter's first two years of birth (stopped using in 2013) and never had an issue. She has knocked it off the organizer numerous times and it did not break, open, or malfunction. We left the warmer plugged in 24/7. We only unplugged it when going on overnight trips. The warmer is easy to open (opens right in front) and the plug is like an AC adapter so you can unplug it from the back of the warmer if you don't want to constantly unplug it from the wall. Ours was set up on a pretty heavy changing table/dresser so being able to unplug it directly from the back of the warmer was very convenient. The warmer surface is also easy to clean and to keep clean. I packed this up to save for our next child. I'm about to order another for a friend! FYI - The portable wipes warmer is awesome as well! I still use that one when we travel. It plugs right into your car's AC plug.
I received this as a baby shower gift, and I have been using it now for 11 months.  It has been very useful; it keeps the wipes nice and warm without browning or burning them.  The only drawback I have noticed is that sometimes the wipes in the warmer dry out a tiny bit.  Still, this does not interfere with my baby's changings.  He stays warm and comfortable, and is not startled by cold wipes on his little behind.Many reviewers on this site commented on difficulties with certain types of wipes.  They said you have to use Pampers wipes because Huggies wipes will not pop up.  I only use Huggies wipes, but I make sure to buy the wipes that fit in "Pop-up" dispensers.  Their other wipes fit in "Reach-in" containers, and each package specifies which type it is.  As long as you buy the wipes for the "Pop-up" dispensers (which are available at Target), you should not have any problems.As a final thought, remember to rinse and soak the pad in the bottom of the warmer every time you fill it.  Otherwise, it will heat up and dry out.  As long as you follow these simple steps, your Wipes Warmer will keep your baby warm and comfortable.
I originally did not want a wipe warmer for my son.... I'm paranoid about leaving things plugged in while I'm not home - especially if there is any type of heating element involved.  When my son was about a month old, we used a friend's wipe warmer (the Munchkin one) and my son really seemed to enjoy the warm wipes.  On a whim, I purchased this one a few days later.... because it promises not to dry out the wipes or turn them brown.  It has a little spongy thing in the bottom that you keep wet and replace which is also supposed to help with the drying out.  Please note, the spongy thing at the bottom DOES turn brown and dry out - you're supposed to re-wet it every week and replace it every 3 months, but I didn't find that it lasted 3 months and replaced it after a month and a half (refills were $8 for 2 - FYI).It takes a few hours to heat - which wouldn't be such a big deal if the warmer held more wipes.... but I feel like I am constantly refilling it - so my son isn't always getting the benefit of the warm wipe anyway.  I like the pampers wipes because they smell good and seem more moist in general, but my husband prefers the Huggies wipes because they're thicker and textured so that's what we've been using - and because the wipes are thicker, not as many fit into the warmer, and subsequently - not only do they get stuck and tear from time to time - but I refil the warmer about every other day.I feel like the design of the warmer could be better - since not all wipes are made the same.... Overall, I've continued to use it since my son seems to like it, but it's still not my favorite item, and definitely not a necessity!UPDATE: Not 2 weeks after my review, I feel like removing another star.  Occasionally, the warmer stops.... well.... warming.  It just turns off.  It's still plugged in.  And every time this has happened, I've had to move the changing table and give the plug a little jiggle.  It usually turns back on after that, but for how long is anybody's guess.  I'm pretty disappointed with this product.  My son does like the warm wipes, but the product is pretty much crap - just keepin' it real!!!
im happy with this purchase my daughter doesn't like to be cold or hates anything cold touching her skin. i bought this before she was born but she came earlier than we expected and the shipment didn't reach our country yet but its a good thing we purchased it before because we really needed it when she came but i wish i purchased the travel warmer as well but i had already purchased a travel holder before but she's fine for on the go but at home i could only use this to change her. some reviews said the wipes browned r would lose moisture or smelled coming down to the last wipe well i have none of those problems i use the moisture pad that come with it and i re wet it like they say to do every wk and it works great. must have especially for colder countries.
Everyone said that a diaper warmer was not a nessesity. I say WRONG!!! My child did not like the cold wipes so my mom bought me this. I thought she was crazy and it was a waste of money but I was wrong. It's great to get a warm wipe out everytime. My child no longer cries when I wipe her. It's a great product.
We've tried three different wipes warmers and this is the best one yet.  We haven't had any brown wipes, they are always moist.  Pampers wipes do work better than Huggies wipes because of the way they are packaged- the pampers wipes are folded into each other so when you pull one out it pulls another out.  The Huggies don't do this and then you have to open up the compartment each time which is aggravating.  Also, you really do have to keep on top of the "pillow"- it dries out and gets brown and hard pretty quickly, about every 4-5 days I've found so you have to remember to keep rewetting it.  The refill pillows are $7 a pack so I try to make them last as long as possible- it's worth it though because there haven't been any brown wipes unlike the other brands I tried.  However, I've been diligent about keeping my pillows wet and I haven't had to open a new pack yet- we've been using the same one for three and a half months.Overall, a great product- the best one I've found so far!
I would of never thought I needed one of theses until my newborn what hold her breath when It came to wiping her with a cold wipe. So I went out my way to find a good one of these online, as they don't really sell them in stores.  I finally picked this one. It works perfect.  I am glad I got it for her and she no longer is bothered by the wipes.
I used this when my son was just born but it made the wipes too moist.  I'd have to dry him off before I put a diaper on or it would cause diaper rash.  I ended up switching to just a regular wipe holder and it's much better.
We have a high need, fussy baby and this warmer gave him one less reason to cry!  He spits up often during changes, and his diaper isn't quite strong enough for him sometimes, so having warm wipes to take care of these little messes is wonderful!  You can always hold the wipe for a while to warm it up, but when you need a warm wipe NOW, this does the job.  For those middle-of-the-night changes it's great, cold wipes aren't good on a sleepy bottom.  As soon as we got this the fussy diaper changes and wipe-downs were a thing of the past!  It is a nice little way to spoil your little one's bottom!  We love it!
This wipes warmer is great! I throw in a package of 80 count wipes and they never are brown and dryed out. You have to keep the ever fresh pad in the bottom wet in order for your wipes to stay wet and not turn brown.
So you definitely don't have to have warm wipes but it is sooo much better if you do.My daughter really didn't like her diaper changed and had peed every time I would wipe her with a cold wipe. We bought this and she stop peeing after being cleaned and now she loves to be changed.It really improves kid's comfort. We love it!
I listened to other mothers who said wipes warmers are a waste of money and regretted it immediately when changing my newborn son! He's a much happier baby during nighttime and early morning changes with a wipe that's not freezing cold. We live in NH and he was born in October. It's not the Arctic but unless you keep your house at 85 degrees or something absurd your wipes are going to be cold and that's a shock to a tiny baby.I chose this wipes warmer after shopping around because of the &#34;pillow&#34; which keeps the wipes from browning or drying out. It really works well but you have to be diligent about rinsing it weekly (I set a reminder in my phone so I won't forget) otherwise they will dry out and brown and you'll be in the same boat as with any other warmer.I find that it works well with Pampers sensitive wipes which is great because I hate the dispenser they come with (there's just a large hole in the pampers wipes dispenser which leads to multiple wipes being pulled out at a time) so this has given me an option to use them up.If you overfill the dispenser or use it with a cheaper wipe they will rip when being pulled out. It creates a lot of condensation so when you open the lid to rinse the pillow and refill the wipes be careful that it doesn't drip on your wood surfaces.
We are a baby wipe using family...they are great for a ton of uses other than baby...and we knew just how cold they can be sometimes. That in mind we decided that a wipe warmer was the least we could do for our little girl.  I had been looking around and doing some research when my mom bought us this one.  I have to admit that she did really well for it to be an impulse buy.  The pop up feature is great and thus far has worked without fail when filled with various brands.  The wipes stay moist and we have yet to find any brown edges.  We love it and hope that our little girl will too!  Also, in response to people not being able to find the replacement pads, our Babies R' US store just started stocking them.  The manager said that it was a new store item carried national, which means that most stores should carry them soon.
This is one of the best gifts I received for my baby shower.  The warm wipes really help to get that "stuck on" poop off my babies bottom without having to rub hard. I use the Wal-Mart brand, White Cloud, wipes with this warmer.  They are pop-up and much softer and cheaper than any other wipes I have used.  Every time I refill the wipes, I wet the sponge, and I have never had a wipe turn brown or dry out.THIS IS A DEFINITE FOR ANY NEW MOM!!!!!
I had this un-neccessary nursery item thinking that my November born baby would be more comfortable. . .boy was I wrong.The first time I used it, I pulled a wipe out and noticed that they seemed a bit too warm for my baby's bum.  I had to wait a few seconds before touching him with the wipe.  This is my first big gripe.  If it was a big job, I had to either pull a few of them out when I started chaning him or wait a few seconds before each wipe. . .a pain!The second thing I noticed is the lid would not stay closed.  So now, not only did my wipes get too hot, but I could not use the top wipe because it would be too dry.  Wipes are not cheap and wasting a wipe is for that purpose is silly.  That was strike two!The thrid and final straw, and what made me throw this money wasted apperattus away was that when I got the bottom of the stack of wipes, I noticed that the wipe on the bottom was brown.  20 or so wipes were not as wet as they should have been, but the last one was fried.Not worth the money or hassle!
This seems like an extra you can do without, and in a pinch or super tight budget..yeah, I'd agree.  But it is really nice to have, especially with newborns who tend to be particularly sensitive to cold.  We have not had a problem with the wipes drying out and we've been using it for 7 months now.  Just be sure to wet the pad enough and it will get you through a whole package of wipes before getting too dry.  Also, be sure to buy wipes that are "pop-up" wipes, otherwise you can't use the top lid on this where the wipes automatically come out, you have to open the whole thing up each time, which takes away from the convenience factor.  Pampers brand work great, they're all "pop-up" style..but Huggies come in both a non pop-up variety and a pop-up so you have to be careful. Buy the right wipes, make sure you wet the pad well enough and this little luxury item is excellent.
The warmer does a pretty good job warming the wipes.  I only fill the warmer 3/4 of the way with wipes.  I also run the white sponge like material (that goes in the bottom of the warmer) underneath a faucet of water once a day - this keeps it from getting dry.
A great product! Babies deserve to be pampered &amp; this is an easy way to make sure the diaper changing experience is comfy!!
This was one of the first things I purchased because I had read everyone's reviews and everyone seemed to love it and called it a "lifesaver".  WOW, what a waste of money!  If purchasing this item make sure you can place it somewhere where there is an outlet, be able to place it on some sort of protector to protect your changing table from water damage, and also be prepared to also buy the travel wipes warmer because your little one will get use to their bottom only being wiped with warm wipes which is not always so convenient if your out and about or traveling.  I didn't know why my Mother laughed at me when I told her I purchased this and now I know why.  Save your money and purchase something your baby really needs.
By my fourth child, I thought this was something I wouldn't need. I didn't have one with the others - but it has been extremely useful and I'm so glad we got it! With my first there were a lot of frivolous baby things purchased that I quickly learned we didn't need, so I was apprehensive to get this with the 4th, but I definitely recommend it for winter babies. It also makes finding and getting a wipe a lot easier, since things tend to migrate in our house. Easy to clean, works great.
I decided to break down and buy a warmer for my third child after watching him react every time we did a diaper change. This is a nice warmer with a light in the front for nighttime low light. It sits on my bedside table and is always at the ready for a diaper change. You have to keep an eye on the wetting pillow at the bottom of the interior. I've dried it out completely more than once and stick it in some warm water and it comes back fine. Not sure what ill do with it once my baby outgrows it but its a nice option for someone with a small child.
I should have written this review months ago, because our daughter is now 17 weeks old. I bought this when she was five days old, because she would scream bloody murder when the wipes  touched her skin. This warmer really takes the chill out of the wipes, and she stopped screaming bloody murder!  I just wish they would make a travel warmer!!!!!
First of all, we cloth diaper and wipe - so this review is based on our experiences using it with cloth wipes and home made wipe solution (distilled water, olive oil, baby wash, and essential oils).  Because of this, issues like browning and drying out didn't really apply to us.My baby was born in November, and it was pretty chilly around here at that time.  We started out using just water and cloth wipes on him, and it seemed to take forever to get the water to run warm in the bathroom in the middle of the night.  I hated to put cold water on his little bum when he was already so upset at the indignity of having his diaper changed.  I thought a wipe warmer would be a nice thing to have - this despite the fact that just a few months earlier, I thought the idea was ridiculous and unnecassary.We started using the wipe warmer when he was maybe a week old.  By then, I thought it would be OK to no longer just use water to wipe him with, so I began using the warmer with my cloth wipes (baby washcloths) and home made solution.First of all, the warmer seemed to warm very inconsistantly.  Sometimes the wipes would just be room temperature.  Sometimes they were quite toasty.  This wasn't a huge deal, as the issue was really to get the chill off, but it did seem kind of weird.Second, with home made wipes, you can't use the pop-up feature.  I knew this when I bought it, so this didn't upset or surprise me.  However, when you open the warmer in the non-pop-up fashion...  as others mentioned, it does leak water from condensation building up inside.  This was pretty irritating.Third, the warmer made our wipes smell downright funky.  I don't know if this is an issue with store bought, disposable wipes, but it was pretty nasty.After using this warmer for about two months, I ended up moving my wipes to an old Pampers wipes container.  I also began adding white vinegar to my solution, which might have taken care of the funkiness issue even with the warmer, but even without this issue, I don't think the warmer was worth my while (or money).My baby has no problems with room temperature wipes.  The warmer might reappear next time I have a newborn in the house, but I doubt it.
Ok, ok, I will admit, a diaper wipe warmer seems like a bit much. When I first saw it in the store my mother and I laughed! She said babies today were going soft! Then my daughter was born, I would change her diaper and she would cry, and wet herself each time a chilly wipe would touch her backside. So, I buckled, and sent her daddy to by the Ultimate Wipes Warmer.Well, all I can say is that I am truely pleased with this warmer. It really does the trick! Now, when I change my daughter, there are no more tears and no more washing the changing table pad either!I haven't had any problems with the warmer burning on the bottom, like I have read in other reviews. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that most wipe refills they sell don't have a layered configuration for easy dispencing, so you have to lift the lid each time you want a wipe. But I really don't think that that is such a big deal. And I would buy this warmer again in a heart beat!
Wow, we should've purchased this in the beginning, but I had no idea these existed in this quality.  We recently decided to switch frome expensive, disposable diaper wipes to cloth with a homemade, organic wipe solution, and this is the perfect container for the little washcloths.  The warmer is excellent; just use your wipe within thirty seconds, or it will cool down significantly.  I am impressed with the pad that you keep on the bottom of the warmer; it retains the moisture from my homemade solution as well as keeps the pads nice and moist and toasty.  Our daughter is really enjoying this; before this we were microwaving several disposables at a time to keep from freezing her little hiney.  Would recommend for anyone; disposable or cloth  users.  Nice for the cloth option, though, because the tub is deep enough and the pad is wonderful.
I didn't have this on my registry because I thought I wouldn't need something like this, however, my friend bought it as a necessity for me.  My son is 9 days old and he definitely prefers his wipes warmed up!  The only problem I have is that I don't have a 'changing station' where I can plug the Wipes Warmer in right next to me, so I have to remove the cord and take it everytime I have to change his diaper.  Since they have included this removable cord feature, I suggest they make it easier to grip or add a handle somewhere, so you can lift it up better.  And be ready to wipe immediately because once the wipes hit the air, they can go cool.
My daughter is 8 months and my wiper is still goin strong. I have the inserts which need to be changed every three or so months. You will need to add water or your own solution to keep wipes from drying out.
I had to buy a wipes warmer for my baby. Cold wipes are just so harsh and especially in the middle of the night. Who wants to be wiped with a cold, wet cloth? This wipes warmer is perfect because it DOES NOT make wipes dry or brown. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because you have to replace the sponge pad at the bottom of the warmer every month. I've had it for 3 months now, and if you wash it once every 1-2 weeks, you might not need to replace it as often. This really is a must-have product. Your baby will appreciate it and cry less when you change him.
I returned my Dex wipes warmer and have been very happy with this Prince Lionheart model.  It takes a bit more maintenance, with the moist pad at the bottom, but in the long run the maintenance pays off.  The Dex model is terrible, and severely dries the wipes out while you're pulling out 50 wipes at a time.This model has a more rigid opening so you are only pulling one wipe out at a time.  It is intended for pop up style packaged wipes (Pampers).  Adding water with each refill will keep the wipes moist and warm.  Leaving the lid open accidentally will dry out the wipes.I gave it 4 stars because I would hope for a slightly better drainage design for the condensation in the next model.
We bought this for our second child because we like buying things for our children. With the second one we almost had everything we needed to start so we decided to buy some gadgets like this. This is really nice. I think if you live in a cold place in the north it's even more nicer.Don't get me wrong, you don't need this but it's a good gift for a friend or like ourselves who love gadgets.I agree with the review of M. Saluzzi "msaluzzi" : you have to buy pampers wipes.
But it is truly terrible. I didn't even get to use it because the lid does not stay on! It keeps opening and the wipes start to dry out. Pointless, really. Just buy a different one.
This is by far the best wipe warmer on the market. My friends have other brands and some have this brand but different models and most of them are no longer working. I've had mine for over a year and it's just like brand new. I recently bought another one as a shower gift.
A wipes warmer was something I thought was totally ridiculous when we were first looking at things for the baby. It just seemed like something stupid that people would think they need, just because it's in all the stores. Then we had our baby, in cold November, and the wipes just seemed like they were so cold on his little butt and I realized there's nothing wrong with pampering baby with some unnecessary luxuries here and there! It also keeps our changing station so nice-looking and organized that we just unplug it in the summer and keep it using it. Just keep refills nearby so you don't have to step away to refill the thing when it empties.
MY BABY LOVES THE WARM WIPES AND I THINK I AM TAKING IT WITH ME WHEN I VISIT MY RELATIVES FOR THE HOLIDAYS. IT IS ESPECIALLY GREAT DURING COLD WEATHER.
It does not brown the wipes, it s very easy to maintain and clean, it does the job jus fine!
This is one of those items of convenience. Wouldn't say it's a must have, but certainly very nice to have. Works well and makes changing baby in the middle of the night less traumatic. Doesn't dry out or brown wipes...IF YOU REMEMBER TO WET THE PAD at the bottom. Don't make my mistake. Also if you have problems with the lid staying closed, simply adjust the "lip", push back or pull forward so that it "catches" better. It's a keeper at my house. Great registry item.
We love the wipe warmer. It is fantastic when it comes to diaper changes because when little boys get cold you get a shower! The wipes stay warm, not too damp, and not to dry until you get to the bottom layer. Yes we do have to deal with the brown dry wipes at the bottom but we keep the wipes in the plastic bag they come in and we keep that bag in a ziplock bag all placed in the wipe warmer. That keeps them moist, warm, and fewer get browned. This product was worth every penny, and ours is four years old and still working GREAT (it was handed down from sister). The best reason to have this is because it is great for babies. Every time I have to use wipes on the go (without the warmer) my son gives this sad startled face because they are cold on his little tooshie. I know I would hate having to use cold toilet paper.
I purchased this item because when I had my last child 10 years ago there was nothing like it.  I love it.  There is nothing better than a warm wipe on your newborn. I just hate to see a newborn shudder when using a cold wipe.  I have had no problems with it.  As long as you routinely check the pad and keep it moist the wipes never dry out.  Not an absolute neccessity, but a wonderful luxury.
I am so disappointed with this product. First off, it doesn't really warm the wipes. Sure it's not as cold as regular wipes but its like room temperature and not a warm room either. My baby still protest when I use the so call warm wipes but not when I dunk the wipes in warm water and then wipe her. I assume that's how it's suppose to be or how it's suppose to work. Too bad I threw away the box and packaging or this would be going back to amazon for a refund. Save yourself the money and just use a bowl of warm water to warm your wipes.
As always, I read the reviews of others before posting my own, so I will comment based on that.First of all, as long as we're at home, I always change my baby's diaper in his bedroom on his changing table. Therefore, my Wipes Warmer is always where I need it. But I must say that even if I did change his diaper in every room of the house during the day, this is something I'd consider buying anyway. It is so nice to have it for middle-of-the-night or first-thing-in-the-morning diaper changes, when my son may not be in the mood to be shocked with a cold wipe. When I change him when we're out and about, he always has a look of shock when I use a cold wipe.A couple people complained about the temperature of the wipes and/or dryness. The directions state to moisten the pad with water and place it in the bottom of the warmer. Then you put the wipes on top and plug in the warmer. One thing I have found is that you can put the pad in the bottom of the warmer and actually pour water right into the warmer, rather than just wetting the pad. I add enough water to saturate the pad and fill the warmer probably 1/4". Then I put in the wipes. Having the excess water keeps the pad moist longer. I do not need to add water until it's time to refill the wipes supply. This keeps the wipes REALLY moist, which makes wiping up baby even easier, and which I think helps the wipes warm up even better.It does take a little while for the wipes to warm up after refilling, but this is to be expected since the warmer can only get so hot or you'd burn your baby's bottom with the wipes! I would say the wipes are pretty warm by the time you get to your next diaper change. And within a few hours, they are definitely all warm. I have not had any problems with the wipes getting cold faster than I can use them. I even place one wipe on my son (in case he decides to squirt!) while I use another to wipe his bottom, and I can go back to the first one to do a final wipe and it still isn't cold.Regarding reviews stating that the inside lid doesn't stay shut...the only time the lid didn't stay shut on mine is when I overfilled it and the lid couldn't shut properly. As long as I don't overfill it, the lid NEVER pops open when I pull out a wipe.Basically, if you use the product the way it was was intended to be used (change diapers in the room where the warmer is, keep the pad very moist, and don't overfill it!), there is absolutely nothing wrong with this product and it's a great thing to have for baby's comfort.
I absolutely love this item. Great idea, babies no longer have to swirm or cry at the touch of a cold wipes at night. The light makes it very easy to locate.
Works great time I answer came with the product. They're for my grandson,  I loved it.  I recommend it. ok
I got this toy as a replacement for my Ocean Wonders Aquarium, which started leaking.  My son was about 5 months old and he just didn't seem too interested in the "dreamscapes".  Maybe he was just used to the sounds of the Ocean Wonders Aquarium?  The motor is rather loud and in order to drown out the sound of the motor you have to turn the volume up.  I started using it without the picture to avoid the loud motor whirring sound.  My infant was not interested :-(  So I got another Aquarium and hung the 2 next to each other in his crib.  He pretty much ignored the Dreamscapes Soother until just recently.  He's 17 months now and is in love with it!!  I'm really glad I kept it.  He has been waking up at 5 am (ughh!) but has been turning on the Dreamscapes Soother and eventually falling back to sleep for a few more hours.  He also likes it at nap time.  He'll turn it on and stare at it until he falls asleep (usually no more than 2 minutes!).  When he wakes from his nap, he turns it on again and plays until I can get upstairs to him (he used to just scream when he woke up until I came into the room). He waves at the toy and says "bye bye" as I lift him out of the crib.  It's really turning out to be one of his favorites!! So I'd give it 2 stars for an infant (motor is too loud to be soothing), but 5+ stars for a young toddler who is able to play with it.
I bought this for my soon to be born daughter and my 25 month old loves this toy. She loves watching the story setting which has her favorite animals.. a lion, bird and whale. She also loves her favorite song twinkle twinkle little star setting. She jumped into bed lastnight and watched it and fell asleep. Also tonight. I am impressed that this has helped so much with her sleeping on her own. I am grateful for this toy!!!
Ever since our baby boy was born (actually way before that!) we've been meaning to get him something by LeapFrog: call us crazy, but the truth is that they just make the greatest educational toys for babies and children alike. And the Dreamscapes Soother by LeapFrog has just proved to us why. It consists of several different &quot;tracks&quot; with music and a rotating visual scrolling through the circular window, to soothe the baby at different times of the day. Needless to say that the imaging and sound are gorgeuos, so even grownups can expect to be soothed by it, but tonight it was put to the test by our little one.Tonight, as we were applying the teachings of the book &quot;Healthy Sleeping Habits, Happy Child&quot; we decided to take the 'plunge' and let him cry out, so that he could learn to sleep the whole night through. 45 minutes into the exercise he had not stopped crying (and our baby, at 4 months, with his 19 pounds can scream pretty loud) and there didn't seem to be much of a light 'at the end of the tunnel'... well, coincidencially, as he turned and was kicking around in his screaming, he hit the button that starts the Soother... and that was it... he went to sleep peacefully. It was unbelievable! I highly recommend it: your baby will love it, and I am sure you and your spouse will too!
My mother bought this for my son when he was 2 weeks old. He would stare at it and the light only option was nice to checkon him. I love that it has different songs and options liek story or songs or music. It sounds nice and works great. Now we wake up to it -  he wakes up and put it on every morning so we hear that over the monitor. I dont have a bad thing to say about this. It stays on a long time so you dont have to keep pushing it to keep it playing. It turns off nice and easy as well. It is colorful and batteries last while in it. I have only changed then once and my son is now over 6 months old. Highly recommend this item!
Our Daughter has loved this from day one. And once she learned to turn it on herself at about 4 months, we loved it too. She will wake in the night and turn this on rather than call out to us and she is only 9 months old. My only complaint with this item is that it takes C batteries and runs out of batteries extremely fast. I understand she uses it alot but it would be nice to not have to buy batteries every week for this toy.This is a great night time soother.
This is the greatest addition to the baby world..... most mothers of those over 5 are jealous that they did not have this!!
I orginally purchased this stroller because the Graco I used with my first child would not fit in the trunk of my new car, but this one fit perfect with room to spare, and the new car is a MUSTANG..That's right this stroller fits in the trunk of a sports car. I have never had a problem with it (although while I was shopping for it, the competetors verson's wheel fell of right there in the store, and I put it right back on the shelf, after complaining of course). It is sooo light weight, and folds down sooo easy. And so many other mothers have eyeballed it and then had to approach me to find out what it was, and where I got it so they could go buy one too.I love it so much more than the Graco stroller I bought to go with the car seat originally.
This was such a great product.  The travel systems are too heavy (especially after a C-section).  I wanted a better stroller than the travel system offer also, so this seemed like a viable alternative for the car seat.  It was.  The seat snaps in easily and the basket in the bottom is huge.
WHAT A BACKSAVER!  THIS PRODUCT IS LIGHT AND EASILY PORTABLE.  I HAVE USED IT FOR EVERYTHING AND HAVE NOT EVEN TOUCHED MY TRAVEL SYSTEM.  MY DAUGHTER IS NOW 2 MONTHS AND I WILL USE IT UNTIL I CAN'T USE IT ANYMORE.  IT IS PERFECT FOR RUNNING IN AND OUT OF STORES AND I EVEN WALK AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD WITH IT.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM!  IT IS A MUST-HAVE!
I thought I'd write a short review as I have a friend who owns one nd I WISH I had gotten one instead of my 'big' stroller.  I got a system-stroller (the kind you can put a car-seat in or use as a stroller), and it was nice, but it just did not get used much.  My shopping-cart cover is what sees the most wear & tear!  One of these snap & go jobs would have been GREAT and I would have spent $50 instead of $80 for about the same thing!  It has all you want while your little one is in an infant car seat, AND you will find that as your baby gets bigger, you might change your mind about the kind of 'long-term' stroller you would like.  I found I needed a double stroller as I ended up with another baby in 15 mos!  Or you may find you will desire a jogger, or just an umbrella stroller later.  The point is, this is perfect as a first stroller and for those on a budget it's a great option - not to mention that you won't have to tote a heavy big stroller just to carry your car seat-bound baby!
It's inexpensive and very light.  I wanted the smallest infant stroller possible so we bought this one.  It folds up very small and we throw it around everywhere and it's still together.  I would highly recommend this stroller.  We have the Graco Snug Ride and it's compatible.
I bought a Siver Cross for long walks, etc. - I bought this Baby Trend and LOVE it for shopping, etc.  A great stroller for the price - everyone should have one.
A must have for any mom that loves to shop and be on the go! I ended up purchasing after my son was about 5-6 months and I was tired of always taking the stroller just for buzzing around town. This is so easy and convenient I would recommend to anyone!
I just put this together and it was not the easiest thing being 9 months preggo but I did get it. It takes forever to get that BT bar off (this is taken off if not using Baby Trend carseat), it took me forever to get it unscrewed but once I did I followed the directions for the Snug Ride (graco) and it was very easy to move the snap bar up to the number "I" position. I think it could lock a little better but if you strap the carseat down, it works fine. I even turned it over and the carseat stayed in place. I think this will be a very handy thing to have once baby is here. The travel system is little too much for me! Too heavy and takes up too much room. This is all you need till baby moves out of the infant carrier!Plus, it has drink holders, can't get better than that!
We got this snap n' go after talking to other parents about the travel systems.  The travel systems just sounded too heavy and cumbersome.  We've been using the snap n' go for 5 1/2 months now and I just love it.  It is easy to use, lightweight, fits easily in the trunk of my car and has an enormous basket for holding diaper bag, blanket, toys, my purse, and shopping bags/groceries.  I can open it and close it with one hand.  I'll be very sad when our little one grows out of her infant seat and I have to move to a regular stroller.  This product has been extremely valuable to us!
We purchased the Baby Trend Latch-Loc infant seat for our daughter and a friend told us we should get this stroller frame. I have to admit it is a lifesaver! It is so lightweight but very sturdy. It's easy to set up and wonderful for all those quick trips to stores. I highly recommend it.
This bottle starter kit is wonderful to have. It also comes with 2 nipples for cereal later on when your baby is old enough to take it. I don't mind cleaning the little parts with the pipe brush that comes in this pack. It's not like rocket science.  My husband doesn't like the tubing, but he's only had to wash them once, so the other bottles were easy for him. Proves he didn't read the directions I asked him to go over. (Great way to see if your man pays attention, give him directions with anything to do with Baby!) I love the wide neck bottle feature. GOD bless whoever thought of that. It is sooooo much easier to poor in breastmilk or formula into these than regular ones.The only drawback you might have is the directions tell you when you add formula, shake before adding tubing to prevent clogs. I have noticed this to be true. Just stir or shake well (make sure you cover the opening and not just put the top on like my hubby), and then place tubing in. Shake once more to be certain, and voila! Feed.My daughter is now 5 months and I could count on one hand how many times she has spit up. Great to prevent colic, (I don't even know what colic is )(THANK GOD!), fussiness from gas, and spit up.I give these bottles5 STARS
When my son was born, we tried sampling bottles from several different manufacturers, including Evenflo, Triflow, Avent, etc.  Dr Brown's bottles really are the best in preventing gas, bottle leakage, and flow problems.  We ended up throwing all other bottles away.  I had read other reviews about the small parts being difficult to wash, but I don't really have a problem with that.  We don't have a dishwasher and I end up hand washing everything.  Each set of bottles comes with a tiny brush for getting into the small spaces for the inner parts to the bottles; and a regular bottle brush works fine with the bottles themselves.  I can wash and fill 9 bottles in under 20 minutes (perfect timing when putting my son down for a nap).  My only suggestion is to bypass getting 4 oz bottles and go right for the 8 oz bottles.  We started off with the 4 oz bottles and now, at 3 months old, our son is already up to 6 oz at a feeding.  So, we had to pack away the 4oz bottles and go out and buy a bunch of the larger size.
This is my daughter's favorite thing to do!  She loves it!!  At first, she noticed the flashing smiling sun toy, then she began to notice the hanging rattles, the mirror, and she even loves the bunny picture!  This is the ultimate play gym, and I highly recommend it!  Plus, it travels very easily - we've taken it out of town several times.  It was a Godsend, and takes up very little space!  That counts for a lot when you are traveling with an infant!  My daughter also loves the bright colors.  Get it, get it, get it!!!!
I started using this mat when our daughter was about 2 months old.  She immediatley noticed the flashing lights above her head and smiled so big at it.  Now at 3 months she starts smiling as soon as the music starts, I guess she knows the lights are fixing to flash.  She doesn't play with the other toys yet but it has been worth it to have already even if she doesn't.
My baby started loving this activity gym at about 3 weeks old.  Now 7 weeks old, she truly loves it!  The mirror, the hanging plush toys that are brightly colored, the music she makes when she plays with these items, all keep her occupied and definitely entertained for several minutes at a time.  Changing the positions of the hanging items is very easy and very stimulating for the baby.  She quite often smiles and coos when she's playing with this gym.  Strongly Recommend.
Our daughter loves this playmat!  She likes the different animals and enjoys "talking" to the baby in the mirror.  The toys easily remove, so you can also attach them to a carseat or crib.  She seems to also enjoy the musical star, but I find it to be a bit annoying.  I wish that it played a few more songs.  I have also noticed that the colors on the mat have faded a bit in the wash even though we use a mild detergent and have a front-loading machine.  I don't mind too much since our daughter has so much fun, and that's what really matters!
My baby likes the Baby Einstein Play Gym.  Like the other reviewers I have noticed that she loves the twinkling musical star at the top.  When my daughter is in play mode, she really gets into looking at all of the different pieces, the rabbit picture, the mirror, the birds and she is just riveted by that star.  Honestly, I don't think this gym is better than any of the others out on the market because we also have the Fisher Price Barn Yard play gym and she likes it just as well.  I would say the advantage to this one is that it folds down to a more compact size and there are no bulky plastic stand pieces in the structure of it like there are in the FP Barnyard toy.I purchased it at a local retailer when they had the price marked down-I don't think I would have bought it otherwise.  It is a little pricey for what it is and how long my daughter will actually be playing with it.If you don't already have a play gym, I would recommend this one.  You will get lots of fun mileage out of it-I would just advise you to watch your local box store for it to go on sale instead of paying full price.  Also, I notice the original list price on this site is twenty over what the local stores are asking as the regular price.
My daughter loves this gym!  She laughs out loud at the musical star!  All of our videos of her are on this mat.  I like it because everything is detchable and I sometimes take the birdies and attach them to her car seat.  She just loves all of the goodies associated with the mat.  I would say that this item is definately worth the money!
My baby has loved this gym since she was about 2 weeks old!  At first, she just liked to look at the red toys - the bird and the ladybug.  As she got older, she was more interested in the rest of the toys, and started batting at them.  She became very interested in the star with the music and lights at around 6 weeks old, and she's recently become fascinated by the mirror.  And I think she's just figuring out that she can get the music and lights started by batting at the toys or kicking the bars.  It keeps her entertained for a pretty long time, so my husband and I can eat dinner together again!
This is a great gym.  Baby loves the music and dangling toys.  Great for development as well.  This toy actually helped my daughter progress quickly through developmental stages.  Love it!
I got this for my son when he was about 2 months old.  Instantly he was entranced by the star's lights and music.  Now, at 3.5 months, he loves hitting and grabbing the hanging toys.  The really nice thing about it is that you can remove the star and attach it to the car seat or stroller for entertainment while out and about. It's been a great toy for him to play with independently.  He can spend over 30 mins at a time playing by himself.  The loops also let you change the toys frequently to prevent boredom.  I would recommend this product to anyone having a baby.  We've already gotten our money's worth out of it.
OUR 2-MONTH OLD DAUGHTER ABSOLUTELY GETS A KICK OUT OF THE STAR.  SHE LAUGHS, "SINGS", AND GETS UPSET WHEN THE MUSIC ENDS.  THE LIGHTS KEEP HER ABSOLUTELY FASCINATED.  WE ALSO HAVE THE GYMINI MAT AND WE MIX AND MATCH TOYS FROM THE GYMINI AND THE EINSTEIN.  SHE LIKES THE TOYS BETTER FROM THE GYMINI, BUT NOTHING BEATS THAT STAR!
A relative purchased the Baby Einstein Play Gym for my daughter when she was one month old.  Being a sleep-deprived first time mother, I was not sure she would even need such an item.  Two weeks after receiving the gym I opened it, put batteries in the musical star, and arranged all the  toys on the bar according to the directions.I placed my daughter on the colorful mat with her feet on the bar.  She sat there for a moment, kicked the bar, activing the musical star.  Then, in a moment I will remember for the rest of my life, she smiled for the first time.It did not take her long to figure out that kicking the bar would make the star play a song for her.  She loved this toy for many months (until she learned to crawl).This is a wonderful toy for young babies.  Some of the toys rattle, and the bright primary colors easily attract a baby's attention.  My daughter especially enjoyed looking at the ladybug.  The star is detatachable and made many trips to Grandma's house with us to place in her pack and play.  I washed the mat in the washing machine and dried it on gentle many time without any problems.I hope this information is helpful to anyone deciding which play gym to chose for thier baby.  You can purchase this item without any fear of buyer's remorse.
My daughter has only been using it for 2 weeks so far (she's 7 weeks old now) and it's her favorite thing we have.  She can amuse herself for up to 40 minutes sometimes!  We've had to wash it almost daily since we started using it, since she spits up quite a bit, but even after so many washings, the colors haven't faded a bit.  It's durable, she loves the little toys hanging down, and she'll sit and just smile and coo at the toys and the smiley-face star.  The lights and music are great, and she loves it when she can turn on the music by herself by batting at the toys or kicking the plush bars.  This is perfect - not just for giving me a few minutes to rest my arms every day, but for stimulating her and encouraging active play time while she's awake.  I love it!
This playmat has become one of several baby items I couldn't live without! We received this one for our baby shower along with a Fischer Price mat, and our son LOVES the Baby Einstein mat and shows little interest in the other one.First, up to about 4 weeks of age, he would lay under it in the 'on' mode - meaning the star played music and lights for about 5 mintues. He would love to stare at it and the toys hanging above him. The only down side is the music and lights didn't last too long and we had to keep reactivating it.Once he was about 4-5 weeks old, we switched to using the 'motion' mode, meaning he had to hit or kick the toys or bars to get the music and lights to play. We lowered the toys with the extra  lincs so they would be within him reach. It's really helping his motor skills develop and he has so much fun. The first time he smiled and laughed was when he was on the mat. He really gets his hands and feet moving to get it activated. It entertains him long enough for me to get a shower, dress and dry my hair.The only down side is that it's not very intersting to him for tummy time because he can't pick his head up very far yet. Still, I wouldn't want to go a day without it!
I have not experienced other playmats but I do know that this is an essential item for your baby. It is excellent for development and by 1 month, they get bored and want to play and this is excellent. I lie him down after a bath or changing and he plays until he is sleepy.I like the colors and layout. It has a good amount of toys to play with BUT:the star with music sometimes goes dead and the music stops playing for a few seconds and this is NEW...the rabbit picture is a lame toyit could be bigger...otherwise it is a great item...I would recommend checking other ones out first to see if this one is right for you.
When shopping for activity mats for out tiwns we wanted something fun, colorful, educational, musical (but didnt drive us nuts), something SAFE and comfy for the babies. We recieved the fisher price musical play garden, lotty ladybird deluxes, carters butterfly gym and this one. Out of all of them this is by far the babies fav one. It has just the right amount of music, toys and colors. And its very comfy for them. We've been using it since the day we brought them home and have used it everyday since. Its GREAT for tummy time. My almost 6 month old is starting to get up on hands and knees and she looks up at the toys and tries to grab for them. With the fisher price gym the parts all seem to flimsy. The lotty gym has almost to many features on it and is almost to busy for baby. Maybe as they get older they will enjoy it more. The carters butterfly gym is nice but it doesnt have all the features the baby einstein gym does. All around this is a great gym and has gotten babies and mommy through a few hectic days. A few ppl wrote about how their isnt enough rings for the toys to hang down. I noticed this to for when the babies are younger and can't reach as high. I just took some of my other rings from other toys and used them to lower the toys. It worked just as well. Just a little hint.
My daughter is almost 5 months and has been playing in this gym for a few months now. She loves it! The mirror mesmerizes her and she loves pulling at the toys.My only complaint - the music has to be restarted too often!
My son loved this gym and we used for his first 6 months (then he started rolling over and would roll off the gym).  We really like the design and the color scheme.  The star on has an on/off setting and a motion sensor setting.  Basically if it is on the motion sensor setting then it turns on when it senses movement from the baby or your hand.  The hanging toys were durable and my son loved pulling on them.
My 3-week old loves the Baby Einstein Play Gym!  She loves to lay down and look at all the colors.  She even kicks the bar to make the music start!  I love it as well!  It allows me to get down on the floor with her and spend time with her!  So far, I love all of the Baby Einstein items that we have purchased!
We love this product!Our son is two months old, and we've been using this gym for one month now. We first tried the tiny love(black, red and white)gym and our son wasn't interested.I wasn't impressed either. It was boring, and had only a few toys. We thought it might have been his young age, but when we put him under this one, he loved it! A friend also recommended we get this gym. The colors are so bright, and our son loves to look at the large faces on the animals/toys. He also loves the musical star with the smiling face.The motion sensor is a great idea. I think that the headrest(pillow) that came with the gym is great for our son who has reflux and isn't supposed to lay flat after eating. It props him up just enough.We use this gym a few times a day, and every time it brings a HUGE smile to our son's face.The mat easily comes on and off for washing too, which is a plus! This was a great gift.
I was so glad I received this as a gift because I otherwise would not have purchased it myself. However, if I knew how much my daughter loved this gym, I would have put it on my registry. I take this with me when going to visit family because it's very easy to travel with and I find it very stimulating for my baby.
Our son absolutely LOVES this play gym.  He smiles, laughs, and talks at the light-up star, and enjoys batting the toys to make the music come on.  The bright colors really hold his attention, and I like that I can move the toys around to change his view.The mat also washes easily and dries quickly.  Highly recommended!
My son loved this play gym as a newborn, and still loves playing with the detachable toys as a toddler.
The nipple is soft and goes about the same distance as a mother's breast while breastfeeding. When, after some serious prior problem with nipple confusion, I was able to breastfeed my child consistently, she started to prefer the texture and flow of these bottles over even the Avent. They were most like breastfeeding for her. They had a slower flow from the Avent. Avent will stream out, even on the lowest stage nipple, these make her work a little more for her dinner, but more similar to breastfeeding.2nd point: What would put Booger from the Revenge of the Nerds series to shame on any other bottle, was barely audible after these bottles. That has been their most impressive point.
My 1 mo. daughter is breast feed but we supplement her with 1 bottle at night. We use these DR Brown wide bottles and she has little if any spit up, no colic and very little if any gas! I think they work wonderful. And the great thing is, I started using this in the hospital (she was in special care for 5 days) and to this day we have NO NIPPLE CONFUSION!!!  I cant say enough about these bottles. Oh, and no need to buy the 4 oz bottles, theses work great for little amounts or big. One of our best baby purchases!
They never leaked. for 13 months! I always hand washed. Then, one day,  I washed them in the dishwasher and put the brown cap part in the bottom with the silverware. They all leaked after that.
During the first two months after the birth of our baby boy, we selected the Avent 4-ounce bottles and nipples. However, our boy's growing needs now exceeds the bottle's capacity. It was time to move to a larger 8-ounce bottle. My wife was talking to a friend and she suggested the Dr. Brown's Natural Flow wide neck bottle which she recommended highly. We bought a three pack for trial. We both like these new bottles. I like the fit and feel in my hand. My wife praises the inner gizmo and says it gives the baby less gas to deal with. Hmmmm. Well, we do have a somewhat gaseous baby and he releases such gases at both ends. Just like Daddy, my wife remarked.I do most of the feeding with the bottle. I like the new larger bottle and it's indentations fit the hand well. With regard to the less gas claim, I can't see much of a difference. I still burp him and he can still usually get off a couple pretty good belches after feeding. I don't mind. I'm trying to improve his tone and volume. As he gets a little older, I'll see if I can get him to burp his ABCs. With regard to leakage of gas from the other end, I can't see a difference here either. The guy is just gaseous, but I don't see that it's doing him any harm, other than embarrassing guests. All in all, I'd say these bottles are fine and I prefer them over the Avents.Gary Peterson
I agree with other reviewers that these are the best bottles, especially if you are transitioning from breastfeeding to bottle-feeding. My newborn took to these instantly and easily gets her formula now from the wide-neck, wide nipple bottles. I recommend the wide-mouth over the standard bottles because the patented reservoir system sits inside the bottle, instead of on top, preventing spills. And because the wide nipples are what my 2-month-old takes the best. We love these bottles and recommend them to everyone!
After trying Avent and Playtex bottles my daughter was still soo gassy and fussy so I decided to switch to the Dr. Brown's bottles.  What a difference it made at 8 weeks she started sleeping through  the nights and was able to drink more because she wasn't filling up with excess air.  I would recommend spending the money on them, it is totally worth it.
I was given a Dr. Brown's bottle as a shower gift and am so glad that I got it!When I stopped breastfeeding I started using 4 oz. Avent bottles for several reasons. First, because I ended up with 8 of them after purchasing other Avent products and second, because the lactation consultant that taught my breastfeeding class recommended them stating they were more like the breast.When I started looking at purchasing larger 8 oz. bottles I remembered that I had received a Dr. Brown's bottle and decided to try it to see if my daughter would take it. The wide-mouth nipples look very similar to the Avent ones. My daughter "smacks" a lot when she nurses and subsequently takes in a lot of air. She spit up often and would sometimes spit up what looked like half her bottle when she had trouble burping. She took the Dr. Brown's bottle instantly and so I decided to buy a few more and switch for a week or two to see if there was any benefit. I'm so glad that I did!Once I got past the fact that the bottle looked as big as my daughter's head (the 8 oz. wide-mouth bottles are very large!), I realized that she was burping much more easily and hardly spitting up at all.I truly believe the benefits of using this bottle outweigh the extra parts you have to clean. After doing some research I discovered that one of the main reasons bottle-fed babies get more ear infections is because of the "vacuum effect" traditional bottles have. As the baby sucks on a traditional bottle they have to gradually suck harder and harder as pressure builds in the bottle. This also creates pressure in their ears which can disturb the fluid balance and cause inner ear problems. The baby also has to frequently break the latch (and the nipple collapses at a certain point of pressure which causes them to unlatch) so that the pressure can equalize in the bottle. This causes them to take in more air. Now, when my daughter is really hungry, she can take practically the whole bottle without ever having to break her latch!I really like the nipples as well. They are much thinner than the Avent ones and mold better to my baby's mouth. I suppose this is because the Avent ones have to be thicker and stronger to resist collapsing under pressure?Others have stated that leaking is a problem. They WILL leak only if:1) you heat them without loosening the top (collar/nipple)2) you travel with them without putting the disk in the top designed to keep them from leakingDon't do these things and you shouldn't have any problems.I definitely recommed you at least try these. I will definitely be purchasing these as shower gifts for new moms! I do recommend the wide-mouth bottles rather than the skinnier ones if your baby has been breast-fed for an easier transition.
Our daughter has severe acid reflux that has been treated with medication since she was a month old.  And she's on lactofree formula.  But even with the meds and special formula she still had a terrible time with gas and spitting up until we found these!We started with Avent and loved them until we found the Playtex Ventaire but Dr. Brown's beats them both hands down!  They stopped her spitting up and gas almost instantly and she is now coming off of her medication.  They work wonderfully!All the pieces are a pain to keep up with and the dishwasher rarely gets the inserts clean but they are well worth the handwashing.  We also had trouble finding the replacement parts for the wide neck bottles.  But we were able to orer some directly from the company.  Also make sure not to overfill them or they will leak.But the pros far outweigh all of the cons!
I am a first time mom and really didn't know much about which bottles were the best. My mom recommended Avent bottles because my nephew did so well with them. So, listening to my mom's advice I bought a whole set of avent bottles...WHAT A MISTAKE. My poor baby was so gassy and colicy. She wouldn't let me sleep. She was always complaining and straining like she wanted to pass gas or burp. After a couple of weeks of this I broke down and asked my husband to buy me some DR. Brown Bottles and after a couple of days of use we saw a difference. The baby wasn't straining and complaining as much. She was sleeping better and she passed gas and burped easier and faster than before. It wasn't a total cure but I must admit it is a big difference than before. My baby is only a month old so her little digestive system is still working out its kinks. I bought the wide neck bottles since the nipples on these bottle resemble the Avent nipples (since my baby was already used to the Avent)No bottle is perfect and this is why I gave these bottles 4 stars:Like most people who have reviewed these bottles, my main  complaint was cleaning the extra parts but I got around doing that. I make my husband do it. So that saves me plenty of time ;)I know alot of people have complained about the bottles leaking when you warm the bottles but I found a way around that too. You unscrew the top a bit while the bottle is warming. When the bottle is warm screw the top back on and no leaks. You just have to make sure that the milk (formula or breast) is not in that the internal vent tube. If the milk is up that tube then you will have a leak. Just watch out for that.Another issue is with the powdered formula. So far my baby is on the ready made formula so formula hasn't been an issue. But soon we will be switching to powdered formula. I liked what another person suggested in one of the reviews about preparing a days worth of formula ahead of time or using another container to mix the formula and then pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles. Now I have a use for all those Avent bottles I bought!Like most people, I would recommend buying the 8oz bottles. I think getting the 4 oz bottle would be a waste of money since the baby will tend to eat more and more as she gets older.I hope this review helps!
These bottles are a true must have!  They are the only worthwhile bottles on the market and are well worth the extra price as well as the extra time to wash.  They really limit the gas intake and we never had an issue with leaking bottles, like so many other brands.  It is a bit of a hassle to get all the pieces in the dishwasher.  I like the wide neck bottles because they are closer to breast feeding and when my son got older, it was easier for him to hold the bottle on his own.
These bottles are the worst.  All they do it leak all the time.  I tried everything the company told me to do to stop the leaking but nothing has helped.  They even sent me new bottles and I shipped the old ones back but the new ones leak too.  Went to the cheap evenflo bottles for 3 bucks and they are soooo much better.  Don't waste you time or money on the hype that surrounds these bottles.  IT is not worth it! Save your $$
I love this set. The washes are gentle on baby's skin and smell great!! The teeny faces moisturizing stick is a must have. The storage tub, toy and wash cloth are just bonuses. This set will last you the first year or longer. I have had it almost a year and I have a lot of baby soap left!! The stick lasted about 4 months and then I bought another one. Great gift for any mom!!
I think that grins and giggles is the best smelling baby product so far.  I highly recommend the milk and honey!
I registered for this kit and got two - at first I considered taking one back, but I am glad I didn't.  It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with, that's months of not having to remember to buy any!I love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom.  The other one is our bib-holder, since we have a TON of bibs. It keeps them neat, all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests.The vapor bath is fantastic.  We just got over my son's first cold and it worked like a charm. He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing! When I caught the cold a few days later, I have to admit, I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion!I don't know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby, but it smells nice.  We've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss, so it must not burn.I definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be!
i love the lavendar bedtime bath, but these are too harsh for babys skin, especially excema... go with aquaphor baby wash.
This was one of my favorite shower gifts.  The carrying case is roomy enough to store all your bath products and lotions and keep everything within reach.  I can easily carry the case in one hand and the baby in the other and not have to worry if I've brought everything I need into the bathroom for bath time.The products included in the case are wonderful!  When I registered for this item, it was more for the storage - I didn't realize how much I would love the products.  The lavendar soap is my favorite (shampoo and body wash)- it isn't too perfumey and my son smells so good after his bath.  Even my husband likes the smell - and he was adamant that he didn't want our son smelling "like a girl".The products are all very mild - a couple of times some soap has accidentally gotten in my son's eyes, yet he didn't seem bothered by it at all.  Recently, my son got his first cold and since he is too young for decongestants, the vapor bath really helped to clear up his nasal passages (and mine too!)  I definitely recommend this product for all new moms
This is one of those new parent kits that really isn't that bad.  You actually will use everything in it in a fairly short time.  Granted it still is cheaper to buy it all individually but the tub makes it worth it.  You can store all of your bath care items in the tub and carry it to where ever you need it.We only use Grins and Giggles becasue the scents are so much better.  They aren't overpowering and they seem to stay with baby long after bath time.  They also don't dry out our skin or our daughters.The lavender set doesn't seem to have a calming effect on our daughter but that could be becasue her and daddy have way too much fun splashing and soaking the bathroom each night.  But the vapor bath is great!  It clears our her little nose and head when she's feeling bad and usually gives her enough relief to fall asleep for a few hours.  But watch the eyes with it...it will burn and they will cry.I also love the Teeny Faces stick for the fall and winter months.  It's a great little compact item that you can store in your bag and use anytime you need it.  Our daughter is bad to get red and chapped checks but we keep this handly and just a few swipes and it's all taken care of.  It doesn't make a mess or smear everywhere which is a big plus.So this is by far the best and most useless new baby set that we got at our shower.  We also got the Baby Magic set but we returned it.  I don't like the smell of that brand and it came with a carry that was not very useful at all.
I put this on my registry so I wouldn't have to worry about buying all the different baby soaps and shampoos separately.  Everything in the set is full-size, which is nice.  The tote is very large and roomy - I've added several more full-size bottles to what came in the original set and there's still plenty of room to spare.  While it would probably be a couple of dollars cheaper to buy all the items separately and put them into a plastic tote, the set makes a nice shower gift and saves time and effort over buying each item individually.
Grins and Giggles, what a lifesaver!  The menthol doesn't burn baby's gentle areas (eyes, nose, "down under").  The night time bath is just amazing.  I highly recommend this for any new family.
this was one of the few ways my daughter would calm down and go to sleep, the closeness of mommy, and the way it kept her in the fetal position, and she could still see what was going on around her.  saves your arms to do other things, more bulky than a snugli baby carrier, but totally different in comforting baby.  i havent used the other more expensive ones, but this one worked great and was easily adjusted for size.
I own this product and the Baby Bjorn.  My baby does not seem to like the NoJo very much and I prefer the Bjorn in almost all aspects.  This product is more difficult to use and less secure.  The position of the baby can shift with your movement (ie: if you go from sitting to standing or if you need to lean over a little bit ); that disrupts and upsets my baby.  Although you can breastfeed in it, I think it is easier to remove the baby from the sling before nursing (but i have to admit that I feel the same way about the Bjorn and also feel pretty comfortable nursing in public).  The Bjorn holds your baby closer to your body and heartbeat and my baby definatly prefers that.  For an infant, the inward facing position of the Bjorn is also more protective from strangers and germs.  Maybe I'll like this product better when  my baby is a little bigger.  I do use it at times when I don't have to also deal with my toddler, but the physical demands of a three year old require too much movement to safely use the sling.  It does distribute the weight pretty well and is a welcome break to the shoulder fatigue sometimes caused by the Bjorn.  It is also better if you are eating, reading, or writing because the baby rides much lower.
My son seems so content when he is in the sling. And it is so much easier on my back! This is a must-have in my book!
I'm not sure why this has gotten such bad reviews.  I have had no problems with it.  I used it for my daughter as a newborn and continue to use it now and she is 18 months old.  I've had no problems with it being too long (and I'm only 5'4) and my daughter still loves to be by my side.  Well worth it!!!
This baby sling has been awesome!! My daughter was 7 lbs. and 19 3/4 inches at birth, so she has always been on the skinny side as far as babies go. She fit in this perfectly from birth on up. I'm 5'10" myself and medium build and my husband is 6'1" medium build and we both were able to use this sling. My mother has used it with my daughter as well and she is 5'6" and a small framed lady.I have used this to go grocery shopping, to calm and soothe my baby, to go on walks, and to be able to get things done around the house. Sometimes when everything else failed, we were able to get my daughter to go to sleep in this sling. At our house, we love the sling!!!!!
Our son loves his letters and numbers and this set has gotten tons of use.  We got it when he was about 18 months so the chewing wasn't as big a problem.  The size of the set is nice because anymore and it would overfill our little tub bag.  Great value as the price was low and he uses them almost every day.
Love these!  Son loves these in the bath and is starting to learn the alphabet sounds and numbers at 15 months old just by playing.
Playtex usually makes the best product. This is our son's first sippy cup and he loves it. Although, when he holds it upside down for longer than a few seconds, it does drip.
My son hated it. He LOVES the Gerber Transition cup (7oz...not the other Gerber cup.) and he's okay w/ the Avent cup. They both have very soft pieces that go in his mouth and feel good...not rock hard! Most sippy cups are extremely hard to get anything out of, this is one of them. Skip it!
First of all, I totally missed out on the Color May Vary warning, and that was my fault.  I originally ordered this for my son but the color that arrived was pink. But, I figured,  we will only be using this cup at home and color really doesnt matter as long as it worked.  It was horrible.  Water was pouring out from the area between the lid and the cup.  There was no was no tell if it was aligned or not because there was a lock sign at the lid but none for the cup.  the spout in itself didnt leak but the cup did.  I was so disappointed with this product. Maybe I got a defective one but I am not taking the risk of wasting my money in buying another one.
We have a toddler and we were told that we just had to get a guard for the DVD, and for other electronic things as well. It seems that babies like to push buttons. Well, that figures. Our boy has been trained with a bunch of musical toys that require button punching and he learned rather quickly. He loves them! It's only a matter of time before he gets to the stereo, TV and DVD player, hence we bought this Parent Units DVD/CD guard.I'm annoyed by this product. It's just a piece of transparent plastic with a couple small velcro straps yet it cost 20% that of the very sophisticated DVD/CD player. What goes? Second, if we use it as illustrated, we will have to remove the guard before each using in order to get the little disc drawer to open. Furthermore, our DVD player is on a small shelf and we cannot remove the guard without removing the DVD player from the shelf first. What a nuisance! I've gotten around this by using the guard upside down. The long flange of the plastic goes under the front legs of the DVD player and the short flange then covers the controls. OK, but we still have to remove the guard before each using of the player It's an annoyance. We're considering putting the DVD player at a higher level out of his reach.Gary Peterson
Good to use for babies learning to crawl. Once they are a little older, if they push hard enough, they could still get some buttons to push!
This simple guard does its job and then some.  Our daughter would not leave our cable box alone, so we bought this product as a last resort.  Installs simply and easily.  We're very pleased with it.  Our daughter can touch the guard all she wants, but cannot play with the buttons on the cable box.
I purchased 3 different guards at once and I sent them all back!! Not one of them worked - this was the most expensive of the 3 and you can still push buttons through it!!I have now made my own guards out of clear dvd cases - works better than this junk!!
I use this everyday since I got them (even bought a second set so I could have more)  we have 3-4 bowls a day so with 2 packs i can set up cereal for 3-4 days depending on everything.  they have enough room that i can mix the water and or fruit/veggies/meats in them.
If you seal the bowl with the lids properly, they are spill proof.  I've never microwaved these or put them in the dishwasher, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it's sealing capabilities, but regardless, it's been an inexpensive way to lug around food for my toddler.  She's a picky eater so I like having alternative options available if she decides she's not in the mood to eat whatever it is we're eating when we're out.  It's also nice having a bowl with a lid!  Most toddler bowls don't come with lids, so I'm just happy to have a lid.  If I'm carrying around a liquid, I'm sure to put the bowl and lid in a ziplock bag just in case.  So far, I haven't had any issues.  8oz is the perfect size.
It is inexpensive bowl with lid. My son likes it bright color and I like the size. It is perfect for snack and lunch pack for daycare. Not so easy to open for a toddler, which is another plus.
These are nice for snacks. My daughter carries these around. They are great for traveling also. I just put the top on and go. We have not thrown them away. Not sure why you would want to chunk these in the garbage. I put them in the dishwasher when they are dirty and I have not had any problems.
Fits 3 ice cube tray sized frozen puree servings to take in the lunch box for school.  Definitely recommend for snacks/meals.
I've been using these bowls for my one year old and they are great.  I use them for snacks, for taking her food to daycare, and for her leftovers.  Dishwasher safe and microwave safe.  I got boy colors the first time and girl colors the second time.  It doesn't make much of a difference to me, although I understand that some folks may not like the surprise.  The daycare loved these bowls so much, they have suggested them to all the other parents.
These are perfect for sending snacks to daycare, using when running errands, saving leftovers, etc.  I like that they are so inexpensive so if they don't come back from errands with my husband, I don't get mad!
These are like mini tupperware.  I use for defrosing my baby food cubes and feeding.  I also use them for packing berries in school lunch boxes.  I use them for leftovers storage too.  The tops seal well (tested my my kids using them to fill with water and wrap them in a present for mommy--they didn't leak!)  I've been using them for years.  I even put the bowls in the dishwasher (top-shelf).Don't expect the lids to match the bowls.  They look cute packaged, but the tops are different colors from the bowls, but you can get two sets to get the other half of the rainbow.
Bright colors for happy kids! These containers are useful, inviting, and great for a house with children! Easy to open, and throw them away when they get scratched up. Great containers.
I use these as snack bowls and for car snack times. They work fine and wash well. I thought it was weird that some of them were girl colors and some were primary but they're just for snacks and that doesn't affect their performance.
Real good product and a fair price! I would recommend it for every mom! It is also microwave and dishwasher safe!
These are great to pack snacks or to freeze leftovers. They are durable, seal tight and are very cute.  I've had no freezer burn incidents and they fit nicely in his diaper bag, the freezer, etc.  Also, my son loves to toss them around and the lid stays put.  Great value for the price!
i love these i usually use it for oatmeal. they come with lids too! i also like the colors they come in.
This is my 5th time buying these.  They are great for everyday use.  I make all my baby's food and they hold just the right amount of food for a toddler meal.  They are comvenient and cute. I keep sending them to grandma's with food in them and I never seem to have enough.  I wish they came in a larger pack.
These cups are great fro cars and small hands.  My 1 year old can easily hold the cup with one hand and take drinks - unlike bigger cups where he needs to use 2 hands.  very easy to wash.  Just watch out - if you kid throws them and they land on the right spot the lid will pop off.  Rare, but it happens sometimes.
Yes, they can open if dropped just right or you have a savy toddler. My 19m old has only ever opened one once and I think it was sheer luck. I like these cups because they are dishwasher friendly (top rack only though) and I dont hurt the bank too much if one is left behind some place. I will note that after awhile it seems like the holes stretch and more liquid can pour out. But hey who can complain with a price like this! : ).. I love love the bright colors and the girl colors these come in too.
This cup was perfect for my almost 3 year old and my 1 year old who is very picky about what she drinks out of.
I found these sippy cups and they have served us well. When my children were infants we used the Gerber sippy cups which worked well but were really expensive. As my children got older but still not old enough to use a cup without spilling the contents, I switched to these.They last with repeated use for several months then ours eventually develop a crack in them from my boys throwing them on the floor. I do hand wash mine even though they state top-rack dishwasher safe and I believe that helps them last a little longer.  They will tend to leak a little if turned upside down and the tops will pop off occasionally. The valve-free design allows for a little leakage but also makes for much easier cleaning.  My sons are at the age where we are transitioning them to regular cups and these are perfect for that in-between stage.These are also labeled plastic type 5 which is polypropylene which is considered safe and does not leach BPA (bisphenol-A) into foods and beverages like some plastics can. That makes me feel better and sets my mind at ease about using these with my children.These are cheap enough where I can keep extras in my car and diaper bag in case I need them on the run. The 7-oz size is perfect for smaller children and the 10-oz size is perfect for toddlers.
I should have tried these sooner because I've been really annoyed with the straw ones. My two year old tends to drop her cup and it's better with these because they don't leak. Now I don't mind her taking her cup anywhere around the home. It's also very good when going out. I think it'll help for when she drinks out of a regular cup.
I have now thrown all of these cups away because I am tired of cleaning up messes. 3 times the lids have fallen off of these cups and has soaked a child, my stroller or my house. I have enough to do without adding to the mess.
I love that these cups are disposable, loseable, and recyclable while at the same time being so durable.  I also love the no valve sippy lid.  However, we tend to loose more lids than cups, (I have know idea why,  maybe it's like all those lost socks out there) so it would be cool if they would just sell replacement lids.
I have finally figured out that this style cup is my best bet when taking milk somewhere hoping it won't leak.  Our Playtex Sipster Tumblers leak a little drop of milk every tip, but not these guys.  They wouldn't be good for little ones who like to pull lids off, but fortunately for us, we haven't had that problem.  Inexpensive and effective..win win.
Bought these for my grandson, when he was visiting. They hold up well in the dishwasher. At the price, not a big deal if they get lost.
My son is 2.5 years old and after experimenting with countless sippy cup designs, this was by far the best of them all.The lid holds very firmly, even when held upside down or even dropped countless times.  We do not even use the optional cap feature shown in the picture.  It doesn't really drip, even when held upside down.  Just be aware though that if it is shaken alot upside down or held upside down where the bottom has contact with a surface, a small amount may dribble out, but even this is extremely rare.  This makes it an excellent cup for the transition from bottle to cup and has worked extremely well for us.It is BY FAR the easiest and quickest sippy cup to clean as it doesn't have the straws or other contraptions to take apart.  you basically just take off the lid, scrub both sides, and wash the cup as normal.Overall, really well designed, yet simple sippy cup.  Sometimes keeping it simple is better.
Been using these since my twins were about 18 months, now 2.5 years.  Great, easy cups.  Easy to clean  - no little parts to take out.  Fine in the dishwasher.  Mostly spill proof.  Still will leak a little if left sideways while very full.  Can also leak if turned upside down and shaken.  We've had a couple incidents where cups were thrown and popped open when hitting the tile floor.  I avoided these cups at first because of one accident like this, but once the kids learned that they weren't supposed to throw cups (18 months), they've been great.  Love that the stack.  Especially with multiple kids, this saves tons of room in the cabinet.  As other sippy cups with soft top have fallen apart, and others with inserts have lost pieces, and others with screw tops or little ridges have grown mold (when left under the couch) that couldn't be removed, these cups have lived on.
I have 16-month old twins who do everything but punt kick their sippy cups.  They get tossed, slammed, chewed and abused.  These "Take and Toss" are very oddly named, because they are the most durable sippies I've found.  The cups don't spill, and their lids stay on through amazing stress.  I have, in fact, "tossed" all my nicer, more expensive sippy cups and now only use these, since they are the only ones I have ever found that stand up to the beating they receive in my household.  They wash great in the dishwasher and seem to last forever.  I've only had to replace the ones I've lost out in the world or under the sofa :)
This sippy cup is easy for baby to drink from.  This and the Nuby Sippy cups are the only ones that my 12 mos son can manage to get drink from.  However, my son tend to chew on the spout, so they will crack after extended use.  Since these are suppose to be disposable and not very expensive, you are not suppose to expect them to last very long anyway.
We just got our third set of these "disposable" cups... after using our first two sets for a little over a year! Our son (2.5 now) uses these every single day, and we just toss them in the dishwasher at the end of the day, and they have held up great. They are not exactly waterproof, if you overfill the cup sometimes a little bit can leak out of the edge under the cap, however our son learned to drink from a cup with these and they never spilled on his shirt or in the car as long as we didn't overfill. Great little cups, love the opaque see-through feeling and you won't be guilty if you actually do toss them because the price cannot be beat! We just ordered some more of the First Years containers based on our super positive experience with these cups, love them!
This is the worst pad I have tried. They don't even have adhesive strips so are constantly slipping. Go with Lansiloh or better yet Johnson and Johnson if you can find them. I ended up throwing away the rest of the box!!!
These pads are great. The sticky tabs on the Heavy, Medium, and Light flow pads hold on really well. Even with more leaking that expected a lighter pad will hold up for quite a while. I have never had a problem no matter what strength pad I used. The super light pads don't have adhesive, and can soak through. I use them to double up on top of the leak proof stronger pads. That way if there is a little leak, I can toss the super light one and the main pad is still completely dry.The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is because I don't like that this is a variety pack. I would prefer to buy 100 medium flow pads and call it a day.
I bought these because my sister who had a baby a couple of months before me recommended them, but I was very dissapointed;  my clothes would always get soaked if I left them on for more than 3 hours.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because they worked well for my sister who does not leak as much as I do.
I bought the Gerber heavy flow pads and they worked great. I don't really have a problem with them moving around or anything, but best of all they don't leak!! These were the first ones I tried, but the next time I bought pads I saw the Avent ones were cheaper for more, it was the worst mistake, no matter how often I change the minute my breast start to leak my shirt is a wet nightmare. I will definitely be sticking with the Gerber nursing pads even if they are more expensive.
I started pumping about 2 weeks ago and find that this product works very well.  The backpack is cleverly designed to fit the motor and the collection kit in a compact manner.  It is also a nice discreet bag to travel with.  I found the pumping mechanism very comfortable even when my nipples were very sore from initial breastfeeding.  I've heard the hospital models are great but this works for me so I'm happy.
I got this breastpump after several of my friends told me that they spent money on other pumps only to throw them away and buy this one.  They advised me not to waste my money on the others because I would probably end up with this one anyway.  I am a stay at home mom and I was feeling guilty about the price until I read that formula feeding costs about $2000 a year.  I didn't feel bad about it anymore.My daughter is 5 months old and i have used it so much.  I pump every morning and store the milk in the freezer for nights out or for the occasional times when my milk won't let down.  And I want to keep her on breastmilk only for at least 6 months and this is the only way I can do it.  I can't keep up with her milk needs but I can use the milk that i pump every morning and I can give her the bottle later in the day when my milk supply gets low (as is usual for many women).I would highly recommend this breastpump!  It is fast and easy.  And I would recommend getting the sterilization bags from Medela to clean the parts.  It takes 3 minutes instead of 20 for boiling!!! TIP: I tried to sterilize the tubing and it melted it even though i put the recommended amount of water in the bag.  We called Medela and they sent me replacement tubing for free!  I was impressed with the customer service!
I bought this basket so that the lids from our little Take and Toss containers would not get flipped all over the dishwasher.  The lid is secure, and all of the lids get washed well.  We also put the tops of kid cups, bottle nipples, and bottle rings in it and everything gets clean.  It fits perfectly in the top rack of our dishwasher.  I'm happy with the product.
This is a very useful product. It&#8217;s hard to wash baby dishes without them disappearing in the dishwasher or falling to the bottom. This is great for bottle parts and pacifiers.  I would very much recommend this!If this review was helpful please select the &#8216;yes&#8217; button below.
I really like these pads. The only thing I don't care for is how thin they are. They are still really absorbent I just like the feel of a thicker pad. The lanolin is great though. I still use them for every other pad change just to get the lanolin. Would buy again.UPDATE: Ok the above was my original review with 4 stars. I felt the need to change it since these are by far the only pads I will use now. I've even tried putting lanolin on cheaper pads and its not the same. These don't bunch or roll. These are the BEST!!
I liked the convienece of these pads with the lanolin built in but the pads irritated my skin a little. The edges of the pads were not soft. I wouldn't purchase these again. I'm going back to the Johnson and Johnson pads.
I bought these, J & J, and Lansinoh shields to see which I liked best, and most days these are the ones I grab. Here's a comparison:THICKNESS & ABSORBENCY: J&J; are the thickest - great for under thin shirts or working out. They're also the cheapest so great when you're going to wear them for a few hours then toss them. BUT thickness does not equal absorbency - the gel in the First Years can take me from dinner to breakfast. The Lansinoh are in between, about as good as FY, but all are pretty good - in 4 months never exceeded their capacity. If you're looking for even further "enhancement," go with the J&J; - they add almost a cup when I wear them, though this is not my goal.DISCRETION: The First Years are the most discrete under moderately thick clothes, but tend to crinkle a bit at times and may show "folds" through thinner clothes. The J&J; & Lansinoh hold their shape a bit better.MOISTURE: If cracked nipples are your problem - these are your cure. No brainer - never have to remember the lanolin. I've never encountered one w/o the lanolin (as another reviewer complained) but I'm only on my 4th box.  HOWEVER, if you're dealing with Thrush(which I was for a while) then I'd suggest the Lansinoh - change every 3-4 hours - to minimize moisture against the breast and discourage yeast growth.COMFORT: I'd go w/the J&J; and Lansinoh (new & improved) as these FY have a crimped edge that can get really scratchy! THIS IS THE BIG PROBLEM. If it weren't for these scratchy crinkled edges, I'd never buy the others. But after a rough day of them rubbing I just need to grab the other brands. I prefer the Lansinoh for overnight as I find the new ones the softest and like the gel - it keeps me feeling dryer. I can often feel the wetness from the J&J.;CONCLUSION: These are great if you have less sensitive breasts and are prone to dry nipples, or want the convenience of pre-wrapped pads with a low profile. But buy one box first and see if the crinkled edges bother you before committing solely to these.
These nursing pads are amazing, they're the only ones I've found that are pre-coated with lanolin nipple cream, are very comfortable, don't slide around, and don't show under clothing.  What more can I say?  No complaints.
I have tried a few different kinds and these are my favorite disposable.  I mainly use the Bamboobies washable pads, but if I forget to do laundry these are great to have around.
I tried atleast 10 nipples/bottles before finding this one.  I was breastfeeding my newborn but she was going to need to take a bottle on occassion when I was not available.  After having her choke and sputter with many different nipple and crying and being frustrated for atleast 3 weeks, I found a dad whose wife had similar problems.  He recommended these nipples.  It worked like a charm.  She took it on the 2nd attempt.  It is very difficult for breastfeeding babies to use a bottle that is flowing too fast.  I dont know what we would have done without this nipple.  She did  quickly move up to the level 1's (around 3 mo) and to the level 2 around 5 mo, but this made taking a bottle possible for her.
My baby girl was full-term.  She is a slow eater and with the stage one nipple the milk was constantly spilling out of the sides and bottom of her mouth.  I couldn't find these preemie nipples in ANY of the local stores and I needed them right away.  I paid extra for next day delivery and so glad I did...worth it! Now she has no problems.  :)  (BTW, I first tried "Playtex Vent-Aire", as recommended by my lactation consultant, and it wasn't noticeably slower to me.)
If you talk to lactation consultants and speciailsts, they will all tell you to buy this nipple. The flow is slow, so your baby doesn't get addicted to the bottle! Our baby has been alternating between the bottle and breastfeeding for a month now, both are still going strong! They sell larger flow nipples, but as "The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding" says, it isn't as if your breast's flow increases during your child's life, why should the bottle? Let the baby eat slow!
I just needed another pack of these because just wanted to have extra ones.  Anything made by Dr. Brown is wonderful.
I have been extremely happy with the Dr Browns products, this one included. It's made to use with the Dr. Browns bottles and fits fine. They also work with other standard bottles. No leaking. I moved my baby to this size at 9 months. He breastfeeds and takes a bottle at daycare. No issues going back and forth. I purchased the level two nipples after he started collapsing the level 1 nipples in an attempt to get the milk out and we have since moved on to Level 3. He's adjusted to the faster flow just fine. I was concerned he would prefer the bottle to breastfeeding with the faster flow but that hasn't been the case. Another great product!
My baby has been using this since she turned 6 months. She is now almost 8 months. I haven't tried any other nipples so I don't have anything to compare this to but all of the Dr. Brown's nipples have worked great so far!
I love this cover, it fits great and looks great!  But they are way too expensive to buy enough of them to have throughout the week in between launderings.  So what I do is just keep the cover on all the time and put a similar colored bath towel on top of it, so I can just throw the towel in the laundry hamper when it gets dirty in between laundry days, then I just put a clean towel down.
It is a little too thin for my taste, but most covers seem to be.  It easily gets snagged on rings and jewelry so now I have to take my jewelry off before changing him.  It is pretty thin so it doesn't absorb or protect against any wetness.  I use a small pad to help protect it.  It is basically for design now and to match my son's bedding.
I have 3 of these (yellow, blue, and green). 3 was plenty, 1 being used, 1 being laundered, and 1 extra just in case. My son's is now 20 months old and they are still in great condition. He no longer uses a changing pad, but there is lots more use left in them for younger siblings. They did shrink up a little after being washed and are a little tight on the changing pad. Other than that they are great.
I am disappointed with the quality if this item. I have two and they both looked old, faded and worn after the first wash. Not happy.
Rear facing position will require 33 inches (or more depending on how your backseats are made) from the backseat to the front seat in order to get it level. If you have bench seats in front & less than that distance, forget it. It doesn't recline enough to act as an infant bed, but as of this writing you MAY put a rolled up towel under the front of the base in order to further level it out. Double check that before you do it, as things change. I have a minivan and the top of the carseat still pokes out between the two front bucket seats and they both had to be moved forward to accomodate, especially the passenger side.That being said, my baby has been riding in this seat since day 1. At less than 8 lbs, she was strapped in very securely. And even though my minivan doesn't have the LATCH system, the LATCH straps could be utilized in even my van to further secure it. Example being my 160 lb cousin who even flailed about in it and it wouldn't budge. It is NOT that hard to install as long as you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.If youre baby is small and even mine at 22 inches and less than 8 lbs was small for it, bring rolled up blankets to cushion the side in order to keep their back and head aligned. The infant insert doesn't quite go down far enough to really secure an infant's head from bobbing around a little. Of course, don't cushion the seat itself, by law, your baby's back has to be in contact with the seat cover itself and even at that small, they honestly don't need it.My child is now over 2 months old and 13 lbs and the extra cushioning isn't necessary. I use it for long journeys now just as an extra swaddle comfort to her. The 5 point belt, gives me peace of mind and it's a snap to get her in and out of it, a lot easier than some others I've seen and tried.So yes, it takes a lot of space, but then considering the cost for the length of use, who cares? It's rough, tough, the dark covers hide spot really nicely until you can wash it. I dunno how many parents I made jealous when they realized it had a cupholder too (that can be removed while your child is still too young to use such a thing). She's safe, its not budging even a little, that's all any parent can really ask of these things anyway right?My only beef is although the seat cover &quot;seems&quot; at first to be a breeze to take off to wash... it isn't.
We returned it for a Graco Ultra CarGo.The arm rests on Coscos are a joke.  I guarantee they will break off with little effort.
We are very satisfied with this car seat.  We have 3 car seats by this brand name.  All have worked well.  No complaints.
I bought this for my six month old son, since he grew out of his infant seat. One of the main reasons that I bought it was because of the review I read where the man said it saved his daughters life. Maybe as a foward facing seat this might be a good car seat, but I have not had a very good experenice using it rear facing. When I first took it out of the box I noticed how bad the fabric smells. It smells like some sort of chemical. I understand that some new fabrics smell, so rather than return it I let it air out for a few days. It still smells but not as bad. I had the hardest time threading the latch hook through one side of the car seat to the other. They tell you to lift up the padding to do it. Sounds easy, but it is so hard to get the padding off. Once I finally got it through, it was even harder to install in the car. It is very big. The latch belt doesn't tighten enough to where I feel it is safe. The harness buckles are very hard to put in and get out. It takes a million tries of pushing the red button as hard as I can to get the buckles to come undone. When my son is in the seat he kind of looks like he is just "floating". If he falls asleep, (even with the seat all the way reclined), his head ends up in his lap or on the side of the car seat. I rode in the back seat with him one day and it just doesn't look safe to me. I am not happy with this seat. I bought the graco comfort sport for half the price and it has worked out much better.
I've tried 2 others but this one is the one! It's comfortable, easy to use, very sturdy and safe. Definitely worth the money.
We bought this for our 6 month old son who outgrew his infant car seat due to being so long. We read through many reviews and consumer reports. We decided on this car seat. It was a reasonable price for us (not too expensive), yet it was still considered safe! Furthermore, he is rear facing still. I can see where it might be too big if you have a small car. We have a Chrysler Pacifica and it fits great! He can look out the window easier with this seat. He doesn't mind being in it at all. I love that there is so much space so he's not crammed in it. The only drawback is that when he falls asleep, there really isn't any place for him to put his head so his head hangs forward. I think we may need to insert some sort of pillow padding. Other than that, he weighs 17 pounds so we are hoping this will last him quite a while. So far, we have enjoyed this car seat!
Overall I think this is a good teether - my baby seems to like it. The different colors catch his eye and he likes the different textures. When I first bought this he was only 4 months old and it was difficult for him to twist it but now that he's almost 9 months he has no trouble.
Really cute toy for a baby. It twists around in very interesting ways. Well, interesting for an adult--my son couldn't twist it around as well as I could. I guess there are more exciting toys out there, but this is a good, affordable one to have in the toy box. I can't say it does much good as a teether though. My son never found a better teether than his own fingers.It also rattles very, very quietly. There are itty bitty plastic beads inside the clear sections.
This is THE ONLY toy my son was interested in before he was about 3 months old. He has loved it since he was about a month old and is still loving it at 7 months. From twisting and turning it to using it as a teether, it's always a hit.I would disagree with a previous post that it is hard to grip, it has always been easy for him to grip- that's one of the things we loved about it. However, I'm sure this varies baby to baby!Especially for the price, you can't go wrong.
My little man loves this toy.  It can be re-shaped several different ways, and it has rubber areas which are soft on his teething gums.  In addition, some moving things inside of the toy draw his attention.  Overall this is a very fair priced teether that is of sturdy quality and that my son seems to really enjoy playing with.
Other than being a little too wide to really get her mouth over to gnaw on, my baby loves this. She spends more time twisting and turning on it than teething on it, but it has been used!
My son would NOT use any of the teething toys we had for him UNTIL we found this toy!! It was AMAZING to finally have a bit of relief from the teething cries when he would sooth his gums and chew/suck on this :)
it is too big and too heavy for my 6-month-old baby to hold, and also the materials seem too hard for my baby to chew. My baby himself is not interested in it. a bad buy.
He's 6 mo now and he loves to play with it. I think the color and the rotation really got his attention.
Too thick for him to put in the mouth or hold in tiny fingers.. the soft rattle noise gets his attention for 20 seconds max..i like the thinner necklace type item better than this one.
I saw this toy and immediately loved it.  It's bright, well-made, and fun to play with.  But my children disagreed.  And, since it's a teether and toy, their opinions are the ones that matter.While babies, neither of my children used it for teething.  It might be because it's pretty big for a baby to handle, or maybe the textures just didn't work for them.  The now-toddler (29 months old) is not interested in playing with it, either.  It just takes up space in our toy area now, even though I bright it out every few weeks to reintroduce it and try to drum up interest.If you're looking for an all-around awesome teether, try theSuper Yummy Teether.  If you'd like a smaller, multi-purpose teether-type toy, tryLots of Links.  Both of these are easy to hold (even for little ones) and fun to chew.Bottom line:  Skip it.  There are better teether/toys for your baby and better twiddly desk toys for you.
my daughter will not let go of  this item ,it does its job it attract attention and before you know it hours pass  you by
Just enough sophisticated toy to keep my baby busy with it for long periods of time.Love it!
The toy twists different ways but it is much more rigid than i was expecting. Even the soft chewable surfaces are quite hard plastic and not at all flexable. Our baby has no teeth but I'm pretty sure that a full toothed kid couldn't do much damage to this. Lastly, our boy is completely uninterested in it and just drops it immediately every time we give it to him.
Needed something for my 10 month olds stocking at Christmas. He loves this toy and grabbed it right out of the stocking. It is a great buy, great price.
The shapes this nifty little toy gets into... it fascinates even me, let alone my little boy! The different grooves on the different segments helps him establish a good grip even while he chews on it.
My son didn't know what to do with it at first because he kept twisting it. Eventually, he realized that it had different textures. He was hooked!
my girl didnt like this toy at all, it was not good for teething! there's no soft material for her to bite on...she was not interested in it, and it was basically a waste of money.
my grandson loved this so much, I ordered this one for my granddaughter.  It twist easily so young ones can get it right where the new tooth is trying to come in.
I think I play with this more than the baby does. I love the way it moves into different shapes. I was hoping she'd use it as a teether, but so far not much I've purchased for her seems to appeal. She prefers fingers and spoons.
We have twin boys, and bought them two different teething rings recently -- this was one of them.They love them both - for different reasons.  We got them both this Munchkin ring and theNuby Bug A Loop Teether Bead, Colors May Vary.  They like the soft texture and flexibility of the Nuby ring.This ring is different - the links, or sections, are all stiff, though some have a soft coating on the outside.  As a teething toy, the different textures on the various sections are great to give the baby some variety.  Sometimes, they like chewing on the softer sections which have different molded textures.  Sometimes, they like to chew on the hard plastic sections.  It must be for them like choosing between Mounds and Almond Joy - sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.  Sometimes the baby wants to chew something hard, sometimes (s)he doesn't.Some of the hard plastic sections have little pieces inside to work like a rattle.  Don't worry - nothing's broken - that's the way it's designed.  As a parent, I appreciate that the rattle isn't too loud at all.I find that the babies like this just as much as a toy as they do for it's teething qualities.  They like to play with its various configurations, changing shapes, etc as they manipulate the sections.This has provided hours of entertainment and is almost always one of the items that we throw into their carseats or the diaper bag when we go out.Five stars for sure!
My son has had this since cutting his first tooth at 4 months old. At 11 months old, he's cutting his 9th tooth and this is still his favorite chew toy.  He doesn't care much for the hard plastic parts, but there's enough of the soft rubber/different texture parts for him to enjoy it.  It's easy to clean, cheap in price, and very durable.  I recommend it for your little teethers.
My baby uses it to bang on the counter and/or tray.  He makes him happy so I like that.  Enjoy
This is a really nifty toy to stick in the diaper bag or purse to keep the kiddo content while needing her to.... Well, be content... Works like a charm!!!
Easy to grab, twist and shake. My seven-month-old boy loves it more as days go by because he discoveres new features every time. Also, the price os great.
I like all Munchkin products that are not related with food. (The food ones are not microwave safer, so kind of disapointing)They work good and you get what you pay for.This theether is great as it twist, so the baby can adjust the toy according to what he needs to bite.
This toy is great.  Even I like playing with it.  It moves into different shapes and is well like by the baby.
My niece loves this toy. Different texture for her craving needs. The colors are beautiful and easy for her to hold. She loves it.
This definitely goes up there as one of the best teethers. I like that my son has lots of options for things to gum on. It's made really well!
This is too thick for baby mouth. It is hard for him to bite it and does not help with teething. At the same time it is at least fun cause it is bendable.
The rattle is not really a rattle to me but the different surfaces for my 8 month old teether is really good.
The greatest surprise we found when we got it was how twistable it was. I thought it was going to be just forming an 8 but it has so many different shapes then i find myself playing with it while my daughter plays with something else. It is very entertaining even for older kids.My 7 month old daughter likes it very much. it grew with her. We bought it when she was 4 month old and just liked to suck it, now she bangs it on the floor or the table. it is resistent, noisy enught and the rubber part is nice.
My son loves this both as a toy and as a teether. He loves chewing on the soft rubber ends when his gums are bothering him. It's easy for him to pick it up (he's 6 months old) and the different colors attract him to it. He also loves being able to bend it into different shapes.
We have several rattles and never used this one. The Bright Starts Rattle and Shake Barbell Rattle and Bright Starts Start Your Senses Play A Tune Piano Toy were the favorite and pretty much only used rattles in our house. Different children definitely enjoy different things but all the children that have been to our house have liked the same ones that my daughter did and we had a lot to chose from. This was a bad purchase for us.
Good for an older baby, not newborn. At four months my granddaughter is just beginning to experiment with this. It is thicker than most other teething toys, so she could not hold it earlier. But now she loves it! she can hole it and maneuver it so that she can try the different colored sections. Each one has a different texture. She loves looking at it and chewing on it, and even &#34;talks&#34; to it!
I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 1 month old daughter. Great, colorful, and good price. Would buy again.
Very colorful and not gender specific at all!!!Costs the same anywhere else but the shipping was quick and hassle free!!I hope my little one will like it when it comes to growing teeth.!!ALSO very gentile rattle noise
I got these for my 6-month old to play with and use as a teether because I saw it has such great ratings.  I like that it twists and turns in different ways, and some parts are rubber, so that she can grip it.  The other parts are smooth enough for her to suck on as well.  The only complaint is it's kind of big for a 6-month old hands to grip.  I wish they would have made it a tad bit smaller.  Price was decent on Amazon though.
Okay, I got this for newborn. It's CLEARLY stated it can NOT be used for sleeping, remember that. In fact, my baby distinctly disliked it. Now, if you have any good car-seats, etc. they come with quite good head-rests, etc. Thus, I really didn't have a need for this. Also, infants really don't "travel" much for this to be useful, as it's only supposed to be used in strollers, car-seats, bouncers, etc. This is CLEARLY stated in their product tag on the product. Now, as the child grows older and the need rises for these products, i.e. strollers, car-seats, etc., does this product is still needed? NO! Why? As I see it, it's during the 1st. 6 months, that there's an urgent need to have something in place, helping the child's head in developing to a correct shape. Thus: I am not sure of the product's usefulness.
Just get one of these (actually, I got two so I wouldn't have to keep moving it around so much.) At 2 months, our baby's head was getting awfully flat. Enough so that the pediatrician scheduled an appt at 3 months to look at it & possibly talk about "the helmet." I freaked & ran to our local BRU that same day. I used it in the swing, the activity rocker, the bouncer & in her stroller, but not her car seat. I also let her (danger danger!!) sleep on it at occassional naps. If I was sitting in my bed reading, I'd lay her next to me on her noggin nest for a nap. (Nothing dangerous there.) I wouldn't let her sleep on it at night, or anytime she wouldn't be constantly supervised. At any rate, by 3 months, the doctor said she had improved immensely, we'd just keep an eye on it. We kept using it & at 4 months, he said we didn't even need to worry about it anymore. I used it for a few more weeks after that, until she started turning her head a lot more at night & started sitting up. Now I only use it in her activity rocker as a pillow because she likes. She's 5 1/2 months now and has a beautiful round head! I can not recommend this highly enough!
We use this in the bouncer and in the swing and I feel it definitely helps!  My newborn daughter used to tend to turn her head to one side when she fell asleep in both the swing and the bouncer and now she seems to automatically keep her head face forward.  I can actually feel comfortable with her head to the side or face forward because she's supported by the cushion.  I think she actually rests better all together when using it.  It also fits in her car seat - we have a Laura Ashley Travel System - but since it comes with two headrest pads that pretty much cradle her head and being that she's not in the carseat that often, we just stick with those.  Otherwise, we also tried it in a Metrolite carseat and it fit fine.  If you have a brand new newborn and you are using a carseat - even one that has a built in head rest, you will want one of these anyway - or The Snuzzler - because baby's head and neck will be slumped all over the place...  While I haven't tried it in the crib, I would think that if you're putting baby to sleep on her back, it will still serve the same purpose and cushion baby's head just fine.  Now, I'm not sure if it will correct an existing problem but I'm pretty confident that it would prevent flat head syndrome if used early on.  Since it's only a couple bucks, it's worth putting it on your registry because someone will definitely buy it for you!
This actually came with my boppy and I actually had a few similar already made by other companies.  I went with this one.  The little extra donut can be removed once baby gets a little bigger, its soft, easy to use and I just liked it better than the ones I've used.  I wouln't use something like this in the crib though, but carseat or playtime is perfect.
We love this bedding.  Great quality and washes very nicely.  I also like that it is VERY easy to find coordinating Jersey knit crib sheets.  A yellow crib sheet with this set really looks nice & bright.  My husband and I could not be happier.
I registered for the barnyard items because they are cute, whimsical, and neutral, suitable for a boy or girl.I have received the crib set and it is wonderful.  Additionally, I have received the pillows, the mobile, and the fleece blanket.  All products are well-made, withstood washing, and are made of quality fabrics.  I also like the variety of colors which make it match almost any carpet/paint color one might have going on in their home.  The animals are cute and fun, and there is a variety of textures on the fabric such as quilting, waffle-weave, and fleece.  Feels nice to the touch.If you like the looks of this, I would highly recommend it-this set is serving us well with our daughter and if our next baby is a boy, then our nursery is all decorated already.
This pattern is adorable for a boy or girl!  The colors really catch a babies eye - our daughter loved to look at her bumper with all the animals and bright colors when she was a newborn.  We've since had to remove the bumper because she's 4 months but still loves her sheets, etc.  Words of advice...we registered for this at babiesrus but purchased many items from Burlington Coat Factory which was much cheaper.
I found that I needed a hamper for my 8 month old identical twin boys room. This goes great with thier in flight bedding and is very easy to use. It is nice looking and the mesh liner is strong and can hold about 5 days worth of twin clothes and blankets. I cant keep one in my 3 year old twins room because they drop everything in them and make a huge mess, so I just walk across the hall and put it in teh boys room. I dont know how the green part would wash, though I dont really see why you would have to do this frequently? It folds nicely too and is not too big. I love this hamper and would buy one again in a hearbeat!
I bought this hamper because it went well with the bedding set that we chose.  It comes in great colors to match just about anything.  I liked that it was plain too because we had enough stuff with patterns.  I also bought it because it was a great buy!  I have loved it!  The mesh liner that comes out is nice and sturdy and is very convienent.This is a great value!
This hamper is such a nice piece to have!  The outside it very nice looking, it is very easy to set up, and the inside mesh bag is very easy to use.  Whenever you have a full hamper, you simply pull the mesh bag out, take it over to the washing machine, dump the clothes in, and return the mesh liner to the hamper.  I am so glad we purchased this--worth every penny!  I have noticed that there have been several reviews that harp on this product because the outside cloth shrinks in the wash.  I have not yet tried to wash the cloth part of the hamper so I cannot tell you if it shrinks or not.  After having used it for three months, I have not had to wash it yet, and I'm not sure why you would even need to wash it all the time (as it appears many people are doing).  It works well for me!
I bought this hamper because of the price. The Bellissimo line has the same hamper for like double the price. This hamper is nice and very affordable I highly recommend it.
With all the baby accidents on the clothing that gets put into this hamper, it gets a bit "gamey".  So I washed it, in cold water and didn't put it in the dryer.  Well, it shrank so bad that it no longer reaches the bottom of the legs so you can velcro it.  I ended up tossing it.  You can't put a bedding change in it with anything else in there, it just doesn't have enough room and the frame is very cheaply made I was afraid it would break.  Not worth it.
I really do wonder how I lived with out this with my first child. This hamper is not only cute as its buttons but is so easy to use. Fill 'er up and walk off with the liner! I keep the liner on top of the dryer until the load is done, put everything back in the liner to carry back to the nursery. No extra step involving a bulky laundry basket. I would recommend this to anyone. Not that it matters, but mine is green:)
I thougt this was going to be a basic package to mix and match textures and colors.  But, you have to see it to believe it.  Awesome and such a bargain for the money.  I would have spent much more for this one.
I bought this for my 17 month old granddaughter.  ALthough I really like the concept, there are way too may pairs for her right now and some of the pairs have the same colored background.  For example the yellow sun matches up with a yellow colored piece that says &#34;yellow&#34; while a fluffy chick matches up to a yellow colored piece  that says &#34;fluffy.&#34; (It does have a square of the fluffy material on it too)  I took out 8 of the pairs to give to her and she is matching them almost all the time (pink and purple still confuse).  She doesn't quite put them together yet, but that will come.  I wish there were a few more textures, but when I think about it I guess I wouldn't want &#34;rough&#34; or &#34;scratchy.&#34;  Overall, I would recommend just don't overwhelm a one-year-old with all of the pairs at once.
When I clicked on the link to provide a review, I saw something completely different than what is in my son's room right now.  I can only review the pieces that are white with the image centered in the middle.  My son loves these pieces and they are very durable.  He has figured out how to match the sides and has turned into a game with my husband.  The colors are eye catching and the pictures are cute.  Again, I believe they may have changed this product.
Love the colors and textures in these puzzle pieces. Originally bought for my 1 year old to learn names and colors, etc., my dad said it would be great for my niece, almost 3 who loves to do puzzles. Now we both have a set.
My daughter loves these puzzle pieces. She's only a year old, but she is identifying which pieces go together within 2 weeks of playing with them. They have colors on them that match with the animals and the names of the colors. They are a great size as well. It's amazing to see how playtime with these puzzles can be so much fun and educational. I would approve this to any one getting a gift for a little one = ).
This product is pretty good quality.  It's made of heavy cardboard and the puzzle pieces fit together well.  My daughter, who turns 1 in a couple of weeks, has fun staring at the pictures and tossing the pieces around.  Her favorite is actually the box that the pieces are supposed to be stored in.  She carries the empty box all over the house.  She likes the yarn that makes up the box handle.  I'm sure we'll get more use out of the puzzle pieces once she's older.One thing I felt was misleading- there are not many "texture" pieces.  The title of this product is "matching colors and textures", but out of 20 pairs, only 4 have texture.  For the child, though, this will not matter-- it's just that I expected there to be more (at least 10 out of 20) textures.
My son is 20 months old and he loves the Infantino puzzles. We bought him 4 of diff types of puzzles since they were a very good price. He loves all.For this puzzle, he still doesnt put the colors together yet. Every kid is diffrent. My friend's child of the same age can name the colors and put them together. My son however does match the texture puzzles in this set. Its amazing to me how he was able to find the furry, bumpy, scales, leathery ones together. He can also piece together the rainbow colors and the butterfly colors because they are more vivid, bright and colorfull. The solid pink, orange, green, blue, black, yellow etc is really not his 'thing' yet. But all in all its great. Maybe those solid colors are not interesting yet for him :)I see comments on how the textures puzzles are fewer than expected and I think its not so true. I believe I saw a crocodile, a fish, a lizard, a rabbit, a mouse and couple more. Thats a lot and its good enough for the prize.The quality itself is pretty sturdy. Lot for my kid to learn and its a fun activity to get down on the floor and play with kids. We have other kids over and they sit down and all group together. Execellent for playdates too. Kids are encouraged to play as a TEAM to put together things.All in all excellent purchase.
Baby loves the bright colors, rattling, and ease of grasping. I love that it can be smashed into a diaper bag. A winning toy all around.
As another reviewer mentioned, this toy does not have a jingle bell, at least mine doesn't. But that makes no difference at all to me. I like it for hand therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. It is very good for that. Also durable. And the happy colors keep me at it!
My son LOVES this! he is four months old and really starting to discover his toys more and more and this is certainly one of his favorites. Easy to hold and the colors are great. I highly recommend.
My husband picked this one out and we both loved how it turned out. I washed everthing and it came out beautiful. The only caution is if you have a larger window and need 2 valances the set only comes with one. I ordered another online and the top border colors are not the same shade. I am not tha picky but you can tell the difference if you look at it. Not sure how to get around this one. Otherwise it is great.
I just love this whole color scheme.  We painted our son's room blue and got every piece to this set. It is just such a nice change from the baby blue with pastel colored bedding sets.  It is definitely a little boy's bedding set.  Some many things match it outside of this collection too because of the blue and red combination.  The sheets wash well too which is a nice plus.
What can i say about the Set. Cute, practical and washes up easily. When we found  out we were having a boy and a girl. Me and my husband both agreed to do the boys room in a sports theme. This was the one. We looked at some at JcPennys, Kohls, and Target. They all seemed to be great quality. But i wanted a set that came with everything to match. This even has a table, clock, and shelf with pegs on it. After i got home from the baby shower i washed everything and hung the comforter out to dry on the line. Sometimes after you wash something it looks dull and worn. This still looked like brand new. I have no problems with the sheet slipping off the matress. I recieved 2 more fitted sheets to use as spares and then 2 more plain blue sheets from JcPennys. I washed them once and the colored faded right away. The room looks great with everything in place. My baby boy loves laying in his crib still at almost 6 months and staring up at his mobile. The fleece blanket that comes in this set is my sons fav blanket. After he was a month old i seen how much loved the blanket so i went out and bought another one. I wash my babys fav blankets once a week and it still looks like new. After 6 months!!! This is a great bedding set.
I bought these for two very bath resistant boys. They took them out of the package and started playing with them before we even got into the tub! They look forward to the bath now so they can play with their "special" bath toys.I have a little problem getting the suction cups to stick to the tile walls. We pretty much just re-stick them every night as we're drawing the bath.The hoop is a little small for my kiddos to get the ball into, but that's helping them learn to aim better, so it's not a big deal.The balls are soft enough that it doesn't hurt if (when) they throw them at each other. They bounce pretty easily off the walls too so be prepared to chase them around the bathroom!This was one of three bath toy sets I recently bought to replace old toys and this is the one they want to play with the most.
Our 5 yr old loves this and uses it every time he is in the tub.  And I have to admit, I think my husband REALLY likes it too.it sticks well to the tile wall and makes bath time fun!
We surprised our 2yr old daughter with this basketball set for the tub. She absolutely loves it & does not want bath time to end!
This is a good toy.  My son loves to pick up the basketballs and dunk them.  He also likes to fill them up with water and squirt them.  I know the age says 3 years or older, but my son is 14months old and he has had this toy for a month and loved it from day 1.
The netting on the hoop loosened and is coming off on one side and the balls are just ok.  I thought that maybe since it is a bath toy that there would be no holes in them to let water inside.  Every time my son would squeeze a ball black gunk would come out.  I threw away the entire set, waste of money. Would have given a better rating if it weren't for the balls that allow water to sit stagnate and get moldy.
My daughter is going thru a stage at 2 1/2 where she doesnt want to take a bath. I bought this as a distraction. It worked! The 3 balls are very cute and soft. The hoop is sturdy and the suction cups are great.
I just have to put it in the tub...for some reason my boys just wanted to play with the balls outside of the tub.
my daughter was 12 months when I bought this for her and she is now 15 months. and by far it is her favorite toy. the balls fill up with water and she loves squeezing them like a squirt gun. and somehow she never tires of putting them into the basket and then taking them out!
doesn't stay stuck on the tub but cute and hasn't broken yet (after 2 years) would recommend for little kids
I got this for my nephew and son and they absolutely love this. I highly recommend this for small toddlers.
My 18-24 month old got fairly annoyed with this bath toy.  The hoop is just a net, so the balls don't come out of the bottom.  You have to reach back into the hoop to get the balls out.  When my son or I did this, the hoop came off the bathtub wall.  I specifically had a problem with the left suction cup not staying attached.  The right suction cup worked fine, so the hoop was always falling sideways.  Also, the balls have small holes in them and take in water.  I had a serious issue with mold collecting in the balls...and at bathtime, if you squeezed the balls, a ton of mold flakes come out.  Unless I cleaned them out before bath time, I really didn't want them in the tub.  I'd suggest going with another brand.
This is our second time purchasing this toy.  The kids love playing with it in the tub and it sticks to the wall very well.  The only thing to watch out for is that water can get into the balls, so you need to make sure it's out or the water at the end of bath time.  A small price to pay for the entertainment. :)
We've had several different uses out of this hoops and ball set.  The three balls are a perfect size for our son, who has had these since he turned 2.  He has other toys such as floating rings that he uses the balls with and while younger he just used the net to store the balls.  Later, he figured out that the balls could squirt, and even later he would bite the ball with the hole facing outwards to squirt it and laugh and laugh.  He's only now starting to use to to actually shoot hoops.I'm going to cut the bottom off the net soon so that he can put the hoop higher on the bathroom wall and shoot hoops.  The suction cups have worked very well for us and still do, and no mold or anything thus far.  The suction cups didn't work well in our other bathroom because the tiles have texture.
Though this monitor is very sensitive and can pick up other sounds from outside, you can hear the smallest peep from your baby which I think for myself as a new parent, in the beginning particularly, reassuring. The product is very lightweight which some folks may find frustrating as it can topple over easily, however I have had no need to move the receivers around unless I want to wear them on a belt as I'm doing things around the house and being lightweight is a good thing in that case. I am highly recommending this monitor as it is not only inexpensive, but at least for us...it remains static free. I've never had any problem with it.
Overall, I am quite pleased with this monitor especially given the price compared to other higher priced monitors.  The range is very good - we can take it to our back yard and know we can hear her.  Once in a while, we will get interference (static) and not sure if it's from our cell phones or what but it gets loud and I can't get it to stop.I also wish there were numbers on the volume so I could put it on the same volume every time.  Sometimes I have it too low and can't hear her and others it's too loud and you get blasted.
We tried this one out since all the reviews I read were so good but unfortunately, we were not pleased with it.  When you plug it into the wall it seems to have a lot of static and it doesn't seem to matter where in the house you try it.  Don't waste your money...
I use this monitor in addition to the Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor by Summer.  This monitor picks up the slightest baby sounds so that you as sure to hear them if they need you, but you can also keep the volume low so that you are not disturbed by every movement while you are sleeping.  I love the two handsets to use throughout the house or outside.  I now take it with me when visiting friends so that I am sure to hear him in a large apartment.  I haven't used the glow light to change the baby, but the light times out by itself if you do choose to use it.We also couldn't live without the video monitor.  It has been an essential tool in looking after our son.  He's 3.5 months now and sleeps on his tummy.  This is the only position he sleeps in and as a consequence, it was necessary to watch him very closely when he was younger and couldn't roll over.  I keep it on my desk and watch him sleeping.  Getting to know your baby's personality and behavior by observing him while sleeping is very helpful in anticipating his needs.  This is well worth the money.  I also use the safety first monitor with two handsets to carry outside to the back yard.  It's an inexpensive monitor and very efficient at picking up the slightest sound your little one makes.
I love this monitor - it conducts every sound from the nursery during all uses but my favorite use for it is when I'm in the shower.  The red lights show me if my baby is starting to fuss even when I can't hear him because of the water.  It's given me the peace of mind to be able to wander freely around the house, do things that are noisy, etc. without worrying that I won't "hear" my baby because I'll be able to see if he needs me.  The base light has also been very helpful for middle of the night diaper changes.  It's soft glow gives us enough light to make sure we've done a good clean up but isn't bright enough to make the baby think it's time to really wake up and play.
this monitor does not make any distortion noises or anything of that sort.  It is so clear I can hear my husband talking from a few rooms away.  Can say enough good things about this.
I love this monitor.  I love that it has two receivers.  We keep one in our bedroom and one in the living room.  We keep them plugged in, but the one in the living room we also keep a battery in, so we can just unplug it and clip it to our pockets when we go outside or something.  We have never had a problem with static, despite living in a typical suburban neighborhood and have cordless phones, cell phones, and live next to an electrical tower.  It picks up every little sound beautifully -- even when at the back of our half-acre property!  I especially love that the transmitter is a light when you press it!  I think it helps my daughter go to sleep so she's not jolted into pitch black when we put her down.  The light turns off by itself after about 15 minutes.  I highly recommend this product!
This was the third monitor that I tried, and I think this one is great.  The only concerns that I have are that the lights don't really correspond with the noise.  If a car goes by, the noise isn't really that loud, but the lights go all the way up.  If the base is too close to the receivers, you'll get noises, but that's the only problem I've had.  Sometimes switching channels on it will cause me to hear my neighbor's telephone conversation, but I switched it back and it was fine.I love that it has 2 receivers.  I have one in my bedroom, and another in my den on the other side of the house, so I can always hear the baby, and I don't have to move them around.  I also like the fact that I can hear my son breathing...that's how sensitive the monitor is.  I love it.
This monitor is extremely sensitive.  I can easily hear sounds as soft as my son breathing. I'm very happy with the product and highly recommend it.
I registered for this monitor based on the Amazon reviews, the reasonable price and the fact that it came with 2 receivers.  I have been using it for the past 2 months and am very pleased with the quality.  Having 2 receivers is wonderful for a 2-story house and I rarely have to move them...  I just keep them plugged in where they are so I never need batteries.  This monitor is extremely sensitive so we do have to keep the volume very low, but I've found that if I put the monitor on my daughter's dresser (about 5 feet from her crib) and point it directly at her crib that the reception isn't so amazingly loud.  I would highly recommend this monitor!UPDATE NOVEMBER 2007:  We still have this monitor and use it every day.  We have been using it for the past 3 years without a glitch!  Still highly recommended!
This product is horrible.  When we first plugged it in it worked ok.  Within hours we were getting horrible static.  We tried all different places in our house to plug it in and it didn't get any better.  We finally found two places where the static isn't THAT bad and we now leave the monitors there, plugged in and turned on ALL the time!  One night, when the baby was fussing and my husband was trying to get some sleep, I turned of the monitor in the babies room and we found out that the recievers will then pick up a country radio station!  Maybe that's the cause of the static.  Horrible product.  Do not waste your money unless you like to be disappointed or if you like to return products to the stores!
This monitor works so well... you can hear every sound the baby makes!  I was getting some feedback for a few days until i realized I had my cordless phone too close to the reciever (the cordless phone also distorts my tv if it is too close!).  I highly recommend this monitor!!!!!
I have been using my monitor for the past 7 weeks and have not had any problems with it. It has clear reception and I like how I get 2 receiver monitors because we have an upstairs and downstairs. I think this is a good product that is reasonable priced.
We love this monitor.  I've had no trouble hearing it all over the house and in the front and back yards.  We have the one receiver plugged in our bedroom and the other receiver is on batteries so I can carry it with me throughout the house.The monitor, in my daughter's room, has a night light that stays on for 15 minutes, which is just enough time to change her diaper and get settled down to feed her.  It has two different channels and the receivers have belt clips.I've had no problems with static and we have appliances running all of the time (and cell phones and cordless phones).Love this monitor!
We love this monitor, it works great and we've had no problems with static or interference.  The nightlight is a great feature as well.When we were registering for our baby shower at Babies R Us, the sales associate said that this monitor gets the best reviews from parents, and hardly any are returned.
I like this product but it is not as good as I thought it would be.I had visions of it being level with the bed, an extension of the bed that I could slide the baby across. Instead there is a lip to get the baby over. I am using this as I would use a bassinett; it is right next to my bed (not attached with the straps) but on an angle so I can get in/out of my bed. By the time you have your bedside table and the co-sleeper alongside your bed there is not much room! I can reach over and pat him or fish around to replace a dropped pacifier but to get him into my bed I need to sit up and lift him out.- The sleeping surface is not level as the base that the mattress sits on is only cloth so it sinks a bit in the middle, however, I bought it second hand so that may be the reason.- I agree with other reviewers that the mattress is hard but I haven't done anything about that because my baby has not been bothered by it but I plan to pad it with a blanket as I have noticed he falls asleep on my bed or his soft changing pad pretty quickly in comparison.- It folds up nice and small so I can store it easily until the next baby comes along.- It is quite a good size for having beside a bed and it has pockets on the side so if I wanted to move my bedside table out of the way I could put a bottle of water, tissues and other bedside table stuff in the pockets.- This is only a co-sleeper, I think the larger version converts into a playpen. I probably should have gotten the larger one for it's versatility later.
Bought with first baby and attached it to bed. It could've been a little lower so I could look in without having to sit up in bed.  But we loved it, it was nice to have the baby close but not in the bed.  It has some pockets for extras like diapers but I didn't really use them.Now I have baby #2, and we used it again. Still love it, used the pockets this time. Wish they were deeper!  It's nice to be able to store extra bedding beneath the sleeper part too.  Good buy!
We had already debated the co-sleeper versus play yard decision & chose a play yard, reasoning that we would use it longer & that it wouldn't be that big a deal to hop out of bed a few steps to grab the baby. Then I had a c-section & my husband ran out to get the co-sleeper after all. We got the mini because I just didn't want to have to crawl all the way to the foot of my bed to get up like I would have to with the full size.I was just sure this would make night time breastfeeding much easier. (You know: grab the baby, latch her on & lay back & get a few more winks while she nurses.) If you haven't yet had your baby & you share this fantasy: get over it. You won't be laying down to nurse with a brand new baby. And if your baby is like mine (90% on the growth charts) she likely may have out-grown the mini by the time she can nurse successfully laying down.But I still give this 5 stars because it made life so much easier. We chose to have our baby sleep in our room until 3 months. All those crazy sounds that you're not used to coming over a baby monitor from another room, mean you really won't get any sleep because you'll be trudging up & down the hall all night long, and not just for feedings. Likewise, a crib or play yard (even in the same room) has the problem that you'll be getting up dozens of times a night to check on her. But with the co-sleeper, I just had to turn my head & see that she was fine. It's a lot easier to get back to sleep if you haven't had to get out of bed.We weren't prepared to commit long-term to co-sleeping or "the family bed." I always knew we would move her to her own room at some point. (It turned out to be 3 months, instead of the 2 I'd originally planned.) As a new, first time parent, I know I got a lot more sleep than I would have with any other set up. (And sleep is soooo precious in those first weeks!) By the time we were ready to move her to her own room, the mini was getting pretty tight, but it was just the right size for our needs & for the period of time we needed it. We didn't need the ability to use it as a play yard later, like the full size can, because we already own a Graco play yard. But, honestly, we've never even used it.If you are planning to have your baby sleep in your room for 2 to 6 months, the mini co-sleeper will be perfect.
We love (!) the co-sleeper. Our 3 month old is getting a bit too big for it and I hate to move her into a crib; wish these ran in larger sizes. The co-sleeper links to our bed and I can easily see her at night, lift her up without getting out of bed, feed her and return her, all while sitting in my bed. If she cries I can easily reach and touch her without effort. I highly recommend the co-sleeper to any new parent, mainly for the piece of mind!
I recieved this before my daughter was born last Feb. It's still set up in my room, and she's almost 11 months old. I use it next to my bed as a buffer just in case now when I bring her into bed with me sometimes. When she was a newborn, she slept in this cosleeper daily. She slept in it until she was about 6-7 months old I believe. I only gave it 4 stars though because it wasn't that great to try to transfer a sleeping babe back into this cosleeper from your bed...I always had to get up to do this without waking my daughter. Otherwise, I really liked this cosleeper and still use it just about every night...although now I use it to prop pillows so my daughter cannot roll/crawl off the bed.
I received this and set it up before the baby was born.  I had a c-section and exclusively breast-fed the baby.Pros:1) I loved having her sleeping right next to me in a safe area.2) Breastfeeding was so much easier, I would just pick her up and feed her (normally wouldn't just put her back though, because babies need their diapers changed A LOT at that age!)3) The mesh sides were great; for some reason baby loves sleeping with her face against something, so having the mesh there made me feel so much more comfortable that she was safe.4) Easy set up, and used the storage (still using it, even though she is sleeping in her own room!)Cons:1) I didn't move my nightstand because I wanted easy access to the lamp and the notebook where I was keeping track of her feedings, so her head was lower than mine (I'd just scootch down and sleep face to face with her).2) Since the co-sleeper was lower, it was harder for me to get in and out of bed, especially with the recent c-section.3) Only really lasted for 4 months, because she moved to her own room at that age.  I think any more than that and she would have been too large for it anyway.Overall I'd recommend buying this if you don't want to co-sleep, but still want baby sleeping in your room with you.
We purchased the Mini Co-Sleeper instead of a bassinet or a cradle because we liked the idea of having our baby right up against the bed.The sleeper is very sturdy.  It has 2 wheels and 2 stationary legs, so it can be mobile when needed, but stationary when baby is in it.  It also has a strap that fits underneath your mattress and attaches on the other side, which would secure the sleeper to the bed.  We didn't actually use this feature because I wanted to be able to move the sleeper to get in and out of bed without crawling over my husband.One side can fold down or up depending on whether you want to use the sleeper as a free standing unit or attached to the bed.  There is also a storage compartment that is great for storing extra sheets.My favorite thing about the Mini co-sleeper is the peace of mind it gave me.  As a first time mom, I was a little nervous at first. Always wanted to check on the baby to make sure he was ok, hadn't rolled over, etc.  This way I could check on him without waking him or my husband.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the cost of extra sheets. Mini Co-Sleeper makes their own extra sheets (one comes with the sleeper but you'll need to buy extras).  The special sheets have velcro on the bottom that stick to the bottom of the sleeper to keep it secure in place.  The sheets are nice, but they're like $12 - 14 each which is ridiculous.  And they're hard to find (not carried through Amazon).  The salesman at the store told me that regular cradle sheets will fit fine.  We use the Koala Baby sheets and they are a little big but they do work ok.  We put a waterproof mattress pad down and the sheet on top and that seems to give the mattress a little extra cushion.  Again, not perfect, but it's still ok.Overall, I really feel like we made a good choice in getting a co-sleeper over a bassinet or cradle.  My son is now 4 months old and has moved into a crib, but we will definitely be saving this for our next child.
I borrowed this from a friend because our son hated our very expensive bassinet. The first night that he slept in this went great. He went to sleep and didn't fuss. He stayed in the same spot so I know that he was comfortable.The only thing I didn't like was I couldn't use it as a side sleeper because out mattress is to high. So if that is what you want it for you should measure first.I will buy this for my next child and the bassinet can stay in the crawl space!!!
This product arrives ready to use. It took me five minutes to unpack it and click the already-assembled bars into place. I am writing this review with my daughter sleeping safely next to me. I feel so much better knowing that I can keep her with me around the house and still get things done because I can wheel her around the house. I used a Moby wrap with my son, but he's 4 now, and I need to be mobile with two children. So, now if he needs me to play with him or get him something, I can keep my daughter in the room with us, and keep an eye on her, and not worry. Since she does't cry when she needs something, I don't trust the baby monitors, I would rather have her where I can see her. This is the perfect product for just that, small, portable, and lightweight.
I love this product and feel lucky to have stumbled upon it.  Like most people, I imagined that I'd have my baby in a crib, in his own room, from birth.  My baby decided otherwise - even at the hospital, he was not content to sleep apart from us.  The co-sleeper has not only made it easier to care for him in the first demanding weeks and months of life, but it has made us both happier and better sleepers.The co-sleeper attaches securely to the side of the bed.  However, it doesn't not have a flat connection - your baby is not going to roll into the adult bed.  There is a bit of a ridge.  With our high bed, it's also a bit lower even with three sets of leg extensions added.  My only criticism is that the mattress feels a bit hard - as hard as a pack & play. It isn't as soft as a crib mattress. I know the professionals recommend hard mattresses, but I can't imagine myself sleeping on something this hard.  Still, the baby seems to have gotten used to it and doesn't complain.Leg extensions are recommended in case you ever want to put the co-sleeper in an incline position, for GERD or nasal congestion reasons. Multiple sheets are also recommended for obvious reasons.  We went through three in one of our first nights before we figured out that we had leaky diapers.I really like that I can easily pick him up and bring him into bed.  I also like to be able to reach over, while still lying down, and pat him to comfort him.  I've even fallen asleep holding his little hand.  And yet I've never worried about rolling over him, or having him fall out of bed - things that one may worry about if the baby was actually in the bed. [And no judgement on that!  Sometimes I've had the baby in bed with us for nursing or to console him, and slept ... the co-sleeper attachment just gives some extra feelings of security.]  Our baby seems very comforted seeing one of his parents near him, just inches away.  We cannot put him down in the crib awake, but he will look at us lying down on the big bed next to his co-sleeper and feel safe enough to fall back asleep.  Also, if he wakes in the crib, he cries - if he wakes in the co-sleeper, he tends to "play" or at least chill out.For myself, I do sleep better with him so close by.  I know I will hear him if he needs me.  I can sleep through the little night noises he makes, knowing I will hear any serious cries.  We do not need a monitor, and with all the static on monitors, I don't need that keeping me awake.  Also, with the monitor (we do have one), I would wake up for every sound and want to go into the nursery to check.  With the co-sleeper, I can just look over - and most of the time - I will sleep through the minor grunts and sighs that babies make in the middle of the night.
Good because:-It doesn't take up a lot of space.-It's the perfect size for a tiny one.-Great practical use. Once your baby doesn't fit in it, you can use it to store baby's stuffed animals or other things.I gave it only 4 stars because:-Weight limit is 15 lbs. and my daughter only fit in it up to 4 months.
My baby has had some fun with this toy (3-5months) but it definately ranks far down the list of toys he enjoys and I'm sure there are hundreds of others I could have purchased instead of this one and gotten more playtime out of them.  The suction cup works but only if you have a place to suction it that your baby can't reach but can see and it doesn't frustrate him to not be able to touch his toys.  All the pieces come apart from each other which is nice but also a problem if you're trying to keep it together.  Most babies are stronger than velcro and magnetic clasps.  It's also just not as interesting to look at or chew as many other toys we've tried.
The sun itself is on the rare window of the car all the time. Toys I use in a crib or infant seat.I love snail and my sons favorite is a snail too. it makes great calm noise.Even our dog likes to steal toys from infant seat if he manages to =) and happily run around with it.It is cheap really, but very very cute and materials are very nice.I recommend it!
I bought this for my car - so far I haven't had any problems with suction, etc.  My daughter seems to like it.
I bought this for our son and it is great on his car seat! Worth the money!
This is a great purchase choice.  It costs much less and is safer than a wooden toybox of the same size.  It's also more Fun!  It has an attached, fold-down/open play mat on the front which my son loves.  It has extra storage "nets" on the sides, and a removable carrying case that fits in the smaller section inside.  It's also very sturdy for being soft-sided.
I picked this storage box up after exhausting myself trying to find an easy to maneuver and safe toy box for my toddler's toys without spending a fortune (canvas bins, baskets with liners, etc.).  It is not an heirloom wooden toy box, but really serves the purpose and looks better in our living room than a rubbermaid bin or a series of open top baskets.  It is roomy, has a soft lid that you can either use closed or tuck behind.  The sides have mesh pockets for books and the tote bag fits into one side (after putting in divider).  The sides and divider that velcros inside to divide into 2 sections would probably bend if the baby smashed into them, stood on them, etc., but the plus side for me is that she cannot turn it into a stepladder because it is somewhat pliable.  For the price, it cannot be beat and provides good temporary toy storage.
I bought this box a bit under 2 years ago... ended up buying a second one because I liked it so much! I didn't have any smell issue. I agree with the other posters that if you want a box that will hold its shape and is easy to close, you should probably not get it, as big toys can definitely alter its shape and make it hard to close the lid. But if you want a nice box to just hold toys without worrying about your child getting fingers pinched or falling on a corner, it's a must-buy - plus we never really cared about a toy box we could close anyway, and it sure beats large plastic bins.
I wanted a soft, spacious toybox and this one is GREAT.  Despite being "soft" it is sturdy and I move it around the room with ease (using both handles).  Others have complained about the smell.  It does have a "new" smell but was never overwhelming and left soon enough after setting it up.  The take-out toy bag is great for on-the-go.  The toybox has a divider and I put large toys on one side and smaller toys on the other side in the bag.  It doesn't get a five star simply because of the color scheme - a little boring and not what I expected.  It's lighter blue than the picture.  Still, it is a great product.
My daughter loves this toy box.  She has fun playing with the fold down front.  She is at an age where she really likes taking her toys out and putting them back in, so she does that a lot.  The box is sturdy enough to withstand her using it to lean on and pull herself up with, and I can pick up the whole box without it collapsing in on itself.  I would buy this again.
I was really excited to use this item since my son was born in December but it was so diffuclt to figure out how it fits on to the car seat I just gave up and returned it.
I'm glad I didn't have to put layers of clothes on my newborn. This is very convenient. You also don't need to worry that the baby overheating in the winter clothes in the car. Just use your regular clothes with this Bundle me. Way too expensive in my opinion, but I couldn't find any nice alternative. Very happy with the product.
We have used the JJ Cole Infant Bundle Me with two kids now and think that it is a great product.  It keeps my little ones bundled in for the coldest of days.  When really cold I just tuck a small blanket around my little one and then zip him up into the Bundle Me. The inside is very soft and thick and warm.  It fits our Graco carseat well and we have no trouble putting it in the base or putting the baby in the harness because of the Bundle Me.
Its a must have for winter time! Its soft, worm & easy to clean, i have 2, for my toddler & newborn!
The fleece (polyester) that lines the inside comes off so easily. My little one had it all over her hands. I didn't want her to swallow it or inhale it so I sent it back. I use the Bundle Me Lite and that works great...no fuzzies that come off.
I love this!  It's great because you don't have to pack a bunch of blankets to keep your baby warm.  You just put your baby in and zip them up and your done.  If it's really windy or snowing when I'm carrying my daughter to and from the car I just flip up the cover over her to protect her from the elements until I get inside and then I just flip it off of her.  Super easy!
I returned the product.  It is way too bulky to add to a car seat.  I brought the car seat with the Bundle Me installed to my local fire department for inspection of proper installation.  My husband got an "A" for proper car seat installation.  I got an "F" for having this product in the car seat.  It has too much cushion, causing too much give in the event of an accident. The inspector told us to get rid of it.  Perhaps this product is good for a stroller?
This item is so nice. It is very warm. My daughter was born January 30th in Wisconsin so it is very cold - 0 degrees. When we would take her out in February we only had a onsie, an outfit, socks and a hat. No need for a snowsuit or anything super warm. When it was a little colder, around zero, we would put a little jacket or sweater on her but that's all. It is also very comfortable for her. Great product!!!
I bought the Bundle Me after I discovered that the Land's End's Polartec Car Seat Cover I planned to buy was backordered.  Bummer!  I really needed a way to keep him warm right away.  After doing some research, I decided to buy the Bundle Me.  I have no regrets.  I had no problems washing it.  It is easy to put into the car seat.  He's always warm and toasty.  If it's cold, I keep him zipped up and once inside, he is unzipped so he doesn't get overheated.  I'm sure there are other products that do the same job, but bottom line, for those of you looking to buy this one, is that it works.
It gets very cold here in the winter and my son was born in Jan.  This is the coziest product, and helps us parents do a little less bundling of the baby.  We have enough to do JUST to leave the house.  No poofy coats, just a nice warm cacoon for you little one.  I never had any problem with it and when it starts to warm up you can just remove the top portion and your good to go.  I love this!
I actually got one of these handed down after much use and it is still in wonderful shape.  It is nice and soft and easy to throw in the washing machine.  I have a 2 week old and it saves so much time so we don't have to bundle her up everytime we leave the house (she was born in late January in the mountains of NC.)  It is easy to put on and I put an infant body support pillow on top of it in the carseat to support her head.  Perfect!
This is by far one of my favorite items I own as a new mom. I live is a cold climate , and it is an item I suggest any new parent to get. It is a so much more convienent than trying to put the baby in a bunting outfit, or trying to stuff blankets over the baby when they are in a carseat or stroller
Fits perfectly in newborn car seat. Don't have to worry about 2 day old grand son catching a chill outside or till the car warms up
I had an August baby but when those cold months came around we needed something for our picky & very light sleeper! This solved EVERYTHING! We could put this into his car seat and take him anywhere. He slept warm and snug and we never had to disturb him no matter where we wanted to go. The fleece under his head acted like a sound barrier so restraunts weren't a problem any longer. I also loved that there was two different zippers (one on each side) so I have full control of ventalation. I did have the fleece come off of it in the beginning, but after being washed 2-3 times it was fine. I washed it over 20 times and it still looked new!
I bought this wrap based on the praise it received.  But I think it is way too expensive for what it is.  It is also time consuming and cumbersome to put on.  You do get the hang of it but it still takes time to get it just right and drags the floor in the process.  Also my 18 month old didn't seem that safe in it.  I felt like he was about to fall out all the time.  And I wondered if the bunched material under his butt and back hurt him.  It pulls up on your shirt so make sure you wear a long one!  And it left black looking fuzz all over my hands and clothes every time I touched it.  I washed it several times and even lint rolled it and it still didn't help. It's also made of a thick t-shirt like material and made me and my son hot.  The only thing about it I liked was that it didn't hurt my back or neck like other baby carriers.I am still on the search for the perfect baby carrier...
Ok, once its on and done, I love it. My baby feels secure, its the ultimate in custom adjustibility and size is not a factor. It has a lot of variances in ways to carry and the pocket on the outside is extremely handy.However, when you live in the south and have this on over anything, it's very HOT. It takes a while to get it on, wrapped, and cinched where its comfortable, so slinging it on and off is not only not an option, you tend to dread the idea.Another point I will add is I used this right after having my baby, so I still had that 6 month pregnant-looking belly. With this sling, you get this lovely effect where the belt part goes below the belly and the crossover cinches itself to your chest after any length of wear. For those largely pregnant, just find yourself the tiniest halter top, crop top, or babydoll tee you can and put it on (if you can), then take a long sash and cinch it up under your belly... that's what you're going to look like in this thing. sexy, huh?
My husband and I are smart people, but even after reading the instructions and following them closely, I don't think we ever got this to work correctly.  We tried it when our daughter was 1-2 months old and no matter which way we had her in the carrier, she hated it.  We never tried another carrier, so I don't have a point of comparison, but we hated this one so much, that we brought it back to the store.
what a pain to use! who wants or can spend all the time needed to properly attach this item  to yourself and still take care of your sweetie? cannot seem to get it to wrap tight enough to make me feel secure to tote bubbies around. i would not buy this item if i where you.
To be fair we didn't have this for long. We tried the carrier on 16 month old (at that time) and it took to look to put on and immediately began to sag. I wanted mainly for a sling, so that in public I could nurse without attracting to much attention, but it was too long and too much of a hassle to put it on so we returned it. I have yet to fine one that will fit and still be a reasonable price.
This is a great carrier, once you figure it out. My husband and I had to take a few minutes to get it down, but after the first two or three times using it I didn't have to use the directions anymore. For a newborn, it is awesome - other carriers can feel awkward, but this carrier adjusts to the size.The drawbacks - this is made of a t-shirt-like material, so as you wear it the material stretches and the baby tends to slide down. Also, it is sufficiently complicated that you can't put it on while you hold the baby. I found that life was made easier if I put it on before I left my house, and then when I got out of the car where I was going I could put the baby in. It is comfortable enough to wear without the baby in too, so you can put it on once for the day even if you put the baby in and out.
I got this carrier as a shower gift and had NO IDEA how much use I would get out of it.  My daughter is about three months old and, since she was about six weeks, has wanted to be held ALL the time.  I'd never get anything done if I didn't have the Snugli!  But as long as I carry her around in the Snugli, she is completely happy, and I can keep my hands free to get things done.  People always comment on what a well-behaved baby she is, and I attribute that in large part to the Snugli, because whenever she starts to get fussy, I can just strap her in, and carry her around, and she feels totally reassured.Some people have complained about the straps, but I have never had any problem with them.  You have to read the directions the first time, but if you do, they're very easy.  My husband and I (who are TOTALLY different sizes) switch it back and forth all the time, and it literally only takes about 20 seconds to readjust each time.  And with the amount of time I spend wearing this thing (often several hours each day), I really appreciate the back support it provides.  The standard Baby Bjorn doesn't have a waist strap, and I don't know how I would get along without it.Some people have also complained about the material of the carrier being too hot or rough, but my daughter seems totally comfortable in it, and even frequently falls asleep.
We registered for this carrier for our second child. It is so much more comfortable than the snugli I used with my daughter 4 years ago (but that was 4 years ago, I'm sure they make them different now. My son loves to use it when we go shopping, for a walk and it makes house work easier when he wants to be held all day (my husband laughs when he sees me vaccuming with our son attached to be via the carrier). But I only gave it four stars not five because all of the buckles and straps can be confusing, espeacially if you out running arrands (with no instruction booklet handy)and your child no longer wants to face you and wants to look at the world around him. He just had to stare at mommy the rest of the outing. But with the instructions and a little time to spare you can learn the 'in and outs' of this carrier and love it as much as we have.
I have tried to use this carrier a dozen times, but to no avail.  My good-natured son cries and cries in what seems to be discomfort.  Though he's only 11 lbs, my shoulders ache after having him in it for only minutes--I guess the straps are not padded enough.  I thought I would be saving money by purchasing a Snugli instead of a Baby Bjorn!  I gave it two stars because it was easy to set up and it positions nicely--just didn't work out for us.  I recommend trying it out at the store before purchasing.
I LOVE this carrier.  When the baby is getting fussy, I throw him in the carrier and I do the house work.  And to go shopping, its great b/c you don't have to worry about a bulky stroller.  I love all the adjustments.  It fits much like a good backpack.  And the baby is so comfy in it.  For the price, you can't beat it!
I received the Snugli as a shower gift and it is a wonderful product.  I like that it is versatile and I will be able to use it not only for my newborn but as she gets older.  My baby likes to be snuggled so this is ideal. I carry her around and can get things done in the home.
Our 2 month old just recently started &#34;noticing&#34; his mobile and he loves it!  I catch him smiling and cooing at the pictures.  I'm anxious to see how much more he responds to it.It's easy to install and has a great look in the nursery.
Keeps baby entertained for long periods of time.  Baby is happy means mommy and daddy are happy.  Very good for eye development.  It attaches to the crib very securely but if for some reason it should fall, it is so light that I would not be worried.
It is a pain to change out the cards and to even get them to sit how they are supposed to. I felt like I was going to break it or permanently bend the cards when I changed them out causing me to do it less than I originally wanted to. I do love that I can change the height of how it hangs so it is always just right for the development. There is a great variety of cards and easily connected to our crib and even pack n play. It comes apart and stores very well until we are ready to use it again with another child. I would buy this again if I no longer had it for some reason.
4 out of 5 starts becuase it is very cheap card connectors.  They don't always stay perpendicular to one another, sometimes they are more &#34;paralell&#34; due to cheap connectors.  I loved this product and have let 3 friends borrow it for their newborns.  Perfect at around 5 weeks to put in crib to simply entertain baby for a while.
As an ophthalmologist, I can attest to the functional utility of this product.  Newborns truly are drawn to high contrast patterns--but this product is so poorly made I would not recommend it.  The plastic cards are badly made--3 of them were broken straight out of the box such that I had to use tape to put them back together.  In addition, the holes in the card to attach to the main apparatus are inconsistent so that some fit too loosely and are easily knocked off while others are so tight I can't get them attached.  If motivated, you could probably make your own sturdier mobile--the patterns are available online.
I had my doubts, but after observing baby staring at this thing for a while it became obvious that she was really interested in the crazy shapes and high contrasting colors.  There are many extra cards that you can change out to keep it interesting.  I think this baby mobile gets it right.  Its light weight so even if it were to fall on her or have some kind of accident she'd be just fine.  The only gripe I have is that it has a very specific type of attachment, you pretty much have to use it on a crib with slats, the shoulder sits on the top rail of the crib.  Well I don't have that, so I have to attach it to something else and mess with the dangle length to get it right in her line of sight.  Changing out cards is a bit fussy and it breaks easily, so be careful.
I like the simple design of this mobile but the plastic parts are a little flimsy and may break easily.  Some of the cards are a little difficult to attach without pushing hard and we already broke one piece while assembling it.  Fortunately we were able to glue the piece back together.We were just looking for a simple mobile for our baby and we hope this will meet our needs.  It's about half of the price of some of the ones sold at other baby stores so I'm not too concerned about wasting my money.
This mobile works wonderfully. Our child is fascinated with it and it keeps him engaged for a reasonable amount of time. However, the plastic feels cheap and flimsy. It's quite frustrating to swap the cards on the mobile as well as flipping them.
You can spend a lot more on a mobile, but this one's a better value.  You won't use a mobile for very long so save your money for something else.  You'll need it.  My son loved to look at this mobile.  Sometimes I'd tie a soft ribbon to the mobile, and the other end to his hand or foot, and he'd make the mobile move all by himself (while supervised of course).  You can change the pictures from time to time.  The pictures face down towards the baby, which is nice.  We were very pleased.
This is the best thing I got for my child! I received it as a gift and have given it to all my new mom friends as well. It is extremely stimulating and love how engaging it is.
I must admit that my daughter enjoyed looking at this  mobile for the first couple months of her life. My complaint is that the product is flimsy for the price. The holes punched in the cards were so small that when hooked onto the arms of the mobile they cracked (many arrived already cracked). The arms and cards tend to fall off if accidentally touched even slightly. And the cards are somewhat translucent so you can see the image on the reverse as well.
This mobile kept my daughter entertained for hours starting around 10 weeks old.  She just stares and talks to the mobile, allowing me to get things done around the house.  Order with the JL Childress Crib Mobile Attachment Clamp and it fits any rock n play or play-yard.
FOR AGE: I got it when my baby was 4mo. Now she is almost 6mo but still love to watch it.I LOVE IT BECAUSE: Clean design. Simple graphics. Solid basic colors. Black, White and Red are absolute hit with my baby (probably most babies).REVIEWS: The reviews on amazon were great and very helpful too. I also researched online, this was a highly recommended mobile.PRODUCT INFO & MY BELIEF: Even though its very simple as compared to many available, it serves the purpose just fine and price is great too. It doesn't have any motor to make cool sounds or motion but then I have other toys which can do that. I like simple products for babies because I feel that's what they really need for developing various skills. Based on my research (and I do lot of it before buying anything for my baby), the simple and solid color graphics are great for Infant's development. And, I believe buying most expensive products for my baby will not make me a better parent. It has extra cards to change. Very easy and intuitive to assemble.EXPERIENCE: First time when I put it on the crib, my baby was extremely excited. She yelled out of excitement for probably 2hrs. It was lot of fun watching and listening to her making funny sounds. Now, she also enjoys to stand with support and try to grab the cards. The look on her face proves its a great buy for us. Highly recommended!
This is a GREAT mobile!  I used it for her changing table and she loved it from 1 month to now almost 4 months of age.  Keeps her still and captivated at the same time!  I subtracted 1 star because it's very difficult to change the photos, they are interlocked too tightly that you have to bend and manuever a lot to get it to slip out.  Some of them you can't even face downwards because it doesn't have a hole for that option.
This product came with the wrong parts and it is unusable without the correct parts. The two plastic parts that make the cross which the cards hang from were incorrect. There are supposed to be two different parts and this one came with two of the same part.
When my baby was 5 weeks I printed off some stimulation images from the internet and taped them to the bottom of the shelf over his changing area.He LOVED (and still does at 3mos) looking at them.Once he started smiling and cooing at them, I decided I needed something similar for his co-sleeper.This mobile by Manhattan fits the bill perfectly.I don't miss having a music box or motorized movement. Baby's excited kicks shake it gently, which is great from a developmental perspective.Cons:~Very tricky to attach to a co-sleeper...a clap base would be handier.I SUPPOSE you could cut and paste your own images to pieces of hard plastic and fashion a mobile yourself, but for $20 it's worth saving your time and simply purchasing this mobile.Baby loves staring at it in the morning while I get ready.
We hang this mobile over our changing table.  It keeps the babies entertained and occupied during diaper changes.  The interchangeable cards are nice for keeping things interesting.My only complaint is that the cards can be tricky to change.This is now my go-to gift for new arrivals.
Simple design - easy to put together - interesting concept.  Our infant son seemed to like it (or at least reached for it when it was above him.)  A nice change from the cheesy, lights & flash items that are out there.The arm attaches by a plastic &#34;vise&#34; -- it doesn't look sturdy but it worked pretty well.  And you can change the images as your child develops -- so you can change it up.  At this point in our son's development it's probably  just decorative, but for now I'm still keeping on his crib -- can't hurt to keep it up. :)
Simple without lights and music that can be too much stimulation in a bed. I got this for my grandaughter, who had vision problems. It immediately attracted her gaze, and continues to do so. It allows changing height by removing links as vision range increases. Cost is very reasonable.
I didnt have any issues with the cards wripping, and thought it was a great product. My little newbie LOVES looking at it and I would tell every mom to get one of these. My only complaint, I have to "Jimmy Rig" it to stay on the side of his pack and play or bassinet... It would be nice if it wasnt built just to go in between slats on the crib.
I like the idea of this mobile and would have definitely liked it if it was made a little better. But the whole thing seems kind of cheap and plastic-y. The way two cards are put together causes one of them to split a little in the middle and the cards don't really hang down straight. I ended up returning the mobile because it just didn't fulfill its purpose due to its poor quality. If it was cheaper it'd probably be ok. I don't know why something so innovative that being recommended on so many websites wouldn't be of higher quality!?
I wanted something simple for my baby's crib and this mobile was perfect!  It comes with a lot of cards and all are two-sided so you can mix and match what your baby looks at and change things up.  They are a bit difficult to adjust but really that's just being nit-picky to complain about.  I liked the quality of this mobile and the images were a perfect blend of black and white, color, basic lines and more complicated shapes and images.  We have this put away with our baby things so we can use it again if and when we decide to have another baby.  Our (currently seven month old) baby enjoyed it from about two months old through five and a half months old before being a bit &#34;over&#34; it.  I don't think you're supposed to keep any mobile much past that age, so it seemed right in line with everything else.  If you want something that is visually stimulating and good for brain development without all of the extraneous music, movement and other things that aren't actually as good for babies then this is it.  It's interesting without being over stimulating for little brains--and big brains, too, whenever I looked at it myself.  It also attached very easily to the crib.  I would definitely buy this again!
Our infant loves the pictures on this mobile (he is 8-weeks old).  The black, white, red contrast is excellent for drawing baby's attention and the images are simple and clean for him to study (AKA smile, coo, and make gooby faces at while kicking and shaking his fists).Keeps him interested for about ten minutes without complaints and when he starts to fuss we can often turn the mobile to get him engaged all over again.This comes with extra cards so you can change them out keeping it new and exciting.There are no lights, sounds, or motion.
I bought this product when my baby was 4 weeks old thinking I could use it at birth. She wouldn't even look at it. I thought I had wasted my money.Then, around 7 weeks she started really enjoying it. She is 10 weeks now and she will lay in her co-sleeper staring at the cards, smiling and talking to them. It is so awesome seeing her have so much fun with this.I love how you can change the cards because it keeps her interested, even though I haven't had to change them out much.Yes, the product could be made better and you have to be gentle when switching out the cards, but for the price, it is absolutely 5 stars.Another thing I really love is that I can use it with my co-sleeper with an added cost. I bought the JL Childress crib mobile attachment clamp for $12.99. If you buy them together, shipping is free.I don't have a crib and wanted a great mobile but none were compatible with my arm's reach co-sleeper. With the clamp, this STIMulating mobile is one of the best purchases I've made for my baby.
This Mobile is perfect for newborns.  We hung this over our changing table, and our daughter was in love.  She would smile, and talk to this mobile.  It often got more smiles than we did.
You wouldn't think to look at this mobile, but for a small baby it is very entertaining.  I bought this for our son when he was 6 weeks old.  We have black and white images taped on the wall right next to his changing table and he would stare at them for what seemed like forever, about 10 minutes :)  I saw this while looking for another product and decided to give it a try, I'm so glad we did!  My son is mesmerized by this every time I change him, even now 4 1/2 months, especially when I switch out a few cards.  I love that this is not too expensive since it can only be used for a short time, and I really like that it doesn't have any sounds or music.  Some play music automatically, usually too loud, and I would rather decide my own background music.A few complaints:  In my opinion the cards are somewhat difficult to change, and there should be a larger selection of colored pictures for the older babies who don't enjoy black and white images as much anymore.  Biggest grief we've had with this:  we have our changing table in the bathroom underneath a towel bar we initially used to hang teether and toys from.  I wanted to attach this mobile for use while changing since we don't use a crib, but it is only intended for crib attachment and would not work as it was.  We modified it by taking off the screw-on clamp and using small plastic (but strong) clamps to hold the top flat section onto the towel bar, which has straight sides all around.  If you bought or are thinking of buying this for use somewhere other than a crib, you can do what we did or buy a clamp-type mobile hanger.  We have the JL Childress Crib Mobile Attachment Clamp, which I purchased after modifying this mobile and which I have used since then.  It will grab onto a variety of widths and then lock, though honestly we had no problems with our modified attachment and it was just a matter of aesthetics for us.  Overall this is a great idea for a mobile and we really enjoy it!
Cute, easy to assemble, very stimulating to my child... I love this product! It's not the more expensive but keep my son amazed with the colors and patterns
I am very happy with this purchase . The arm comes with this FYI to anyone wondering . It's very easy to assemble and I  like the different options of cards.  Great price , will recommend to family/friends. Beats paying $80 plus for a mobile .
Wish I could give it 5 stars but the construction issues others have referenced prevent that.  It's just unnecessarily hard to clamp and unclamp the pieces from each other and from the mobile.  And why don't they make it so all pieces can be used either vertically or horizontally, that would give more versatility.  But still, it's amazing to watch how our baby is mesmerized by the patterns, just totally engrossed.  Love it despite the construction issues.
When we bought this our baby was 3 months old. We put it on the changing table and she loved to look at it - it would keep her from getting fussy during clothing and diaper changes. Now she is 5 months old and she is obsessed with grabbing it and putting the cards in her mouth. She can only reach it if we pick her up and bring her over to it while we hold her, but when we do she practically lunges out of our arms for it. She reaches out for it any time we carry her past the changing table. We can't get over how much she likes it! I also use the extra images as flashcards and she loves them that way, too (though not as much as the mobile). It is a little hard to put together, it's true, but it is doable. They could improve that feature but even so I would recommend this product.
If you want to purchase a mobile that will entertain, stimulate and teach your child (rather than something that matches your nursery decor), buy this mobile.  My infant has loved this from day one and cannot get enough of the pictures.  As my son co-sleeps with us, I started by attaching the mobile to his changing table.  I even took some of the extra cards and would place them around him while he was awake to give him something to look at.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it could be constructed a bit better.  The cards are difficult to disassemble and could probably be made better.  However, this is a product that is only meant to be used for a short period of time and it serves it's purpose well.  Do your child a favor and skip the cutesy animal mobile...buy this instead!
Really like the mobile and option to change out the discs.  Just really hard to.
February 2011, 3 stars:I was excited when one of my friends purchased this mobile off our registry for us because I'd read such excellent things about it.  Well, it arrived yesterday.  I put it together last night and here is my review.I want to like it.  I love the idea of the interchangeable high-contrast cards to keep a baby interested.  I knew it didn't have a motor and planned to have a fan circulating air in the nursery, which would move the cards a little bit.  I knew people had had breakage troubles with some of the parts so I was careful in my assembly and indeed did not break anything.  However, it still falls short of what I'd hoped for.First, I agree with other reviewers that it is very cheaply made.  The various plastic components are different shades of "white" (one reviewer said the arm and crib attachment were lavender and that's about right).Second, the crib attachment piece is non-adjustable.  If your crib slats or edges are too skinny or too wide (like mine is), it simply will not fit.  However, I imagine if your crib is too skinny you could find something to act as a spacer and get it to wedge on there just fine.Third, as mentioned, the mobile doesn't fit on my crib.  I have the Baby Mod Park Lane crib from Walmart and the edge panel of the crib is just slightly too wide for this mobile to fit.  For the time being, I have figured out a much less secure way to attach it, but we will probably just end up trashing the plastic arm and crib attachment piece and hanging the mobile itself from the ceiling.Fourth, as other reviewers have mentioned, you'd think that all of the cards would be interchangeable but they're not.  Some cards are designed to be vertical and some are designed to be horizontal.  Therefore, your selection of cards to display to the baby is limited to only the fronts & backs of the horizontally-designed cards.  I'm not sure what the purpose of the vertical cards is other than to look pretty for Mom and Dad.Fifth, it *is* difficult to switch the cards out.  Because I knew that people had broken theirs, I took my time and tried not to force anything.  It definitely required a bit of patience and some twisting/turning this way and that. Fortunately, I was successful and did not break any of the tabs off the cards but I can see how it would be easy to.Sixth, the notches of the vertical cards inserted into the slits of the horizontal cards (the ones baby sees) is a very tight fit.  This causes the horizontal cards to sit at an angle.  I am crossing my fingers that these "joints" will loosen and relax over time, perhaps if I take a few minutes to wiggle them each a little bit whenever I think of it.Like I said, I want to like this mobile.  I love the concept and the images are pretty cool.  However, I wish the crib attachment fit my crib.  I wish that all of the cards could be used horizontally rather than only half of them.  I wish the plastic arm and crib attachment didn't look so cheap.  And I hope the plastic cards relax a little so that the images hang straight down rather than at an angle.  If I have my husband hang this from the ceiling and remove the plastic arm and crib attachment I will eliminate two of these problems so that's what I will probably do.I'm really glad my friend only paid $11 for this.  That's about as much as I would feel comfortable having paid or having had someone else pay for this right now given its limitations.***UPDATE 11/30/12***I just wanted to update that my husband and I did end up hanging this mobile from the ceiling on a small hook via clear fishing line (very light-weight) and it actually worked quite well. My son LOVED this mobile for months so I switched out the cards regularly to keep him stimulated. Around 5-6 weeks, he started doing his "exercises" for about 20 min. straight at a time where he'd just lie under the mobile and kick and wiggle like crazy as it gently spun. We tossed the plastic arm and crib attachment that came with the mobile but the mobile itself really did prove its value. I've saved it for #2.Btw, as our son got older and was able to reach out to the mobile, we simply tied the mobile higher up the line. Simple. We kept doing that until he was able to stand and reach it and then we just cut it down.I have increased this product to 4 stars because, in the end, it ended up doing what we had hoped it would do.
I love the simple. high-contrast images that are so great for a baby's development. My baby loves looking at this mobile. I just wish it were available with a motor to move it. I don't like that it only moves if I stand there and move it. If my baby could be entertained by this on her own for ten minutes, I could go take a quick shower or do some laundry while she's in her crib, happy, but because I have to be there to move it, I can't do that. I still really like this mobile, but I ended up replacing it with another high-contrast mobile that moves and plays classical music when turned on.It's of course worth noting that it's so inexpensive because it doesn't have any electronic parts, so for the price, you really can't get a better mobile. It also comes with two sets of images: high contrast black-and-white, and high contrast color.
Our six week old daughter loves this mobile.  We had a stuffed animal mobile that she ignored; when I replaced it with this mobile she showed excitement by waving her arms and legs, and started to smile and coo at the mobile.  I used the rotating clamp that was on the old mobile so that the figures spin around slowly; when it stops, she starts fussing for it to be wound up again :)
We have this hanging above the crib at baby's daycare and even though he's been there about 4 months now, it still mesmerizes him when we drop him off in the mornings. We switch pictures very occasionally, and twirl it a little as we leave and that seems to be enough. The plastic link chain is adjustable and the arch is higher than the other baby mobiles at the daycare (mostly symphony in motions, which we have at home but he gets tired of very quickly) so I love the proximity to baby's face. However, the cards are hooked to each other very poorly and the ones facing baby will not lay flat. He can still see them, but it bugs me. Also, if we aren't careful when we lean down to give him a kiss, we always end up knocking off a card or two, since they are lightly balanced on little plastic hook-things. This is a bit annoying. Still, the cards are light and will not hurt baby when they fall and the benefits of this toy far far outweigh the little annoyances.
My husband and I jokingly call this mobile our baby's &#34;best friend.&#34; We have it hanging above her changing table, and she smiles, coos and squeals with delight every time we lay her beneath it. She cries when we lift her off the table. The only problem with this product is that you may become jealous of the loving attention that your baby pays it, instead of you.
Originally, we bought two of the Fisher Price Rainforest-something-or-other mobiles for our twin sons.  They were cute.  They played music and lit up and spun, but they kept blowing through batteries.  When the boys were three months old, both mobiles began breaking down--no matter how many batteries we put in, they just wouldn't work properly--and the boys were in the hospital for seven weeks due to being premature, so we really didn't have those mobiles up and running for that long.  In any case, I decided to go with a non-battery powered option, and found these.First, let me say that one of them arrived missing parts--the thing that screws on to hold it onto the side of the crib was MIA.  Annoying, and Amazon would've exchanged it, but instead I hijacked parts from the old FP mobile, and it seems fine.  Second, those little cards are a PITA to swap out.  I followed the directions, but it was still difficult, to say the least.BUT, the reason I gave it four stars anyway, despite the missing parts and the PITA card-swapping, is that these things have changed my life.Instead of waking and SCREAMING to be taken out of his crib, our "testy" twin can now occupy himself for half and hour to an hour while I drink a cup of coffee, wake up, and catch up on last night's unfinished housework.  It is absolutely wonderful.  Because the mobiles don't light up, this self-amusing feature only works when the boys can see them, but it really is truly, truly wonderful.And that's why I didn't want to exchange the mobile that was missing parts--I didn't want to part with it, if even only for a few days.  Right now, as I type this review, he is in his crib giggling and cooing, and not screaming.I love you, mobile.  You are my hero.
We attached this to my kitchen counter and its great, no need for a high chair. Definitely a must buy
This chair is awesome! It is well made and works great. Our daughter fits great and she loves sitting at the table with us. We were happy to find out it is made in the USA in Burnsville, MN! Love this chair and thinking about ordering another just to keep it in the car.
I had this seat with my 3rd child but someone borrowed it and broke one of the bars. My 4th is now old enough for one of these seats so I ordered the pink Inglesina seat, only because it was pink and the arms that go under the table on the Regalo don't seem to fit many tables.  The Inglesina seat has shorter arms but is more money and it doesn't offer the 5 point harness, my 10 month old crawled out of it and was on the table within minutes of putting her in it!  Sent the Inglesina back and ordered another Regalo.  The Regalo is a nice seat but as I said, doesn't fit a lot of tables very easily.
I bought this high chair for traveling to grandmas houses. It didn't fit my mothers table or my mothers-in-laws table either. We had to use it on the outside patio table. After a few uses it broke. When it did fit the table it wasn't bad.
Took this to London where the flats are tiny! It worked perfectly for my daughter and can easily store when not in use! It also laid flat in my suitcase so it wasn't hard to pack. The seat board is kind of cheap, like a thick cardboard, but it doesn't effect the ability to support my baby its still very sturdy so I still give it 5 stars. Easy to wash and overall a very convenient product.
This won't work on most tables that have a skirt or that expand as the skirt and the slide rails for expansion get in the way.
I bought this high chair over three months ago and so far it has been awesome! It has held up very well with no signs of wear and tear. The material used is soft and easy to clean. This high chair is extremely easy to set up and nice for travel. It comes with a carrying case which has proven to be very useful for me. The chair folds down in half the size  and takes me literally 30 seconds. The chair easily fits over tables with lips. Both arms fold down and lock back in place to work on tables with lips. Also, the high chairs arms look slightly bent at an angle but this actually is a useful feature. I enjoy the safety of the three point harness that allows me to leave the table without worrying that my little on will try to climb out. Most of all he seems to enjoy the high chair while sitting with us at the table. Overall, great quality, affordability, usefulness and accessibility makes this high chair a must have!
I was looking for a chair to use at grandma's house, and ordered this one. At home we use the Phil and Ted's Me Too everywhere we go, and love it in every way. We like to have the baby at the table with us. The Regalo is clunky, difficult to install, the fabric feels cheap, the baby sits too low and his head hits the metal piping on the top of the chair. He cries whenever I put him in it. This chair is going back.
I really should've read the reviews on this, but I didn't see how I could go wrong. It's described very well and the pictures really sell it. I think I may have gotten one of the defective ones because the arms that I got did not look like the arms in the instruction booklet. There was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length. Once I put it together, there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table. It stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further. I hope I have better luck with the next brand I try because I hate the 5' tall rolling highchair that we got as a present. For now, I am content with the bumbo. Amazon is going to take it back as defective and refund me the shipping.
Our son really likes to watch and participate in the kitchen.  We can hang this chair from our island so he feels like he is in the middle of all the action.  Happy baby equals happy momma/daddy.  Our son is on the upper end of the growth chart at 16 months and it still works for him.
I bought this chair for my 5 month old to go out to dinner with.  So far it has worked great and it is easy to use and carry with us.  I would recommend it.
We bought this high chair for travel purposes after realizing that the height of the tables and highchairs in most restaurants were not very compatible for our baby eating food off the table.  This chair is easy to transport (though it doesn't fold flat, like you might think it should) and hook on to most tables; we haven't had a problem installing it yet.  We've began using this with our 8 month old, and it looks like it will fit her for quite a while.  She likes to wiggle around in the &#34;free floating&#34; seat, so it keeps her busy when her food is gone as well!  I'd give it 5 stars if only it folded all the way flat.
Easy to use and lightweight.  I've used at about 10 different restaurants so far and never had a problem.  It's nice, too, because the lining comes out if you need to wash it.  My daughter is 1 year old, 21 lb, 28 inches and she fits well in it.  I can probably use another 6 more months, hopefully more.
I want to start by saying that these chairs can go for $35 and up to $80! So, to get it for $18 is a steal!This thing is amazing! It's perfect! It exceeded my expectations!I didn't buy this to use with my own table BUT it has a 4in lip around it, and it would still work if I needed it to. It clips to my kitchen bar, and it clips to my husband's desk! (He has one of those heavy, solid wood desks it takes two men to lift)I bought this SOLELY to use in booths in restaurants. I have friends whose babies were in the restaurant high chair and got a hot plate food spilled on them by a waiter, and another had a patron bump into their kid because they weren't watching where then are going, so I do NOT want my kid in rickety old wooden high chair, in the narrow aisle of a dimly lit public place. This is not my idea of safe. I'd MUCH rather her be IN the booth between me and my husband, or me and the wall, depending on the size of the booth and how many people we are dining out with.Is is PERFECT! It only takes up just enough space, AND there is plenty of room, and it has a 5pt harness! My baby is 22.5 lbs and 2.5 feet tall, and it very comfortable, with room to spare. She sits unassisted, and does NOT slip around.And the seat cushion is removable by velcro, so you can wash it! Love it! That was a pleasant surprise!I just love it! I just wish I'd bought it sooner, and if it doesn't last til the next kid, I'll buy this same exact one again.***About the reviews that say it doesn't fit, they are wrong! When you put it on the counter, table, etc. it won't be flush. It will lean forward a great deal. Once you fold the arms up and TIGHTEN THE ARMS it will slowly become flush with the table and be locked in. I know it seems like it won't fit, but I promise it does! You just have to tighten the arms. I'll post pics to show what I mean.
We got it for the price and unfortunately, we paid the price! It does not fit most tables and it's a huge pain to put on and off! We regret it! We bought a fisherprice booster with a tray and love it! Don't waste your money!
I had a chair like this for my kids and decided for the price it was well worth it to purchase it for my grandchild. Portable- goes anywhere and I know there were reviews about tables with trim under the top but mine worked just fine there. I was able to get the chair over the trim. The chair is easy to clean as well.  Great invention-this chair!
Purchased them for our 11 month old twins, 18 pounds. Work nice but have had trouble fitting under table certain tables. Which it would work with most. Now looking for alternative at Grandparents without needing regular highchairs.
I bought this with some hesitation. The reviewer that stated that her daughter fell out because the velcro gave way had me worried. But, I also spent some time on the Regalo website and reviewed the literature before I made a decision.First, I would like to address the Velcro issue- This is NON-issue. The Velcro DOES NOT HOLD ON THE SEAT. In order to put the chair together, one has to loop the upper arms of the chair through the CORRECT loop. The loop is about 4" wide and has triple stitching with industrial thread. I can see how one might get confused and simply Velcro the seat to the metal arms... but that would be incorrectly installing it. the Velcro exists only to keep the "chushy" part of the chair connected to the rest of the seat. The cushy part can be tossed in the washing machine. I used the chair without the cushy part this afternoon because it was drying on the line. It's for comfort not function. The main seat with the loops does all the work.I use this chair at my kitchen island so my son can watch me prep meals while he colors, eats lunch, or plays with something messy. It's very easy to use. Simple to take apart for washing. Wipes down pretty well. It takes about 2 minutes to assemble (don't forget to put the arms through the secure loops). And it's non-obtrusive- I have it installed at the counter and it sticks out about 6" which is less than the counter stools that sit next to it. I love that I can take it off and slide it under the sofa or into my backpack when I need it for the road or out of sight for guests. The fabric construction feels very sturdy. We borrowed an Eddie Bauer hook-on chair and I found that to be much more rickety than the Rigalo chair. I don't tend to keep the chair in place for very long, but I have noticed that it's best to check the latch arm under the chair to make sure it's still secure BEFORE every 3rd use.I knew it wouldn't work at our dining room table because the table has a large apron. But, NONE of the hook-on chairs can handle aprons very well. I also don't suspect that this will work past his 3rd birthday. That's a full year and a half away... so from a value stand-point this works GREAT!
I bought this to use at my folks' place since they babysit one day a week. Our 5 month old is still a little small for it so we put blankets around him. He seems to like it and doesn't seem uncomfortable. My parents love that it doesn't take up much room, and they can still put one of their dining room chairs underneath it when not in use, so it doesn't take up any space. Very sturdy, great price.
I wanted an easy to use travel seat.  This seat does not fold up as easily as I expected--you have to dismantle it and remove the arms in order to take the seat apart and get it to lay flat.  That's a step that I wasn't expecting.  On our first use, it would not attach securely to the table that we were at.  I could get it on the table, but the angle between the part that goes above and below the table did not allow for the seat to be pushed forward toward the table enough so that the seat was secure.  The seat might have been safe, but I didn't trust it, and in any case, there would have been a large gap between the baby and the table and I'm sure any food would have went straight into that gap onto baby's lap or the floor.I wish I would have spent a few dollars more and gotten the chicco seat that my friends have.  That seat works very well and folds flat with ease.  This seat was not a good purchase.
I don't have babies anymore, they are too old for high chairs.  I do babysit on a regular basis though and I love this high chair.  It's so easy to put up and take down.  So when baby goes home for the day, this unhooks from the island very easy.  It's easy to store away and it's portable.  So I can take it with us when we go out to eat.  Love it!
I'm a bit confused by some of the reviews stating this doesn't work for tables with skirts, because our table has a skirt that's 4-5" and the Regalo hooks on over it just fine. There are two adjustments made when installing the chair: press the buttons to release the hooks under the table, and there are pieces you can unscrew to loosen them as well. Do all this before trying to install the chair over a skirt -- make sure the hooks underneath are loosened, and not locked in place. We've taken the Regalo on vacation with us, and it worked great on every table we used it at (condos, cabins, restaurants -- you name it). It also folds up and comes with its own carry bag, which is very handy.This chair has been awesome for us! Our (then) 9-month-old refused to sit in the traditional high chair we had. The tray adjusted in increments, so in order to have it snug enough so she couldn't climb out, it was too tight for her to be comfortable. Even as she got older, I could never turn my back on her in the high chair because she was determined to escape.So we looked at several other more portable high chairs (but didn't have the money to invest in a new freestanding high chair). Despite some of the negative reviews for this one, we decided to give it a shot. And I am SO GLAD we did! She sat down deeper in it, so it was impossible for her to climb out. It's got a 5 point harness (unlike the high chair we had) which makes me feel better. And she got to be right at the table with everyone else at mealtime. It also worked great for when she and her big sister wanted to color or paint at the table. My toddler got to be included, and that helped make meals and family time much nicer for us all.My daughter is now almost two years old, and we only recently moved her from this to a booster seat (one of those cheapy ones without a tray). We definitely got our money's worth with the Regalo.I highly recommend it! The only cons that I've found:- It's a minor annoyance to clean the area close to the rubber grippers on top of the table. But it's not a big deal really; I just loosen it up a big, clean around and under the rubber bits, then lock it back in place. The nylon material is very easy to keep clean, though.- If your toddler is a climber, once s/he is big enough, it is possible to pull arms out from the shoulder straps, and stand up on the chair. So keep an eye on on your toddlers once they're old enough to start doing this, and make sure the straps are snug.
We went to visit relatives with our new baby for an extended vacation and had no idea what we'd need - after day 1 I realized we needed a high chair STAT.  I hopped on my iphone and bought this thru the Amazon ap, using our Prime membership to get it next day to where we were.  For the price I had low expectations.  This thing is worth every penny.  Easy to use, stable, sturdy, comfy and it made feeding time so much easier!
It latches onto the breakfast counter or table tightly and is nicely padded.  Very handy for a picnic with a little one or a trip somewhere when you don't want to drag along a high chair.  Takes up very little space as it folds up!
What a great deal this chair is!  Our 9 month old loves dining out with us now, he feels like a big boy sitting next to daddy at restaraunts.  We clip this onto the tables right next to us, not at the end of the tables where babies usually have to sit.  I feel great knowing my baby is sitting in a clean chair, safely next to us and super happy.  First time we used it he smiled so big and it made us feel so good that we bought this.  We keep this in the car for all our trips, best deal out there!  We have no complaints or issues with this chair so far, totally recommend!
Easy to set up, sturdy and comfy for our 7 mo (19 lb). Not practical to be taken to restaurants etc but great to leave it at the table so she can start joining us during meals. The baby sits pretty close to the table, same as an adult chair. Not much padding, it's mainly nylon with some filling so not sure how long it will last but so far she is happy sitting there.
I wanted some type of personal highchair to use when dining in a restaurant.Bringing baby in car seat is heavy and takes up too much space. Using a restaurant highchair??? NO WAY!! I shopped for some time before deciding to order one of the less expensive models just in case it might not work out. Well, I am convinced that I got a really great product regardless of price! I have tried it on every type of table and it always attaches safely. Baby loves it because she is at the table with everyone.Now, taking baby out to eat is a pleasure for all of us! I think that this dining seat would be a terrific and useful  gift .
I have been holding onto this item for so long now.  I have not sent it back because I have not had the time,  However, I have not used it because it does not feel very secure and doesn't fit to any of my tables or restaurants, etc.  The material annoys me.  Although it seems easy to clean, it's very cheap.  However, I new that the item was inexpensive and tried my luck.  It just sits at the bottom of my stairs staring at me each morning waiting for me to return it.
We bought one of these from BB&B; about a year and a half ago when my now 2-year-old was about 7 months and too wiggly to be fed in her bouncy chair any longer.  We have plenty of room for a high chair, but they're just so unattractive and huge that I started looking for other options.  Debated between this and a booster-style chair that sits in your existing chairs and I must say for young kids, this is the way to go!  It sat attached to our island pretty much nonstop until recently when I've decided to move her to a regular chair...now it sits waiting for our 4-month-old to be big enough to use it.  After so much use, the pad is a bit worn but otherwise still looks great.My only complaints are:*It is a PAIN to keep clean - the handles can get filthy since they are right there next to the food, the front strap gets a lot of spills on it, and most of the seat is fabric so it takes a little more than a quick wipe down.  I've thrown the pad in the washer a number of times though, just the straps are pretty much impossible to get completely clean since they are attached to the frame.*It doesn't fit on my dining table with a 4" skirt and a 3" lip - I knew that was pretty likely though so I wasn't too disappointed, but it would have been nice to eat at our table rather than the island bar.  But I think it would attach to *most* tables.Now that my daughter is older, I'm worried she is going to dive out of it one of these days (have had a few close calls now that she can undo the straps) & being that it is so high off the ground where we have it, we've moved her to a a regular chair with a booster.  But for older babies/young toddlers, it is awesome & just as nice as the much more expensive ones.
We bought this thinking that we would prefer its high back to the Phil and Teds lobster chair. Though this was much less expensive, the material is cheap and the unit was annoying to set up. It didn't fit either of our tables, so back it goes.
We got this for our nine month old son and he loves to feel like he's eating with the family. Does the job great and is easy to move around and clean.
This is exactly what I wanted!! Loved the vivid colors and the style and feel of the fabric. Perfect size for me.
Nice way to keep extras. We still have some in top drawer of changing table as well. This is great because you are not caught changing a dirty diaper and trying to open a pack of diapers.
I purchased this diaper stacker for our pending arrival.  The material is sturdy and easily hung along the side of our changing table.  However, I wanted to integrate more green into the room so I ended up returning this stacker and purchasing a Twiddlinks one.
I have purchased the majority of the items available from this collection and they are all fantastic. Worth the money.
The look of the stacker is cute, although the strings are somewhat of an eye sore and really stand out against the wall.  The strings are the plush material and easily come undone so not a good idea to hang directly over the crib or changing table.
This bag is ALOT larger than it seems in the picture. It fits comfortably across the side of my daughter's crib and I use it to put in small toys and what not for easy reach when we/ she needs them. It's not clear but the simpler ones are actually a checkered pattern, I guess you can see it if you look closely. All in all, a great idea and it serves its purpose very well. I would definitely recommend it for a nursery as a must have, where else can you put small toys for an easy reach? Maybe in the future, they will start including them in the crib bedding set like they do with the diaper stackers.
Has worked well for me.  Still need a hat during cold weather, but otherwise works for basic back and forth travel.  Not really good for extended trips outside in cold weather w/o coat and hat.
When picking items out for our twins we came across the Bundle Me It felt so warm and cozy inside almost like a big blanket! So we reg for both a pink for our girl and blue for our son. Im so happy we did. It getting cold here in WI and sooner the snow will be flying. This is already coming in handy. Since me and my husband LOVE to walk on weekends or nights after work we have used this now a few times when its chilly. No need for blankets or jackets. And now with winter right around the corner this will come in great! We take them out everyday to their grandparents home. This will keep them warm and out of the wind. We have the Graco infant carseats, the Eddie Bauer infant carseats and their grandparents also have Graco seats. They fit so easily in all of them. And mornings when i take the babies over i just take them right out of the carseat right in the bundle me. Its just like a big fuzzy jacket, that they can use when they go out with gampa/grama. Its alot easier than trying to get 2 jackets, mittens hats,etc on 2 6 month olds. All around this is GREAT product and im so happy i have them!
We got this for our son when he was 1 yr old, and it looks brand new, a year later. Our child is of average size, and he's got plenty of room in it, at age 2. We live in a major city, so our stroller gets A LOT of use. This blanket is very durable, grows with your child, and keeps them warm and comfy in the coldest temperatures. Stays in place, and is easy to install/remove.
The bundle me for toddlers is a great product. We also own the infant bundle me and it was perfect as well for both car seat and stroller. Now we got the toddler version and it's pretty long to be able to fit our son until he's much older (he's now 17 months) and keeps him nice and warm. No need for blankets that fall or fly off. Perfect!
The bundleme is super comfy and my toddler seems to stay warm and happy when in it.  It's nice that it can easily attach to a stroller.  At first I thought 'why wouldn't I just use a blanket?'  But this wraps around the whole babe-a good investment for cold weather walks.
I purchased this set at a local baby store about a year ago. I do not use the valve cleaner basket at all since it is very cumbersome to use.  It clips on so it seems to be floating above the rack and takes up a lot of room and it has very little useable space inside.  However, I have been using the other two baskets everyday for about 10 months now. I useDr. Brown's 3 Pack BPA Free Polypropylene Bottle, 8 ozthat have a long tube, so the larger basket is perfect for them (I just line up the top of the tube with the holes in the top of the basket so it is held in the upright position).  As for the small basket, I do not use the nipple part (which snaps right off) as it seems weird to me to tilt the nipples sideways because they may not get as clean(?). However, this is just a personal preference and not a product defect.  Of course, I am happy that it is made in the USA from 100% recycled material!  I had to deduct one star for the useless valve basket and because the lid of the larger basket comes loose which can be annoying.
Holds the bottle stuff pretty well, but not everything always gets clean because of the way you have to put things in.
All baby bottle supplies fit fine with no issues. Seems sturdy, items come out clean. No complaints.
We purchased this basket because the one we had with my first child finally bit the dust, but was never quite exaxtly what I needed.  This comes as a combo set of 3 baskets which have suggested uses, but what I really like is that of all of the dishwasher baskets I looked at, I had trouble finding a basket that accomodated everything (breastpump parts, bottle accessories, sippy cups, etc).  While these baskets aren't perfect, they offer a lot of versitility.  I can fit Breastflow bottle parts and pumping accessories in these without any trouble.  Most of the previous baskets I've encountered only fit standard sized bottle parts or parts from specific brands.The only feature I wish is contained was a better place to store the straws from the Take and Toss style cups.  These are thin enought that they can fall through the holes unless you have other items in the basket.
I purchasd the combination of the valve basket, the toddler basket and the one with the compartments for the bottle nipples. I didnt find the valve compartment one useful at the time and ended up taking it to goodwill.  Later I wished I had kept it for the sippy cup valves, but the 2 other baskets I have work great.  These are both still going strong after 3 1/2 years.  There is no wear and some days we even do 2 dishwasher loads per day - that is a lot of times that the hinges on these baskets are opened and closed!I use the nipple one for the sippy valves (in the top portion), breast pump accessory parts, plastic spoons, medicine vials and mini-tupperware pieces (such as condiment containers).  The large one I use for sippy lids and anything else.There are just so many uses for these two baskets, that was worth the price of all three, even though I don't use the valve one.
I got these baskets to wash small parts for my Dr. Brown's baby bottles and breast pump parts. They are so handy and useful that I'm now using them for my Aquasana water bottle caps and a variety of other small washable items. One basket has an extra compartment for bottle nipples which is really handy. Overall great buy!
I use Playtex DropIns bottles/nipples, which are larger than average nipples.  These nipples do NOT fit well in the nipple compartment of this dishwasher basket.  I can only wash 3 nipples at a time in this basket.  The latches to open the different compartments are very snug, making it difficult to open them quickly or with only one hand.
So far, so good! I'm using the larger basket in the top rack of my dishwasher for my breast pump accessories. No complaints!
I have two of these dishwasher baskets, but I do not have the valve basket. They can be purchased separately at some stores. I originally bought another type of dishwasher basket that had the bottle nipple compartment on top, but it much more difficult to use. Everytime you opened it to add another nipple, the ones already in there would fall out. These dishwasher baskets are designed allot better. They have the nipple compartment on the bottom for better cleaning and have slots that the bottle nipples fit into. The best aspect, however, is that the nipples do not fall out when the compartment is opened.
I've used the small round one in the dishwasher twice and the clasp that keeps the cover closed snapped off. The hinge seems tight so it might stay closed enough even without the clasp but they're definitely not as sturdy as I'd imagined.
I got this for the little one and use it for sippy cup inserts (I use playtex and they come with small plastic inserts) works well
As an expectant mother, I have been cleaning all of my new baby products.  I quickly realized that I needed something to put pacifiers and smaller items in, so I could just throw them in the dishwasher.  These baskets are perfect for this.  I bought this product with a drying tree, so I could just put the bottles and products on the drying tree after they come out of the dishwasher, and then I can relax!  These are the kinds of things you never think to register for, but is essential to daily life!
I really want to get my twins one of these, I know they are 8 months already but they still use their exersaucers, I rarely use the walker, I thought these would be TERRIFIC. But I was wondering if you can put one of these on the ceiling or something, like does it only have to be in a door way? My husband wants to put 2 in one LARGE doorway, but I feel that would be way to dangerous. Does anyone know if you CAN do that? Has anyone tried? And is a small 8 month old TOO old? I think its great, my friend had one for her son about 10 years ago, and he loved it. PLEASE SOMEONE WRITE A REVIEW ANSWERING ATLEAST SOME OF MY QUESTIONS!UPDATE!We bought this jumpster and it has worked wonders! Yes my 8 month old boys still fit, though they are scrawny, so I wish we got this one earlier. I found that you cant attatch it to the ceiling, the top is like a "claw" and it sort of grabs the molding above a door frame, so its easy to put on and move, if neccessary. If you don't understand what I mean by "claw", go to Graco.com, and find this jumper on their website, than it will show you a video clip if you click on the link, it will explain. The alasticy string will not snap nor will it come off, if installed correctly that is. I can easily pull with all my might and weight and that thing doesnt budge. Its very easy to spot clean the seat, and very easy to adjust the hieght settings. As to whether you can fit two in a fairly large doorway, (mine is 8-10 ft!), the answer is yes, and safely! They are close enough to see eachother but they can not hurt one another. They love bouncing in these things and will for anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour, the same as the exersaucer. So I can alternate, if they seem kind of tired, I put them in the exersaucer to play with the toys, or if they are really excited and happy I put them in the jumpster. Also if you do not care for the Jackpot pattern, there are more available on Graco.com if your buying online. I did not purchase mine online, but at BabiesRus I got this pattern and a jungle pattern. I hope this helps everyone!
I don't know who is having more fun...our baby bouncing around in it, or my husband and me watching him.  From about three months on, he has just adored this.  Couldn't ask for something better!
I bought this when my son was 2 1/2 months. I would sit and help him learn to use his legs and to control his head and body better.  Now at four months he uses it by himself and goes crazy.  He bounces forever!!!  His legs are strong and he is starting to learn to use his legs to stand up and walk.  It is crazy!  The only thing now is that he is taller than average at his age and is quickly outgrowing it. I love this product so much because he just smiles all the time in it.  I hate to see him grow out of it so fast, but he had a great time in it.
My son absolutely loves jumping in the Jumpster! He will even fall asleep in it! I find it to be safe, though you'll need to make sure your baby holds onto the handles.I wish the straps could be further adjusted. If you have a tall baby, he/she may grow out of it too fast.
I know this is a typical design for a doorway bouncer and though my 4 1/2 month old loves it, it needs some improvement. The 3 armed thingie over the seat which is about 2 1/2-3 feet above needs to be higher because since the seat is fabric and pulls right up when trying to get any child out of this it makes it very hard to try and prevent babies head from bopping against the 3 armed thing. Either that needs to be higher or the fabric seat needs to remain in place instead of coming up w/ baby and getting caught on his legs every single time. It's always very very awkward getting him out as I have to angle him just right and sometime hold him awkwardly  in one arm while I manage to get his feet out on the darned seat! Also needs random toys hanging from it as my boy likes to bounce and chew and/or play w/ a toy at the same time.
My son is now 6 mos. old and he absolutely LOVES this jumper. We have a lot of laughs watching him go.  It's so easy to install (note-- you must have moldings on your door frames or the clamp will slide off) -- the only drawback is that adjusting the straps up and down (to accommodate a growing baby) are a little difficult to figure out-- the directions don't help much. I do agree with the comments that this works better in a wide doorway-- we use in a very large passage between our kitchen and living room; I cannot imagine using in a regular door way as my baby likes to swing around too much. Also, this works better when baby is a little older. When he was smaller, we had to wedge a small stuffed toy behind him, and we had to stay next to him because he would start to slide to one side. Now at 6 months, he can hold his own. The biggest drawback? He now loves to jump so much that whenever his feet touch the ground, our lap, etc. he starts to laugh and jump!
This item is SO frustrating.  What would seem to be a very easy toy to put together cost me over an hour of wasted time.  The seat was not made correctly and I could not get it to fit on the frame.  I spent a half hour trying to get it on and then a half hour driving it back to Babies R Us.  I am going to see if the store has another one and put it together before I leave the store!
I have this jumper, just in a different pattern. My son is going to be four months old soon and is VERY tiny. But he is a very active little boy and I knew he needed something fun to do. I didnt want to introduce an exersaucer until about 5 months because its too overstimulating. This jumper is very very nice. I keep his favorite blankets around him and he loves it. He cant bounce too well but he loves the position and if you bounce it for him. It fits in any doorway with a molding over head. It is very very easy to install (took about 25 minutes) and it is very easy to move. Even though it is easy to move, it is very stable. It will not fall and it can withstand even my 2 1/2 year old standing on the seat and "swinging". It is actually very easy to adjust (my friends daughter is 4 1/2 months and a BIG GIRL). My son loves to be in this and it was the perfect solution to my problem. I am also happy that when he does get an exersaucer, we will be able to "rotate" him from jumper to saucer. I cant see anything more you would want in a doorway bouncer, and it is much safer, more comfortable, LESS room, and more fun than the jumparoo!
I really love the idea of a doorway bouncer, so I was thrilled when MIL got us a Johnny JumpUp.  When we put our baby in it at 4 months, though, I realized it does not offer enough support for a small baby.  It has a wide range of adjustability, which is awesome, but my baby just slumped so uncomfortably in the seat, not at all like the happy looking older baby on the box.I bought the Graco Jumpster instead, and loved the way he fit in the seat, loved the way it bounced and twirled, but didn't love the way we already had to set it on the highest setting.  My baby is big - 16lbs, 4oz and 26 1/2 inches at his 4 month check-up - but he's not THAT big!I returned it and instead bought the Jumperoo, which offers better adjustability (like the JJU) PLUS seat support (like the Jumpster).  Everyone raves about the  Jumperoo, and my baby seemed to like it in the store, so I thought it would be a good product.However...The jumping motion is not as smooth as the Jumpster's, nor can the baby spin and twirl as in the Jumpster.While it is "portable," moving it from room to room is no where near as easy as moving the Jumpster.The toys on the tray seemed like a nice idea at first, but they rattle so much as the baby jumps that they are irritating.  Yes, you can remove the toy unit but then what is the point?And it takes up way too much room.  If you are ready to take down your swing, or have unlimited space, this is fine, but we still use our swing for naps and our house is already overrun with baby gear.  (I suspect a lot of people are in the same boat!)So back to the store with the Jumperoo and home again with the Jumpster.I use those linky rings you can buy to attach toys between the straps so my baby has toys to play with that are less rattly than the Jumperoo toys.After buying this item for the second time, my husband discovered that it actually IS possible to shorten the length of the hanging strap considerably without altering the product.  You just have to read the directions more closely than I did at first...  oops.I know a lot of people think doorway jumpers are unsafe, but I really can't imagine this item coming lose from the doorway and hurting my child.  It is easy to move (the JJU is VERY tough to relocate) yet doesn't come open so easily that I can see it happening accidentally.  The components also seem to be connected in such a way that I can't see anything coming lose and allowing my child to fall out of the device.  Other reviewers have complained of this happening; perhaps the item has been improved since then?
this is a great bottle, as long as you don't screw the top on too tight. when i first started using them,i couldn't figue out why it kept leaking. so i took a ride to bru and talked to a person reguarding the leak and she said you can't put the cover on too tight..you have to put the cover on top of the white piece and nipple and screw them on together...but not too tight..after you learn that, it is a great bottle. we have had no problems since. definitely recommend this product....
This set is much better than Avent's last &quot;Newborn Starter Set&quot;.  The old set had 1 pacifier, 2 4oz bottles, 2 9oz bottles, 4 newborn (number 1) nipples and 1 bottle brush.This set has 2 newborn pacifiers, 2 4oz bottles, 3 9oz bottles, 5 newborn (number 1) nipples, and 1 bottle brush.  This set is great when you couple it with the Avent Infant Feeding Set (4 9oz bottles, 1 pacifier, 4 travel nipple bases, 4 sealing disks, and 4 slow flow (number 2) nipples.Avent is really improving the products they offer.
I would never reccommend these bottles to anyone.  I am a nursing Mother and thought these bottles we suppsose to mimic the breast.  They do just the opposite.  There were so many bubbles in the bottle that I could hear them...because of this it caused my 3 week old to become gassy and very cranky.  I soon switched to playtex nursers and she is great with them.  The nipples on the Playtex Nurser are much softer and mimic the breast much more closely than the Avent.  Over all, the Avent bottles are a waste of money!
We have not had a problem with leaking unless we, the users, don't screw the lids on tight.  Our daughter had no problem with the nipples, and we love that they are not latex.  The only things we didn't do by the book, is that our daughter advanced to the next level of nipple about a month before each recommended age.  But that will be individual to each child.  We also love that we can turn these into baby food jars later on.We have now used this set on our second child and we still love them.  This is the same set our first child used and we have not had to replace any bottles, nipples, or pacifiers.  Nothing has broken despite child #1 sometimes launching a bottle across the kitchen.  And this silicone nipples and pacifiers show no signs of wear or breakdown.  As with child #1, child #2 advanced to the #3-nipple a whole lot sooner than Avent's suggested age, but again every child is different.  Just watch your child for cues that she's getting the milk/formula at the speed that's right for them.
Avoid nipple confusion and use avent! My 6 month old baby has been using this since he was only a few days old and there is no problem! I breastfeed, but for the first 5 days when my milk hasn't come in, I used avent. My baby didn't have a problem switching from breast to bottle at all. Even today I give him juice using Avent and my son has no problem switching.But to backtrack to the birth of my son. The hospital bottle fed my son after taking him away from me because I had a c-section. The hospital used those Similac ready made formula that comes in their own bottle. Between that nipple and the Avent nipple my baby became nipple confused. It was a horrible experience getting him used to the Avent nipple, but once he did it was smooth sailing like I mentioned above.Learn from me! If you plan on using Avent, bring some bottles with you to the hospital and instruct the nurses to check with you before bottle feeding your baby. Trasfer the formula to the Avent bottle and you'll avoid nipple confusion!
My baby has developed feeding issues including a unique mixture of colic and reflux that had made feeding times a nightmare for everyone in our house.We started out using the Playtex Drop-ins system and that worked fine for us until we were about 1.5 months old.  Then suddenly there was lots of gas and screaming at feedings.  I switched to the Playtex Vent Aire bottles and the screaming stopped, but there were issues with the nipples and that just wasn't working out for us either.  Baby was spending more calories than she was taking in with level 1, and drowning with level 2.  Plus there were wierd extra parts to clean and keep up with.  It was a temporary answer to our prayers but still not what we were looking for.Because we have a preemie, changing her formula isn't an option because she needs the nutrients in this special formula we are giving her and she is continuing to gain weight.  So the real issue has become trying to make feeding more comfortable for her and us.  As a final resort (I had spent so much on bottle systems that didn't work out that I had almost given up), I gave the Avent feeding system a try.It has worked wonders.  Baby eats in an appropriate amount of time now, there are only the standard parts on any bottle to clean and manage, baby tolerates the nipple and flow well (we use both level 1 and 2 nipples).  Best of all are the special "Variable Flow" nipples, sold separately-we use those for feedings where we have to mix in rice cereal and they allow the cereal through, not too fast but no clogs either.  I like not having to "alter" the flow of the regular nipples with toothpicks, etc. because once you do this, there's no going back.  The Variable Flow nipples solve that problem and leave the other nipples unscathed for normal feeding needs.  Also, our baby was addicted to the Soothie pacifiers at the hospital.  We have tried Nuk, Mam, Gerber and she wouldn't accept any of those.  But she is accepting the Avent pacifiers included with this newborn starter set.My advice to parents looking for bottles to help with/solve feeding issues-buy the smallest number possible and give it 5 days.  If it looks good on day one and is the same kind of good by day 5, it's safe to sink more money into it.  But if it isn't going to work out, it will be obvious by day 5 or sooner that you haven't found "The Answer".  Avent's bottles have passed this test for us and I would highly recommend them.Additionally, if your baby is experiencing colic and or reflux, see fussy baby dot org for tips and ideas.  Also I would recommend a specific brand of gripe water called Colic Ease (all brands are not the same, see their ingredient page to see why).  The fussy baby site and this gripe water teamed up with Avent bottles have really helped us out work through our feeding issues.  Good luck!
While I'm a stubborn Anglophile, I'm very disappointed by Avent's products.  The bottles are not comfortable for people with small hands (or stubby fingers) to hold, and the worst part is with the nipples, which are made of semi-hard plastic and too large for young babies.  I think Dr. Brown's or the Playtex Ventaire is way better.  Even Gerber's one-use disposable nipples are way better.
I have used these bottles since my son was born (he's 6 1/2 mo. now) and I have no complaints.--They don't leak if you assemble them correctly--Make sure you are using the right size nipple (stage 1,2,or 3)--Easy transition between breast and bottle (I did both)--Very versatile (can use as storage when you have sealing discs and as sippie cups when you buy the attachment)--You can put handles on them!!!  If your baby wants to hold the bottle but can't because they are so wide, try handles.
I had to switch to bottles because of low milk production and having to supplement soon after my son was born.  I love the look and feel of avent bottles but my son has a small mouth and was unable to get a good suction on this nipple.  He would leak milk everywhere or squirt it at us, it was very messy.  Therefore I had to switch very quickly to playtex standard bottles.I also don't recommend buying many 4oz bottles, my son drank less than four ounces for only about 6 weeks and he was up to 5 ounces, and it is a pain to have to fix two bottles.
The tiny lip on the nipple does not count as breakthrough technology in preventing the baby from swallowing air. I recommend Dr. Brown's bottles. They cost more, but they're worth it.
I don't know why so many people have had problems with leaking. It must be operator problems because I've never had that problem. I don't notice any excess gas either. We just burp her once and that's all she needs. I breast feed exclusivly so we only use the bottles on occasion but she has no problem switiching. They really do promote breast feeding. We used the Playtex bottles first with the drop ins but they were really hard to warm up. We have the Avent bottle warmer (which is also great) and the bottles are so easy to warm so you're not trying to hurry while your baby screams of hunger. They are simple to clean, no extra parts. I would reccomend them to anyone.
These bottles look so nice and are so durable BUT they only offer one kind of nipple and are not compatible with any other system, so if you child doesn't like thier nipple, you're heavily invested in a huge set that is useless.  And Avent is SO expensive!  Niether of my boys liked these bottles/nipples.  I primarily breastfeed and the shape of these nipples are nothing like mine.  The silicone is the wrong texture too - nothing like the real thing.If you really like the look of Avent and think you want to use them, buy just one bottle and nipple to start until you are sure they work.In my opinion, a much better starter system is the Playtex (I use the Drop-Ins) - it comes with several different nipple shapes to try, including latex, which has a more realistic texture.I foolishly bought the Avent starter set because someone somewhere told me that they were the most breastfeeder friendly and that companies that make bottles AND formula only want to sabatoge your brreastfeeding efforts - - what a silly and paranoid accusation that turned out to be!
I never had any problems with the bottles. I read a review where their baby had bad gas; remember that ALL babies get gas. It could be from what you are feeding your child not from the bottles. Try watching what you eat (if you are breastfeeding/pumping) or try another type of formula. Give the bottles another chance. I love them!
I use Avent bottles and Avent pacifiers, and haven't had any problems with colic or gas. No nipple confusion either.
Although I gave these bottles 5 stars, I have mixed feelings.  One of my twins loves these bottles and has been fine using these since coming home from the hospital (she is the better eater of the two).  My other daughter, who was smaller and didn't love feeding time as much, has never liked them.  I don't know if it's the wide nipple that she doesn't like or the way the formula flows out...  I registered for 2 of the starter sets.  If I had to do it over again, I would have registered for 1 starter set and then a few other kinds of bottles to see which ones the babies preferred.  Also, I had some flow issues with the nipples - some seemed to have no holes at all and although you are supposed to sterilize a pin and poke it through the tip,  those nipples still never worked well and led to very slow feedings.  I also saw on other reviews that some people had problems with leaks - sometimes this would happen but not enough to be a real problem for me.
I found the nipples EXTREMELY hard for a new born baby to suck on.  I used the Playtex bottles w/ the disposable liner and it made my life much easier.  In the playtex starter pack, there are also nipples of different sizes and shapes so your baby can decide whe one she likes.
When my daughter was born 6 years ago I had a close friend who always swore by these bottles.  Anyway I never tried them then but decided to move my colicky 3 month old onto them from Dr Brown's as we are travelling overseas and the Dr Brown's leak as well as having too many pieces to clean making them a hassle to travel with.  We really like them and think that they are great! I like it that they have an intermediate nipple between the newborn slow and fast flow.  They have leaked once but as my husband pointed out, as with any o ring if there isn't some moisture to lubricate it when fitting the two pieces together it will leak.  Also with heating it up without removing the ring it allows for pressure to build up around the o ring and therefore cause leakage that way.  I am happy with them and will continue using them.  We also love the Avent Steam Sterilizer, what bliss! Well worth the $70!
These bottles are the worst I've ever seen.  My son could not get latched on correctly, the nipples were too small, and then when he drank from them it went down way to quickly.  And why should a bottle be so complicated that you have to either hold it just right or screw the lid on just right, not to tight you know.  Who wants to mess with that in the middle of the night.  We switched to the playtex natural latch and everything was much better.  Yes you have  the bags, but there is no leaking and no extra air.  I only use these bottle with my pump and even then they are a pain in the butt, because they don't want to stay screwed to the pump. ERRR!! Very frustrating.
The bottles must be assembled the right way to ensure no leaking.  I think people are experiencing leaks because of failure to read directions...-Pull the nipple through the white collar and make sure that the little ridge is sitting on top of the collar all the way around.-Then put the dome cap onto the white collar.-Take filled bottles and screw the nipple on as one whole assembled unit (white collar, nipple, and clear dome cap)-Twist the dome cap until the white collar locks.  Do not overtighten.  Amazing...no leaks!When all else fails, read the instructions!  All products are made differently.Our son is ready to start with nipple #3, we haven't had any problems so far.  Good luck!
This set really is great. It has 4 9oz bottles, slow flow (number 2) nipples, 4 sealing disks, 4 travel nipple bases, and a newborn pacifier.This, combined with a 3pk of 4oz bottles makes a a great start to infant feeding.  It will also save you some money because you won't need to buy the Breast Milk Storage kit.
I used these through out my daughter's infancy, largely because I bought a whole set of them, the milk storage contraptions, the breast pump, and the pacifiers.  Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn't take any other kind.But the bottles routinely leaked, ruining several diaper bags, clothing, and nighttime feedings.Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM!My daughter didn't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about, but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months.All in All, I think the paci's are great, the rest of it I could do without.
Although they have a good reputation, they definately have a drawback.  They are short and fat bottles, so you really have to lean your baby back to get all the liquid to the nipple.  Now that my son is holding his own bottle, we don't use them for that fact-it's just too hard for him to get his formula to the nipple, he gets too frustrated.  All in all I'd say buy a different bottle.
I think this bottle is  overall the  best out  there. Dr  Brown' s is excellent for colicky  babies but  it leaks horribly. Once  the  bay was no longer  colicky we returned to  this  bottle. My  son enjoys the 4oz one  and has been the  first bottle (we tried 4 different brands) to  hold. We added the handles from the training  sippy  cup when he was 2 months  and 1/2 and he  enjoyed grabbing  them a lot and experiencing self-feeding with our  help. I love that the sealing  disks are excellent and, in general, they  have all the range of accessories one  needs to make the most of this bottle.The nipples are very durable as well.
Yes, these bottles do leak if not put together properly and did cause one of my twins some gas but out of all the bottles I tied (and I tried alot) the flow of the stage 1 nipple suited both my children perfectly. I have twins and my daughter was born at 4lbs (considered preemie)and this is the only bottle that suited her and her brother perferctly in terms of flow, capacity and ease to clean. So the benefits greatly outweighed the few flaws this bottle has. In regard to the gas I found that if I held the bottle at a tilt towards the babies chest it solved the problem. Might not work for you but thats how I deal with it.
I have been using these continuously for over 5 years, and they make a great everyday straw cup that you don't have to worry about losing and having to replace. (For those concerned, these are coded #5 for recycling, and many municipalities don't recycle #5 plastics. Luckily, ours does.)We found that the other Take & Toss style, with the vented spout,The First Years 5 Pack Take And Toss Spill Proof Cups, 10 Ouncehad two problems: (1) It leaked when tipped over (enough to cause carpet stains) and (2) Our daughter got frustrated by how long it took to drink an appreciable amount through those tiny vent holes. They really were the worst of both worlds!The straw-cup style is great, though. I use them myself. My daughter, now 6, still likes them. Most of them have survived years of top-rack dishwashings. The cap snaps on tightly and the straw forms a pretty snug seal with the hole in the cap. The straws are as tough as the cups, but if they do get chewed or mangled, ordinary soda straws work fine in these cups. And-- hurrah! huzzah!-- there are only 3 straightforward parts to the cup: cap, straw, and cup. No fussy little valves to clean.The straw cups come in a 7-ounce or 10-ounce size, and I'd suggest skipping the 7-ounce. The 10-ounce is light enough for a baby to hold, while still containing enough thirst-quenching liquid for older kids.However, I took off one star because these are not good cups for toddlers under 2. Both our kids tended to remove the straw and dump the cup's contents all over the place, until they got old enough that this trick was no longer interesting. They also didn't quite "get" the concept that the straw has to stay fully inserted or it won't work. So, we stuck with Playtex twist-lock straw cups until they were 2.
When my son started drinking liquids, he just didn't understand sippy cups. We tried lots of sippy cups, then I spotted these gems. He figured these out right away. Fast forward 2 years, we are still using some of the original cups. The lids stay on very tight, I've never had one open up unless the lid wasn't snapped on all the way. The straws fit very tightly, so it creates a vacuum, and very little if any spills as long as the cup is assembled properly. He went through a long phase of chewing the straws. I refuse to buy any new cups until the straw chewing phase ends. He seems to have stopped it, and his brother is just starting to drink, so I think we'll invest in some new ones.
Love these cups - we have them in the sippy type and also straw.  Use them at home during meals, snacks & on the go.  I never really toss them out since they last forever!  We have them in the smaller 7oz and the larger 9oz.I know they're marketed as a one-time use, but they're made very well and we've been using the same cups for almost a year now - the only reason why I have to buy more is because my LO likes to chew on the straws or sippy lid, so I have to replace the tops only.  I wish they sold replacement parts!  Easy to wash and care for, and if by chance I need to ditch one while we're out and about, it's not a big deal.  We hand wash our dishes and I use a straw cleaner to clean out the inside of the straws.For the most part, these hardly leak at all.  I've thought about using disposable straws, but we're still trying to teach the LO not to pull the straw out and to hold the cup upright (rather than tilting back like drinking out of a sippy).  Busted these out at my LO's b-day party and my friend loved them and got some for herself!
these dont spill, and i have been using them for 5 mts, not really tossing them :) straws are thick and durable. colors are nice.
Like other viewers I am trying to find cups for my daughter who is graduating past sippy cups. These have a good size to them. I don't feel like I have to constantly refill them. I have ones in the past like these that she used successfully, but much smaller. They don't leak freely upside down unless some liquid stays in straw..
I love the regular take and toss cups, so I was excited when I saw these. I got the boy color four pack for my 2 year old son and at the first usage I realized that these were a bad idea! He can pull the straw out and then the liquid comes out, what is tee point of having a removable straw!? I'm going to try the straw cups with the twisty top instead, don't waste money on these...cheap as they may be!
My twin toddlers love spoons and forks. They aren't agile enough to use them to eat with just yet, but if they get their hands on a fork and remove it from the table, it becomes an instant toy. They hold up in the washer and are safe for little hands and mouths.
Easy learning how to use silverware with these! My nephew is 2 years old and these are easy to buy, and use a few times and throw out
My son likes these because they're shorter than the other spoons we had.  The forks are also spork-like, so he can use them much more easily than a regular fork.  I've washed them a few times and had no problems.
We love these spoons! They are a great toddler size you can actually get a few Cheerios on this spoon unlike the teeny baby spoons, yet small enough to fit a toddler mouth. I rate this product 4 stars because the forks aren't great. They are hard to use to stab and pick up items like eggs and pancakes.
These are wonderful for diaper bag and at home. If you are out somewhere and lose it..no big deal. They are always nice to have in the diaper bag b/c  you never know when your little one is going to need them!
We're not talking about fine silverware here, but for the price they certainly serve the purpose.  I think it is a good buy for the money though.  I only wish they were just a little larger.
All in all I love this bouncer.  So does my son.  We did have some problems in the beginning though.  I got it as a gift and after putting it together, found out the massage feature didn't work.  It took 3 returns to find one where that feature worked.  After getting a working one, I couldn't be happier.  It's great to carry throughout the house so I can get things done.  I do wish it had an optional feature for the music and massage to stay on without shutting off after a set amount of time.  It tends to wake him when it shuts off.  Seems to be safer and more sturdy than most on the market.
My daughter just love it. She can sleep in too!!!OH...Great Price too!!!Absolutely recommend it.
My daughter LOVED this chair! She would sleep in it the first 3 months (it helped keep her upright). She was sleeping 6 hours a night at 6 weeks and 8 hours by 10 weeks. But she would only sleep that long in this chair. It was awesome. After she could sleep through the night in her crib, she would sit in the chair and play with toys or watch tv (gasp). It was just a great chair. On the other hand, I was so excited to have it for my son (#2), but he would not sit still in it at all. So when they sit it in, it's fantastic. When they don't, they don't. Granted, he would not sit in any type of bouncy chair for very long (only the swing for him, which my daughter never used).
This bouncer is so great! We have 4 girls ages 6 and under. There are times when I am so busy that I simply cannot hold our littlest one, Esther. I'll stick Essie in this bouncer, hang some colorful toys from the velcro straps, turn on the vibration and she is good to go! She really enjoys looking up at the toys (I put colorful Sassy toys on because she wasn't that interested in the ones that came with it) and the vibration is very soothing. The angle of the seat is perfect, reclined enough for a newborn but not so far back that older babies make it sink to the floor. While I wouldn't recommend this, it will withstand even a 6 yr. old pretending to play *baby* in it! lol! At any rate, it seems very sturdy because all 4 of my girls have taken it for a spin on more than one occassion. Well built, well designed, comfy and soothing. This is a great product.
My daughter LOVES to nap in this bouncer. In fact, she's sleeping in it right now! Whenever she is fighting sleep I just put her in here and bounce her to sleep. She loves the vibration but the back massager tickles her so she fusses when I put it on. She also loves the music. Everytime I turn it on her eyes get really big and you can tell she's really focusing on the sounds.I do agree with the other people who said that this is not a good bouncer for playing in. The toys that are attached are made of dull colors so I just took them off and put other ones on.
This is a must have for every baby!  So soft, our baby just loves it!
We love this chair.  It is so comfy and cushy and the built-in blanket is great.  The vibrating mechanism works every time to put our little one to sleep at times when she is fussy.  Also it is very easy to fold up practically flat and store out of the way.  I would also like to say that the color scheme of this chair and matching swing is so much more complimentary to a neutral room that you don't even mind leaving it out when company is over.The only suggestion I would offer is to add a detachable toy bar, I would love for my baby to be more stimulated when she sits in the chair during her awake hours.
My little baby girl loves this chair.  It's perfect for the livingroom when my husband and I are sitting and chilling out watching TV.  In the afternoon when I need a few minutes to put her down and start a load of laundry - this chair works out perfect.  I just put on the vibration feature and she wisks off to dream land... or is pleasantly entertained while I am walking around (with child free hands).Being able to put her down every once in a while is wonderful since she seems to have an issue with gas and possible reflux.  This chair works great because it elevates her to a position where she is totally comfortable and able to sleep.  I got this as a registry gift (and added it from a recommendation from a friend), and I am so happy we have it.  We also added the Natures Touch Cradle Swing to our registry.  We have that in the kitchen and the Papasan in the livingroom.Definitely add this to your registry or purchase it yourself for your baby... it's worth the money and freedom your arms get *especially with a fussy baby always needing to be held*.
My baby loved this bouncy seat for about 4 weeks. She isn't into the bouncing anymore. But, it is a comfy seat that she sits in a lot. I use it (off now) for her to sit in when I shower, she will sit content in it for a long while without it even on! Very comfy, the attached blanket is nice and soft. It just cradles her perfectly!!
This is by far one of the nicest LOOKING baby seats out there. I received a barely-used one as a pass-along-gift from my girlfriend. Now I now why it was barely-used. Her son didn't like it. Neither did mine! I didn't get it-- it was warm, soft-- he didn't care and wanted nothing to do with it-- preferred this hideous baby seat every time. The back is very flat- so I never felt like the baby was really "in" a seat, more like leaning on it. This may work for much smaller babies, but at 8 lbs., my baby was done with it by week 3.
This papasan chair has been a great item!!  Since birth, my daughter enjoys it.  At birth, she would fall asleep in it.  At 7 months, she watches TV in it. I can travel with it because it folds up and is light!!!  It is very cozy for her and I wish I had one!!!!!!!
When I saw the Baby Papasan line, I just had to have this for our daughter.  She has a perfectly good Ocean Wonders bouncer that she loves but something told me to get this one and I'm glad I did.She has a few minor breathing problems and sleeps better on her Boppy or in the bouncer or swing.  Well, in her fishy bouncer her head would fall over but not in this one.  This is more of a comfy sit back and relax bouncer.  It is so soft and comfy and she loves to sleep in it.  She naps in it most days.We still have the fishy bouncer and we use it for play, but when she wants to nap she wants her papasan.  I will admit that when she wants to play, she wants out of this so it does have some flaws.
Alot of my friends baby had reflux so I thought my daughter would have. At about 1 1.2 months I would put my baby in this chair in her pack n play (which was in our room). Then at about 2 months I put the chair in her crib to get her used to the crib. Once she started moving I took her out of the chair and she was used to her bed and room. It was great and it made her feel snug and secure. I borrowed my first one from a friend so I'll def. buy one for #2.
My son loves it so much. We have it since he was born and now he's 5 mounths and we are still using it.He slept in it when he was younger (that's the only place he wanted to sleep) now he seats in it to watch everything around.Nice buy !
I had preemies and this was too big for a long long time, but I had them padded, swaddled and pinned the head cushion back and it worked out just fine.Now that they are 9 pounds 22 inches..they're finally fitting into this seat. One LOVES to sleep in it. At first I kept putting her in there as after feeding I was worried about whether she was well burped once I had to get on with her sister, this chair seemed to not only keep it all down but doubles as her cozy nest. The attatched blanket(removeable) it great for tucking them in. The music loop is tiring but def. more soothing than the Kick and play bouncer we have...what a short lived item.We do have to keep it at a tilt with a cushion at the foot because it's too much of a tilt and they slide down quite a bit. They're almost 3months..I know we have much time to go still with this chair.It's really nice fabric and not obnoxious like a lot of other items out there. Soothing for both of us. Thinking about the swing now...it must be as great as this papsan, right?
I already had a full size Graco Swing for my 2 month old but I needed a travel swing to take to Grandmas for frequent visiting. It worked well for the first two weeks and my baby really like the hanging toys but then the batteries died. After finally figuring out to replace them (takes a bit of a trick to get the battery compartment back in its slot)the Duracell batteries died again in another two weeks. Overall the swing is cute and my baby liked it for a while but he only used for 1 month tops and he much prefers the full size swing. Not really worth the extra expense, stick with the full size or another travel model.
My son hates this swing.  He never liked it.  As mentioned from quite a few other people, it is very difficult to remove a baby w/o hitting their head.My son tore a neck muscle when he was delivered and b/c of that he "tips" to one side, and the toys were always hitting him in the head.  It was awful.The swing does move quite quickly, also.  Setting #2 was all I could use for a long time b/c it moved so fast.It may fit some babies, but definatley not mine!
I didn't register for this gift but received it at my shower. I kept it because I thought it would be great for visiting relatives' homes. We used it for the first time over Thanksgiving and we were truly disappointed. Our daughter, Esther, is 3 months old and on the large end of the scale. She is also fairly strong with decent head control  for a baby her age (but far from sitting up). When we put her in this swing we were quite surprised by how bad it was. It doesn't recline at all and she kept slumping to the side. When she slumped to the side one of three things would happen:a) the toys (which don't come off) would whack her in the headb) her head would bang into the frame as it swungc) both.We tried supporting her with blankets and taping the toys out of the way but nothing worked. My 3 older daughters wound up putting their Care Bears in it and using it for a toy. Maybe it will be better when she is older but it stinks right now. I gave it 2 stars only bc she did seem to enjoy the blinking lights. I read the instruction manual cover to cover and had my husband do the same. It does not say anything about how to make it recline further. In fact, you can see by the way the mesh is at the sides of the seat that it is impossible to recline - the angle is fixed. I have already thrown out the box but am going to phone Fisher Price to see if I can return it to them. I think this swing borders on unsafe and I wouldn't feel comfortable putting Essie in it again.
This swing is very useful to have when going places.  My son likes to watch the light show but he can't watch it when he is swinging and also the swing swings a little faster when they are small.
My 4 1/2 month old daughter has enjoyed this swing since she was 1 month old. Early on, she took 2 hour naps in the swing. Now she delights in the lights, toys, and music. I can easily move her from room to room in the swing while I cook or get ready to go somewhere. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the batteries need changing too often. Maybe that is only because we enjoy using it so much?
My Husband and I both fell in love with this swing the first time we saw it and thought it was such a great idea!  I was a nanny for about a year before we had our baby and I also worked with children at a daycare on a part time basis for several years.  The children at the daycare loved the swing and so does my daughter!  Yes, you do have to be careful not to hit their head on the swing, but come on!!!  That isn't all that hard to avoid.  You just can't yank them out in a hurry.  And it is worth the extra trouble for the amount of time that you get free while baby is entertained!  Out daughter is 5 months old and she still sits in it for a long time while i get stuff done.
Our baby is 2 months and she talks and smiles at the orange fish. We have yet to set it above a 2 because even that seems a bit fast for me but she can grow with it. I love that it folds down and can go with us. I wouldnt go back to a full sized swing.
I use these to use with Pura stainless steel baby bottles. Putting the spout in is a tight fit, but it isn't going anywhere once it's in. I've never had one leak. They are very sturdy and made from hard plastic. I've been using them since my son was 11 months old because he destroys silicone spouts. These are indestructable (so far!) and seem like they will last for a long time. I've been using the same two for over six months and they show no sign of wear. You have to be careful not to misplace the small piece that goes under the spout and makes it spill proof, though. It's a small clear circle and would be really easy to lose in the dishwasher.
This works with our AVENT bottles.  It did leak a tiny bit, but what sippy top doesn't.  We had trouble using it with ourPura Stainless Steel bottles.  They will fit, but with quite a bit of coercion.  All other AVENT sprouts/nipples that we used have fit the Pura bottles, so not sure why these are different.
I bought Avent bottles because of their ability to be used as sippy cups. Trying to save myself a little cash and the nuisance of more cups. Alas, my kids just have no interest in these what so ever. Not to mention Avent bottles barely screw together so my kids can way too easily take the tops off. If I could go back I would have bought a different brand of bottle. Ultimately a waste of money.
Works well with our Pura Kiki bottles. Isn't completely leak proof in that if your child sips but doesn't swallow all that they sipped that portion will leak out when cup is turned over. Otherwise it does appear to be virtually leakproof.
If your baby is due in the fall or winter, you must get this.  It is so much easier than trying to wrap them in a blanket and buckle them into the car seat.  It is very easy to get into the car seat and once it's in, you don't need to mess with it again (except to zip your baby up!).  Since you don't have to bundle them up entirely, we used it until the weather got in the mid-60's and just didn't zip it up.
THIS ITEM IS GREAT! I DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO GET THE SNOWSUIT ON MY NEWBORN. I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER ABOUT THIS BEING SAFER THAN A SNOWSUIT BECAUSE U CAN ADJUST THE CARSEAT STRAPS RIGHT TO YOUR BABY WITH NO LOOSE STRAPS LIKE THERE WOULD BE WITH A JACKET OR SNOWSUIT. IT IS SO SOFT AND WARM. THE BUNDLE ME IS BEST! AND THE PINK IS SOOOO CUTE FOR MY BABY GIRL!
I have two of this type item; this exact one and one that has elastic that covers the top.  I read some of the other reviews about this not being safe because of the "compression" factor, but really found it not to be all that thick, so I wonder how much it could really interfere with the harness, since the harness slips through the cover and buckles underneath the top portion.  I love that the top zips off so car rides don't get too warm.  I do wish it was able to cover her heard without just laying it on top of her face though... That's where the elastic slip-ons are better, but with those I found they interfered with the canopy on the carrier...  Otherwise, I think this item is fantastic - pretty color, very soft, easy to install, remove and clean....
This is a great product for fall or winter babies if you live in a cold climate.  It does away with bulky snowsuits which are inconvenient as well as unsafe.  This is easy to use with any infant car seat.  It allows baby to stay warm when needed and unzips easily when he/she does not without disturbing him/her. A must have for any cold weather baby!!!
I love this swing. My friend let me borrow her link a doo swing and my daughter loved it.  She liked to bat at the toys and look at herself in the mirror.  The music was a plus as well.  It lulled her to sleep while we were at my friends house.  I also like that it is portable and has an open top like the jack and jill version.(That one doesn't have music though)  The motor on this swing works great. I put it on the third setting and it swung her just fine. My daughter was almost 18 1/2 lbs at the time. I have also tried the deluxe version but I hated the bar that went across the top.  My husband bumped our daughters head on that a few times. The link a doo is a good portable swing to take from room to room or house to house.(so is the jack and jill version)I am going to buy this for my friends when they have children.
Easy to fold and use.  I take to my son's daycare so that he can use his own swing and I can take it home with us.  It is sturdy and very soft.
It's a great swing...but my daughter scream when I sit her in there.Maybe when she's bigger...(hopefully)
we bought this for our daughter when i became too tired to deal with her nighttime awakenings.  she has reflux and needed to be upright, but didnt sleep well in her infant seat.  she liked to have the movement of the swing, and the take along version was perfect to put in our room, and later, into her crib (with the rails up) to get her used to sleeping in the crib before actually laying ehr down in there.
I received the Graco swingomatic swing for my baby shower, it didn't turn out to be as good as I thought. He hated the swing. I wanted somewhere to be able to put him while I did all my chores and somewhere for him to sit and watch his videos (since he hates his bouncy seat). I went and bought the linkadoos take along swing when my son was about two months. It was very easy to put together. It has a very colorful pattern and two toys that hang from the sides, that my son finds very entertaining. He has little "chats" with the little kitty and doggy toys. It's great that the toys are removable, we take them off and take them places with us. The flower mirror my son really loves too. The music it plays is a little annoying, but it has two volume settings. I love the fact that it has so many different speeds. The padding is simple to take off and washes very nicely. I even put it in the dryer and it looks as good as the day I got it. The only problem is, my son is getting too big for it.My son is now almost six months old. Unfortuately, he does not sleep through the night. He wakes up and will not go back to sleep in his crib. The only place he will go back to sleep is in this swing. It is also the only place he will take a nap. He's a little big for it. I don't know what I will do when he just can't fit in it anymore. I love this swing it has saved my life! We have gotten our moneys worth out of this swing!!
I did not register for this swing. I regisered for the Clarion swing, Spectaor swing and the Fisher Price ocean craddle swing. In addition to those swings. My friend bought me 2 of the Linkadoos take alongs. What a life saver they have been. Right after the twins were born we were in the process of moving into our new home but were not spending nights their till 2 weeks after the babies were born. So the first 2 weeks we spent moving in and getting everything in place. These swings came in so handy. Since we were staying in a small condo we did not have the room for 3 full size swings so when we brought the babies home we used these swings instead. When the twins would come along to the new house we would just fold up the swings and bring them along . Now that we are in our house we still use the swings. I actualy used these swings a lot outside this summer. I also can quick pick them up and carry them downstairs or up stairs. My husband has also taken both of the children down to work with him while hes doing his paper work at the police station and put them in the swings, they love it! With him being a cop sometimes they dont get to see their daddy so he takes any spare mins he can get with them. Its better than just having them sit in their carseats for an hour. We love our other swings also, but they arent as mobile as these are. We have 2 labs in the house and yes we do use caution when our children are in the swings, all of the swings. These swings seem to keep the babies attention longer than the others do. I think its because of the bright colors on the toys. The only reason i gave this 4 stars is because its a little more flimys than the other normal size swings. Yes you do have to use a little extra caution when placing baby in the swing because it is smaller. When the babies were 2 months old we travled to TX and brought the swings along with us. Easy to fly with! We have used these swings for almost 6 months now and they kids still love them!
I received this swing as a shower gift. My son was born weighing about 5.5 pounds so we put a neck supports in the swing he seemed to love it lulled him to sleep and the swing is easy to store. I was ready to give it a 5 star review until today. He is now 6 weeks old and weighs a little over 9 pounds, he can't hold his head up for extended periods of time and he isn't incredible active. He was napping in the swing while I did dishes, I heard him make a little noise so I turned around...much to my horror he was hanging sideways out of the swing! He was buckled in, and I was using one of those head support things. I feel that this is a safety issue, if you have this swing or get this swing please don't ever take your eyes off of your baby, I was in the same room just with my back to him. Luckily my baby was fine I was more shaken up that he was in fact he was still asleep. I have read other reviews and I know other people have had the same problem. ** This is the first and (at this time) the only review I have written
I didnt register for this swing but after not getting a swing at my shower I picked this one up because it wasnt too costly. I absolutely love it though. My house if overcrowded with baby stuff since I have twins and a toddler and teh fact that I can fold this up when not in use is great. One twin hates the music and teh other loves it and I love that I can turn the music on or off depending on who is in the swing. I take it with me whenever I take the kids to grandma's and its easy to carry along and set up.
I was about to buy this one, and found that this item had been recalled back in 2005. Recall: Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seats : [...]
Much safer than the old blue seat or any seat with suction cups! When my daughter was a baby (she is 5 now) I used the 4-in-1 from the first years, it worked alright until it broke (over zellest dad) Then we tried the 4-in-1 from safety first, my daughter who was average size leaned forward to get a toy and fell in to the waterface first with her legs stuck under the ring. Then we tried the blue swivel seat, The whole thing flipped over with her in it and our tub was not textured, all she was doing was kicking her feet. Thank goodness I always held on to her. Now with my son (13 months also averadge size) We have been using this seat for a few months: He has never fallen in to the water and he is more active than she was. I still don't let go of hem for obvious reasons, but this seat is much safer!!
We were looking for something for our son when he out grew his little baby tub and thought this would be great b/c he could sit up. The seat itself is a bit slippery so we had to put something on it first so he wouldn't slide (washcloth will do). He loved that he was able to sit and splash in his new tub seat. However we found it very difficult for just one of us to get him in it. It ended up that both of us would have to be present to get him in the seat. One holds him while the other worked his legs into the seat. It also was hard to wash his privates as he was sitting on his bottom and you can't just lift him to wash it and his front privates were to squashy to get to. We ended up washing his privates on his changing table before puting him in the bath and that was just becoming too ridiculous. We have since bought a mini blow up bath (Babies R' Us or Target) and he loves it and it is easy to wash him and no troubles. However it was much easier to control and felt safer with him being secure in the tub seat....
This seat is not designed to fit over the tracks of the door, therefore it becomes unstable.  The seat does not swivel easily!  You really have to push & pull hard to get it to move at all.  Also-I took mine back because my son kept getting his arm stuck between the seat and the arm that hooks over my tub!  No serious injuries to him, but he did get a bunch of scratches from the sharp seam on that arm. All in all-not a good design at all.  I would say, buy anything else but this.
This seat has made bathing my 5 month old so much more enjoyable.  We had a bath pillow that was fine when he was a newborn but my son hated that thing after he was old enough to support his own head and sit up.  This seat is easy to slide on the side of any standard tub and suctions itself to it so that it doesn't slide around.  There is a release bar that you pull underneth to get it to release when your done.  The seat spins around so that you can get all angles without having to take your baby out and the sides make it easy for him to hold himself up if he starts to lean (he hasn't quite mastered sitting up yet).  The only minor flaw I see it that it makes it a little difficult to wash his "privite areas" so I leave them for last and just take him out of the seat to do it; it's not enough for me to take away any points for this otherwise wonderful seat.
We have two babies- 11 months old and 22 months old.  I'm really surprised to read the other reviews about their babies getting stuck and this not being big enough.  Our 11 month old weighs 25 pounds and our 22 month old weighs 23 lbs. (He's a big baby and she's a petite toddler)  Both children use this during bathtime and I've never had any trouble getting them in or out.This tub is so sturdy and secure.  I love that it attaches to the outside of the tub to keep it from moving around.  A really excellent tub for using once your  baby is sitting up- it allows them to safely play in the tub, splash around, etc. without slipping or sliding.
I like this seat because my eight month old still like to dive sideways into the side of the tub.  The seat is convenient to keep my son safe and he likes to hold the seat and rock back and forth.  The seat fits in the tub just fine.  I like the fact that the seat floats (my Mother told me this while watching my son) if the water is too high.  It keeps you from unsafely filling the tub with too much water.The only drawback is getting my son in and out of the seat.  The space provided for his legs doesn't seem like enough.  I sometimes scrape his legs when putting him in or taking him out of the seat.  He is eight months old which doesn't make it easy to bend his legs to get them through the small leg space.  I am sure this if for safety, but I see it as a drawback because of how uncomfortable my son must feel getting in and out.
My son is 10 months old and we just recieved this item as a gift from a friend. My son weighs 16 lbs and has plenty of room to grow in this seat! He is actually enjoying bath time for the first time!!! he is playing and kicking the water, which he has never done before.. he was always scared of the tub before... I am so glad we got this!!! I love it!! And I feel safer using it than the old types of seats since this one attaches to the side instead of being in the tub where there is a risk of it tipping over.
This is perfect to our little guys. We have two of them in one bathtub with room to spare.Likes:1. Seat swivels (it does not swivel really easily but you don't want it any easier otherwise the baby (at least at my sons age 7 months) will be going in circles while you try to clean them. Believe me, you want it to be alittle hard to swivel around otherwise imagine trying to wash your baby on a merry go round at high speeds.2. It is so rounded and smooth. Our little guys never have marks on them from pulling them out or putting them in.3. The elbow cushion is very adjustable. Our tub gets really wide on the outer ends (about 6 inches) and it fits over it.4. The elbow cushion alone is fantastic5. The option to remove the elbow cushion is nice even though we use it.6. It is small enough to pack on the go for overnight trips.Dislikes:1. No suction cups on the bottom, which makes it hard to pull baby out since the seat goes up with him.
the shower is extremely weak and the water flow is so slow that i stopped using it few minutes after the first time i tried this product.  the tub is small to begin with and having the shower pump/spray inside the tub all the more makes it small.  my 2.5 month-old's legs ended up either banging the shower contraption or simply hanging out of the tub!  worst tub ever, not worth it...  i bought the Eurobath instead (by Primo) which, on the contrary, is the best tub ever!
I bought this tub for my friend and she said it was a terrible product.  The sling was poorly made and the sprayer broke after 5 uses.  She told me she should have listened to me and just used the kitchen sink w/ the sprayer. At least that doesn't break.
I found that when the shower motor stops just open t and blow in the end where it sucks in the water. For some reason sometimes I have to do that and it has never failed. It starts working again.
I echo all of the problems pointed out by the negative reviews: the shower sprayer has never worked, and the tub is too short with the sprayer unit in place in the tub.  I'd add that the plug leaks, which is more than an inconvenience.  Also, the hammock has torn, even though our baby is well within the weight limit.  Overall, I'd say this is one of the most disappointing products we have purchased since the birth of our two month old baby.  Don't waste your money!
We loved this tub for my daughter, it is now called a toddler bath and shower center,  not sure what it was when I got this as a shower gift, but it was a different name.  We used this tub for our daughter from birth until about 16 months when we finally transitioned to the big tub.  It was great for all stages.  The shower thing was a big hit, but it didn't last for long.  It was a pain changing the batteries but we were successful, and then shortly after, while using it we heard a funny noise and it stopped working, we tryed new batteries, but that didn't work.  We continued to use the tub on the counter near our sink so we could use our kitchen sink sprayer on low and that worked just as well.  We eventually put the tub in our big tub and purchased a shower head that we could use the same way.  We loved this tub and found that when she was a new born/infant the positioning of the sling was great and worked well.  I highly recommend, I notice there is another one very similar called the 4-in-1 tub without the shower, that maybe the way to go and not waste on a shower that will break soon anyway.
I love the tub and sling but I find the shower attachment to be a huge waste of time. The water doesn't come out in too good of a stream and the container takes up too much room in the tub. The button that you have to press for the shower should be on the side, it would be easier to use. I have found that a little plastic cup works much better to rinse baby off with. That being said I wish I had just paid a little less and got the model without the shower.
So far this isn't useful to me.  I went out and bought a sponge thing for my son to sit on.  He is 2 1/2 months old right now and when we first used it he didn't like it because he wasn't in the water.  You fill the tub up and they still sit out of the water.  Also, do not let the hose hang down when getting the water prepared because you will come back to it and find a big wet puddle on your floor.  For some reason it leaks out of the spary part.  But so far this hasn't been useful but the bath does seem like a good idea.  So we will see how it works for us in the future.
The sling is too small for my my 12 weeks old daughter. It's hard to hold her steady in the tub because it is too slippery. The spray is useless. it's like it is tangling my fingers when i press to spray, too difficult to hold, should've made it bigger.i think i will return this item because i can't really give her a bath in this tub.
I did not like this  this tub.  It is very small and the sling is awkward and does not hold the baby securely enough.  I never even tried the shower because I switched to another tub which I am very happy with.
Even with the mixed reviews of this item, I put it on my baby registry.  Granted, at the time... I was not completely certain how much use I would get out of it.  Well now that my son is 4 months old, let me tell you... I use this item EVERY day (and sometimes multiple times a day)!  Let me explain why I think this simple piece of plastic is worth the $13... even if you have a dishwasher and even if you use Avent bottles (or Platex, or Second Nature, etc.):1.  It is simple to use.  Wash bottles (or if you are like me and are expressing breastmilk too... then wash all your pump paraphernalia) and put them in unit... add some water... put in microwave and "cook" for 5 minutes... let stand (to steam) for an extra 2 minutes... remove items and sit them on rack to dry.  That is it... very simple.2.  I personally think this is a cleaner way to go than the dishwasher.  Why?  Well, if your dishwasher is like mine then you often find food particles still caught on dishes or utensils.  Hardly a sterile environment... even after going through the heated dry cycle.  I may be super cautious with my bottles and breastpump equipment, but I'd rather wash them by hand and then sterilze them cleanly using steam.(Side note:  for the reviewer who thought she didn't have to CLEAN her bottles before using this sterilizer... honey, please... use some common sense!  YES, you need to wash the bottles to get the milk film out.  This unit is used to kill bacteria, etc on your baby's bottles by way of steam.  It is not a dishwasher itself.  [rolls eyes in disbelief])3.  Who wants to have to run the dishwasher every time a bottle or PACIFIER needs to be sterilized!  This unit uses less energy than running the dishwasher all the time (ahem... that means our utility bills don't become any more outrageous than they already are!).4.  When it came to bottles, my son was quite the product tester.  We started with Platex Nursers of both 4oz and 8oz size... then tried Avent 6oz... after that didn't work... we tried Second Nature 4oz and 9oz bottles.  (My son is breastfed and as it turned out prefered the nipple style of the Second Nature bottles -- more like nursing.)  Anyway, the point is... I have SUCCESSFULLY sterilized all these bottle types within this unit.  Yes, sometimes you have to be clever at packing them in... and sometimes you have to use the unit twice if you just washed a bunch of bottles... BUT it can be done!  While it is true that the lid doesn't lock down, realize that it doesn't need to do so!  The engineering here is simple... you boil the water in the unit using microwave *heat*... and then the items in the unit get steam cleaned for a couple of minutes because the lid traps the steam in.  All the lid needs to do is keep most of the steam inside the unit.  And in my experience, the lid does this without being tightly locked down.  (If there is a caution here, it is:  use a towel when lifting off the lid as the lid gets hot and the steam sometimes billows out.  Ouch!)5.  The plastic spindles do rotate around... so you can fit some pretty unusually shaped items in this unit.  (Did I mention all those pesky breastpump parts I have to wash! [wink])Anyway, I hope this helps people.  I would be lost without this sterilizer.  In fact, I am buying another one for my daycare provider to use because I feel that strongly about this unit's functionality!:)
bought this product for our vacation and i'm very pleased with it.  it can hold 4 Avent 9 oz bottles, caps and nipples OR 5 Evenflo straight (i.e., not the Comfi type) 9 oz bottles/caps/nipples at one time.  so it takes me 2 two sterilizations each day--not bad even when we were on vacation, given you only need 7 minutes each time.  the only advice is you need to put in the nipples on the lower hook/racks before putting the bottles to maximize the space and fit the most number of bottles possible (caps come in last).  the hooks are also movable making it a breeze to fit everything in.  the only watchout--might be big for small microwave ovens.  in the hotel we stayed in, i had to remove the glass tray of the microwave to fit this sterilizer (and give it a little nudge to slide into and out of the oven).  overall, this product's great!
I use the Dr. Brown bottles and this product gets used every day!  I only use it to steralize the bottles, but it's such a life saver.  I don't like putting the idea of using the dishwasher because food particals still get stuck to dishes and I don't see that as steralizing.  I have used this product since the day I came home with my daughter and it's such a time saver.  Just a little water and 5 minutes in the microwave and your bottles are steralized.  I just throw the nipples and rest of the pieces to the Dr. Brown bottles in a pot of water on the stove and boil them.  It doesn't take but 10 minutes of my time every day to do it and the microwave steralizer saves my time.  GOTTA HAVE IT!
I am a brand new mom-to-be, and I registered for this item at the suggestion of veteran moms who had to rely on boiling and other "old" methods to sterilize.  I am very happy with this item.  As a bottle-feeding mommy, I have a lot of bottles to prepare for use in the very near future.  To add to this, I am using Dr. Brown's bottles which, as any Dr. B. user knows, have several parts to clean.  I've just finished preparing all my bottles for my soon-to-be bundle of joy, and this sterilizer was terrific. However, I found that the standard 8 oz. Dr. B. bottle is too tall, and keeps the lid from closing completely on the steamer. No worry, though, this is easily solved if you remove the rack and lay the bottles on their side.  This way I sterilized as many as five bottles at a time.  It takes 5-8 minutes, and you don't have to stand there holding one bottle at a time in boiling water.  You can fit many parts, nipples and pacifiers in at once.  I took care of 19 bottles, all parts and several binkies in less than an hour. I only took away one star because I had to adapt the process for the tall bottles.  I reommend this item.  It made getting all those new bottles ready much easier!
The sterilizer was given to me as a shower gift.  I used it for a few days until I realized it was so much easier to use my dishwasher.  My dishwasher can wash / hold more bottles than the sterilizer.  You have to be careful when removing it from the microwave, it's extremely hot and can cause serious burns.  For those with a dishwasher, stick with the dishwasher.  However, if you don't have a dishwasher, this is pretty nifty for the price.
This was a breeze for my hubby to install.  My toddler loves peering at us while we are in the kitchen through the clear window.  It is also easy to wipe down.  Best yet, it is tough- it has survived hundreds/thousands of openings and a 7 year old jumping over it and banging into it at least 20 times.  I'm getting another one for another doorway.
Everything about this gate is good. It fits, it's adjustable, easy to install, easy to use, and my baby can see me in the kitchen through it. I wish it came in a taller size cause my dog hops over it. That's expected though since she's a fence jumper.
I've set up five different gates in the last month, trying different models in different locations.  This one is the best I've tried.  There are latches on the side to adjust the width which are snug yet reasonably easy to operate.  In compression mode it feels solid, and is not too awkward to set up.  Some gates require so much tension that you have to work to force it into the opening before even engaging the lock.  This one has enough travel in the lock mechanism that you can position it one handed with ease.  It gets even better when it is screwed to the wall.  The operation is smooth and easy.  My one complaint would be that the thumb latch to operate the handle is a smooth plastic that is very hard to operate with wet, even damp, fingers - making it a bit tough right by the kitchen.  Overall though, a great gate.  There are not many which hinge at the very edge, thus giving you a full with useable doorway, and this is the best I've found.  Those others that have a narrow gate opening within a doorway width fence are pretty ridiculous, IMAO.
Item arrived fast and in perfect condition.  This gate is perfect for the top of our stairs.  We purchased this gate in 2006 for our second baby, but we did not keep it.  So when baby #3 came along, I purchased another gate.  The gate is screwed into our bannister on one side.  The other side is our wall which has molding at the bottom, so we had to put up a 2x4 so the gate would be secure.  I think my husband used longer screws than what came with the gate.
After watching my one-year-old tumble down the entire staircase (no real injury, thank God!), I've decided the design flaws in this gate are severe enough to note in an online review.First, I must note that the hardware-mounted gate was open when the fall occurred.  But, since she is capable of climbing down the stairs safely, this is not unusual. We retain the gate to block off the upstairs / downstairs when needed, not purely for safety any longer.What happened, though, is that she stood up and pushed against the gate which swung Through its catch, out over the stairway.  Unsurprisingly she overbalanced and went with it.This is my analysis of the design flaws:1) The mounted catches - little cup-shaped socket dohickeys designed to mate with the rubber-tipped and adjustable pressure extensions on the gate - are designed to be "sort of" one way.  That is, you mount them such that the lip is a little lower on the side where you want the gate to swing, and a little higher on the side where you don't.  Solution: In my opinion, they should be designed to be far more one-directional, which a much higher lip on the "no-swing" side.  Any potential benefit of a dual-swing gate is more than offset by the safety problem introduced.  I cannot think of scenarios in which you'd want to both hardware mount the thing and really need it to swing both ways anyway.2) The exact fit of the gate is adjustable both by macro adjustments to the sliding panels, and micro adjustments to the aforementioned rubber extensions at the top and bottom.  These guys are finger-adjusted by a screw-rod, which my eldest had learned how to mess with rather before his first birthday.  In other words, they're frequently out of whack and must be fixed by an adult before the gate will latch at all.  When too much slack is allowed, the swing-through problem occurs as described above - but it isn't intensely obvious it will happen, because that narrow little lip on the socket Usually catches the thing. Solution: Redesign adjustment mechanism to be more child-proof.  These shouldn't have to be re-adjusted with any frequency, and again the safety flaw introduced outweighs any reduction in convenience.On top of the two more serious flaws, we did have a lot of trouble with installation when it went up 18 months ago.  As others have mentioned, it came with a drilling template that should have made it a snap.  And it would have, if it had been more accurate! I had to drill multiple holes, in other words.Secondly, others have also mentioned that it comes with little spacers to help you work around baseboards.  Indeed it does, but for my home (a 8 or 10 year old tract-built box in the 'burbs) the spacers were completely inadequate.  My baseboards were too wide, and I ended up having to appeal to my father for custom ones made from wood.  Frankly, having the top and bottom tension rods at different extensions to compensate for the baseboard width is a real pain - it's always been a bit crooked and out of true, and usually either top or bottom is maladjusted and will swing through.  I'm not sure what the manufacturer can do about this - houses are different, of course! - but moving the bottom socket and extension up about 2 inches would be a major help.  I don't think you'd have to move it nearly high enough to present a fall-under risk - not one that isn't already there by the fact the silly tension rods extend something like 3-4 inches!So, overall, we're not looking to replace this gate now that it's purchased and in place and both kids are walking.  But I am almost wishing we'd spent just a little more on a better model that addresses the above issues.  Assuming one exists, of course!
Have really like this gate.  We did have some trouble mounting it, but only because (apparently) our walls aren't the same distance apart at the bottom and top of the gate.  Only negative part on the design is that my two do find it fun to bang on the plexiglass window.
We did a lot of research looking for gates.  After comparing many, we decided to go with this one.  After using it for a few months, we love it.  We have it at the top of the stairs, and it is stable, and very easy to use.  One part that we love is that it can be removed very quickly and easily, so if we want it out of the way we can quickly do that.
We have two of these gates and have been using them for almost 2.5 years. We bought these when our LO was about 4 months old and have been using them ever since. We've never had any problems. We've used them both pressure mounted and installed as a swinging gate. Both ways have worked fabulously.They don't go on mouldings really well so we just kept the gate lifted up over the mouldings. That actually worked out well for us because our cats can go under the gate to get where they need to go, but LO is too big to go under. And since that makes the gate even higher, she is still too short to climb over.The plastic is see through but sturdy. So you and LO can see each other through it. When I am cooking I can play peek a boo or other games, and see LO clearly. Her favorite thing is to smoosh her face to the plastic and make silly faces at me. I keep the plastic clean the same way I clean my mirrors, with a glass cleaner and newspaper or coffee filters. We haven't had any issues with discoloration or streaking. She has banged on the plastic and even kicked it while having a tantrum and the plastic is still strong. It doesn't even have dents in it. When they are clean they still look brand new after 2.5 years.The gates are pretty tall, and the latch would definitely be waaay too hard for a toddler to use. I could see a 7-8 year old opening it, but probably not a younger kid. However, a 4-6 year old would probably be smart enough to grab a stool or chair and stand on it in order to get over the gate. I am 5'3 and I can easily step over it without needing to move it when its pressure mounted. LO can grab it and try to pull with all her weight and she can't budge it. I can lean against it and it won't move. These things are really, really stuck in place when installed correctly.They are pretty long. On its shortest setting it fits an average doorway. When its mounted to swing back and forth its got a bit more length due to the mounts. I really love it and I recommend them to my pregnant friends. When people come over they always ask me where I got my baby gates.
I needed a gate that would effectively keep my toddler out, but allow free access for my cats.  I had purchased one that had a cat door built in but it didn't allow for swinging, and stepping over it became a hassle.  So I got this, installed it four inches from the floor, and it's perfect!  I have a pretty chubby cat but she can fit through the gap with ease.  My son likes it because he can see us through the screen, we like it because it is effective, easy to use, and allows for swinging both ways.  It was pretty easy to install - took about fifteen minutes.  Highly recommended!
This gate has been great for the doorway to a room that we are in and out of constantly. I initially purchased theSummer Infant Sure and Secure Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White, but I had trouble with the latch staying closed, not something you want with an ambitious baby around! Sure, it is more difficult to step over this gate, but it will never come 'unlocked' to allow a child to break loose. It is easy to take down anytime you need with one hand, easy to carry around,  and the plastic does not mar the door frame or paint on the wall I lean it against for storage when not in use. The gate can be left on the door frame when the door is closed.For us, the Summer Infant door will not close with the gate up (lever handle, not a knob on the door), so for naptime and bedtime, the gate had to be taken off. This involves unscrewing all four pressure-mount posts, using two hands to carry the gate (one on the door part, one on the frame) and finding a place to put it where the metal would not damage walls or furniture. I think it would be more appropriate for a place where removal was not often necessary. And the noise! A baby grabbing the bars and shaking can make quite a racket!
Easy to put up. Interrupts small creatures and urchins migratory patterns. Does what it is supposed to do quite well (even in the presence of major league baseboards).
We were looking for something that easily opens and this has been working great. I think it's a good price and serves it's purpose for us.
we brought it for the space between kitchen and dinning room.  We didn't want to drill any holes therefore we choose this.  It clearly said &#34;Can be hardware or pressure mounted&#34;.  Yes they are correct if you are NOT planning on using the door function to this gate.  If you plan on opening the door part it will release pressure of the side of the gate.  Therefore you need to remount the gate.  I'm not 6 feet but only a petite person and it will be hard if I just climb across.Bottom line, it's misleading when they said it can be pressure mounted!  please note if you are using the door it will release the pressure mount side.
This is an excellent gate.  We needed a gate that did not rely strictly on tension mounts.  The hardware mounting option is easy, but the instructions are a little difficult to follow.It boils down to this: You need to extend the gate to the correct length by popping the tabs the lock its position into place.  These are painful to unpop, but after one or two tries, you'll get the hang of it.  After that, use the included paper template for where you need to drill holes.  Drill the holes 2 inches deep (you must go two inches or screwing in the screws will be hard to do even if you use your drill to screw them in).  Pop the gate onto the hinges that you mount after drilling, drill/screw in the mounts on the opposing side, and you are done.  Its really much less complicated than the multi-lingual directions lead you to believe.This has become our new favorite gate.  Once you get over the fear or dislike of drilling into your banisters/handrails, it really does become the most functional, easy to secure gate you can buy in my opinion.We tried the metal tension mounted gates and they always seem to lose their grip and need to be re-adjusted all the time.  They also place alot of stress on your railings and if your railings flex at all, maintaining the tension mount will be difficult.  That is the major reason we chose this gate.  Additionally, this gate swings open, giving you 100% of the width of your walkway to walk through, whereas most tension mount gates have a smaller opening to walk through after you mount the gate.This is the best gate we have used!
We have only had this gate installed about a week, but we are quite pleased with it.  The gate we used prior to this was a metal gate, hard mounted with bars.  We specifically looked for a gate w/o bars because a time or two our duaghter, who was learning to stand and pull herself up, fell and her arms went through the bars and were a little stuck.  With this gate, she walks over to it and looks through the clear gate, but can't get through.We did hard mount the gate - which we like and went well with one exception.  The kit provides extension pieces for the top mount, but not the bottom and that is where we felt like we needed it.  Also, we did use the "optional" pieces to hold the other side in place.  We can't really imagine that it would work well w/o it.  Note that even with the hard mount, it still uses pressure to seal the lock.  It's just that you can use it to swing open and close with the hard mount.The way you open and close the gate with the top piece is not difficult for an adult (like some of the foot opening ones), but a toddler couldn't figure it out.We currently use this for a door way, but it will more than expand to fit our stairway as well.  Now that we have tested it out, we plan on ordering another one for other places in our home.
I tried nice looking wooden gates but they were a pain in the rear to open and close and in the end even though this was not my first choice because it wasn't the look I wanted it ended up being my favorite by far. This gate was installed at the top of our stairs when my youngest son became mobile. It was easy to install and I love that with the mounting brackets the gate does not swing out over the stairs. It's easy to open and close with one hand while holding the baby or anything else. After having it for 5 years it's a little scratched up but it still works just as well as the day we got it. I LOVE that it is so easy to remove the gate and leave the hardware in place, takes seconds to remove the gate or put it back in place! Even thought our son is now 5 we still have the hardware installed because it never gets in our way and it makes it so easy to grab the gate out of the basement and set it up when our friends with little ones are coming to visit so they don't have to hoover over their tots the entire time they're hear because we have a split level house and our main floor is upstairs with the top of the stairs in the middle of everything. We're expected another baby in 3 months and I'm so glad we still have this and if we didn't I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.
We love this versatile gate. We needed something that would fit a little bit smaller doorway, and this one is perfect! We love that it can be permanently installed or just on an as needed basis. We have used it both ways and have been very pleased with the results. It is simple to operate one handed as long as you know what you are doing, sometimes we need to help guests figure it out. But that means children will not be able to operate it! The clear plastic window makes it less of an eye sore and my son could peek through from one side or the other and stay safe from the stairs.
I have two of these gates installed in our home; one at the top and one at the bottom of a staircase. I have four children (3 boys and one girl) so the gates get a lot of use not to mention my 14 month old pushing and pulling on it. The gates do not budge, are easy to open and close (but not for baby!) and very easy to clean.
I installed the gate myself and it is mounted to the wall. I purchased two the gates and they did not fix b/c of our baseboard. I am planning to purchase other one to put upstairs. I would suggest mounting the gate to the wall it is more secure than the pressure mount. I installed it myself without my husband:). It is easy to open with one hand. It is located at the top of our stairs that go down to the basement.
This gate was fabulous when my child was under the age of 2, but now my toddler can push it down.  It's pressure mounted, so even if I have it up as tight as can be, it can still be pushed down.
I love this gate, we bought it as a second gate to have on the inside of my son's bedroom door so we could stop playing the opening/closing of the door game.  He can't rip it down as opposed to the cheaper pressure gates I have tried.  It's tall enough that he can't climb over (he's 34"), and latches/unlatches with ease.  I haven't tried the hardware mount so I can only comment on the pressure mount, and it's great!
We bought this gate, primarily, to keep the dog and cats out of the baby room.  My husband mounted this to the door frame and adjusted the gate to fit the door, no problem.  It works wonderfully.  The dog can sit outside the room and see in and that cats want nothing to do with it.  The door is secure and safe.  I don't have to worry about our little one climbing it because there are no foot holds, just clear plastic.  It opens easily and closes in such a way that is easy for my husband and me but I know that our daughter won't be able to work it open.
We have two of these gates for high traffic areas inside our house, haven't found another gate that is easy enough for grown ups to open.  We have grandparents in and out that can't climb over gates and this has eliminated their complaining.  We have a six year old nephew who can open it, but our two and a half year old isn't anywhere close to figuring it out.The clear plastic part WILL get smudged up easily by little hands, but it wipes clean easily enough.  If you're wanting stuff to look pristine all of the time with toddlers running around, well, good luck.  Our's is usually smudged up again an hour after we've wiped it down.  But on a positive note, it makes a great surface for drawing on with washable crayon.Easy enough to assemble, my only complaint is not much of a complaint; after a long enough time of opening and closing it all day every day, it sometimes loosens up enough that you need to get down and readjust it.  However it's not difficult to do that.
I have several different types of baby gates and this is by far my favorite (even though it's not the most expensive). It's the most easily adjustable and it actually stays in place. Winning!
We purchased one of these a few months back. We love the see through panel. The gate itself works better if hardware mounted.
I love this booster!  I didn't think I would like it because it just looked like a junky plastic booster to me from the pictures.  But, after reading the rave reviews I ended up getting one.  BEST decision ever.I really like how adjustable it is.  I use all 3 different tray settings because sometimes I want the tray right next to his belly to prevent food from falling all over his lap.  Sometimes I just want him to be contained and I leave him more space to wiggle.  I haven't had to use the height adjustment because his legs aren't long enough worry about just yet.It folds up into a convenient square for traveling and I keep it in my car.  The tray is much more convenient than using the high chairs they have in most restaurants.  And I just throw the tray in the dishwasher when it gets dirty.The only con I see right now is that the straps are getting rather dirty.  I don't see a convenient way to take them off without undoing the buckles completely from the straps.  Other than that-I love everything about this little chair!
I love this chair it is really easy to clean. I don't use the removable tray liner. My daughter is 1 and really tall and this still works for her. I put another one on my registry for when my son is born.
Wanted toddler child to eat at dining room table with family, but the decorative downward lip around the table wouldn't allow his current high chair to completely pull up to table (with child's legs beneath the decorative lip). This seat has multiple height settings, and the lowest one is flat with the base bottom. This low setting allows child to get legs under decorative lip on table.An excellent choice if getting child to sit at table.We haven't used the tray (purchase was for child to sit at table without needing tray) but seems sturdy and similar to our previous FP high chair tray.
My son is 20 lbs at 6 months and he fits into this really well. I know some other parents said that their kids were too big for it. I'm not so sure he'll fit up to the max weight, but hopefully he can use this for at least the next year.I really like this booster seat. I'm feeling like we wasted our money buying a regular size one that just crowds up our small kitchen. It attaches and adjusts quickly. It's easy to clean, there's no cervices that trap food.  The tray cover is great for keeping nosey cats out of unfinished food.
This seat is useful that we have one in every car we own and at the grandparents.  Here are reasons why:- high utility - used at restaurants on all types of chairs and can be used at home (saves money on cost of a high chair, not to mention the physical space saved from using a high chair).  One of the straps are extra long that also doubles a shoulder carrying strap.- adjustability - these can be height adjusted as well as the tray has three different settings- cleanliness/sanitary - this is better than sitting on a restaurant's high chair (which may or may no t be clean)
We have a small house and a small dining area. I didn't want a huge chair taking up so much space. This straps on perfectly and can tuck in right under the table. The price is also a huge plus! We actually got another that we keep in the car to use at friends and family's houses and restaurants.  Love it.
This is a great booster seat!  It's so easy to clean and and to take with you.  Smaller babies and bigger kids can use this and it's so compact!!  5 stars.
Im really glad I bought this product. The color is EXACTLY what is shows in the picture. NO SURPRISES here. The straps are long enough for any size chair (I think) that was one of my biggest concern, but they fit securely. The tray tables snap on tightly and come off so they are easy to clean. This is the perfect chair when you want to FINALLY get rid of that bulky infant highchair! My kitchen is finally looking back to normal =)
love this booster seat!!  I tell everyone to get it.  I bring it to my parents, friends houses, and every restaurant!  My one year old fits perfectly into it and I've already used it for months.  I don't like how in public high chairs he moves all around.  I just wish there were four hands attached to it to catch all the food!
I love everything about this booster seat! We've never owned a high chair -- this booster seat meets all our needs and takes up no extra space in our house. Our son started using it at 7 months old and this is the only seat we will need to buy. It will easily transition into a toddler booster chair. My favorite things about it:-It's easy to clean -- there are no nooks and crannies for food to get stuck in.-It's not ugly and blends in with our decor -- it's not the first thing that you see when you walk in the room. So much baby stuff is garishly colored. This is a nice shade of brick red.-The main tray is easy to install and remove and fits in the dishwasher. I don't use the removable white tray because my toddler can pull it off. I don't miss it -- it was just an extra piece to clean.-This booster seat is very compact. The base can adjust up so the child can sit comfortably at the table if desired. It only takes a second to remove the booster seat from the chair if someone bigger needs to sit.-The price is SO low! I paid around $20. This is easily the best piece of baby gear for the money that we've ever purchased.
This thing is great!  We used it at home instead of a high chair, took it with us to friends' houses when we went over for dinner, and have now pulled it back out for the 4 year old because he can't stay in his seat at dinner time.
For a few dollar difference, get the deluxe version.  I like the lid to the tray.  It keeps the tray clean in between uses.  The other feature the deluxe version has is the height adjustable seat.  It has 3 heights.  I like to use the tallest so my 9 month old sits closer to me.  We keep it in the car and use it at restaurants and when visiting relatives.At 9 month my kid likes to watch us eat and we feed him little bits of our food when we eat out to keep him entertained.  He likes the seat.  It let's us eat in relative peace.I also have a high chair cover but I prefer to use our own booster chair because it's more clean and the tray is useful to put his cheerios on which he can eat himself.  He isn't old enough to reach for food on the regular table from a high chair so the booster is more useful for now.  Once he is older I think restaurant high chairs will be fine.
My 6 month old is a cranky eater (we cant feed her fast enough) so we didn't think much of her crying tonight at supper, though she was crying harder than usual. When we started to remove the lap tray we noticed she had jammed two of her fingers between the tray and the washable insert - they were swollen and I could tell she had lost feeling in them, she also had serious indentations in her fingers that were already turning blue. She was hysterical when I got her out, presumably because the feeling started coming back in her fingers.  I felt AWFUL. This happened because the insert only secures to the tray in one spot and she happened to wedge her fingers in right by that spot. If it secured in more than one place, this wouldn't have happened.I will simply toss the insert to remedy the problem but I don't want any other Little's to go through this!
We needed to move my 2 year old to a booster because she kept trying to tip over her high chair.  She has chunky legs (30 lbs), so I wasn't sure how well she'd fit in this seat.  Turns out it was a perfect fit for her and she has plenty of room to grow.  We were already using her high chair at the table (with the tray off) for meals, but putting her in this booster seat in an actual dining room chair makes her seem so much older and she really loves it.  Glad to be rid of the bulky high chair... until the next child  :)My mom also has this same booster (in an older model) and has used it for many, many years for all of her grandchildren.  It has held up very well, which is why I knew this would be a great purchase.  I love the back rest and the tray with cover is an awesome feature.
Got this to keep at grandma's house!  It's perfect.  Very secure, very well made.  It straps to most any chair because the straps are adjustable.  It is all plastic and very easy to keep clean.  Great booster seat.
This booster is great! We've used it through three kids. This is one of the single best purchases we've made for our kids. It's great! We use it as a highchair at home, and can easily take it with us to restaurants or over to Grandma's and Grandpa's. It would be nice if it came with more than 1 white tray (one to use, one in the wash), but other than that we absolutely love it, and highly recommend it to everyone we know with babies on the way. So much more economical and more convenient than a highchair!
This booster seat works great.  The straps for holding in your child are a little long, I'd imagine your child would grow out of it before you'd need all that slack, and the extra length gets caught under the tray and makes the tray difficult to secure and remove.  The inner tray doesn't lock in well enough for us, it's become my son's favorite game to pull it out and toss it on the floor.  Still, the tray is small enough so that washing it isn't a hassle, and the whole thing does travel easily.
This straps onto any chair - folds up easy - easy to clean mostly (sometimes those straps need some extra scrubbing!) - easy for transport - not too big and bulky! I would never even purchase a high chair after having this and I'm using it on my second child too! Great that it can be dishwashered :) too!
I really like this chair for when we have little friends over.  The straps easily adjust to fit our dining chairs.  The back is the right height to support little backs.  I like the detachable tray so that a child can either eat from the tray or we can take the tray off and they can be pushed up to the table with the adults.  It's light and folds up for easy storage.  Exactly what I was looking for.
When we bought this seat the first one that arrived was defective. The notch that held the seat back in the upright position was not cut/formed properly. I called Fisher-Price and they sent out a new one right away. They didn't even make me send back the old one. What great customer service and a price that can't be matched. The quality is good and it is easy to clean. The only thing I would change about it is that I wish they had coated the straps in plastic/rubber so they could be wiped down easier.
Works exactly as expected. Baby is comfy while he eats, plastic is easy to clean after. Dishwasher safe tray.Adjustable height. Should work for a long time as its up to 50lbs. Great product. I would never buy one of the bulky high chairs, this is perfect. Small and portable. We take it out to go to parties with us and to the restaurants too. Must have.
DON'T BUY THE BULKY HIGH CHAIR!! This is a PERFECT ALTERNATIVE!!!Just started feeding my baby solids. She was 4 months and 3 weeks old. I read some reviews, looked at the pictures submited and saw some 5 month old babies in this booster. So I tried it and it is GREAT!!! Oh, I'm so happy I don't need to buy that HUMANGOUS expensive high chair. You can also carry his booster anywhere around the house. I put it on top of the dining table someties(in the middle). Baby is not that big yet and can't flip it. Easy to clean. GET IT!
Just what I needed. Works well so far will be updating if I have any trouble. Overall loving this product so far and would recommend.
I love this booster! We only used a highchair for a short time and our little one wanted to be at the table. This was a great choice and we actually bought a second one in another color. It is so easy to clean or take with you to family or friends house. It definitely simplified things for us so we didnt worry about her mess or finding a place she would be able to eat. Its inexpensive and functional.I bought mine from diapers.com and was very happy. If you use the code BAIL2798 you can get 20% off your whole purchase from all their sites.

We find this very useful when we are traveling or visiting family that doesn't have children.  Small enough to keep in the trunk or inbetween the back and front seats of the car.  Easy to clean which is a huge help when you are at someone elses home or restaurant.
I LOVE this chair!! It works well for my family because we already have dining chairs. It would be annoying to have a separate large high chair just for the baby. I guess my only complaint would be how easy it is to take off the tray. My baby could easily flip all her food onto the floor, so I don't even use the snap on tray tops anymore.
We've had this chair for 5 years and through 2 kids and soon to be a third.  We knew we needed something to save space and we wanted our child to really be part of family dinner time when we had our first son.  We strapped this on a typical wooden chair and used it as a high chair for a while when I needed to plop stuff on his tray.  I've always hand washed the part that clips on to the chair because it would take up my whole dishwasher.  The part that comes off would go through the dishwasher sometimes.  That was a pain in the butt when my kids got old enough they could pop it off and at that point I would just use the tray-my parents bought another one that set on and it made a HUGE mess with them flinging food everywhere because it was easier to get off from the time they were just starting solids.  We used it up to the table from the time my boys were around a year old each and they felt like they were part of the family instead of most kids that are in a high chair and shoved away from the table.  We've used this on short trips, at diners, etc besides just our home.  It's very easy to clean and very easy to transport and adjust to a new chair.  The only thing that doesn't clean super well are the straps-those are a bit stained but that's to be expected.  After 5 years it still looks pretty new and we still use it every day.  We even use it as a chair to boost our kids up so I can cut their hair.  I would not recommend any other like product-this really is the best out there and we've used several and different friends' homes and family's homes.
This is easy to install, durable and a great compact size. My daughter is 10 months old and expect she'll be able to use this for quite some time. We love it!!!
Bought this for a weekend with family for our 1 yr old last July 4th, 2010.  Our daughter is the first grandchild on that side of the family and they had no baby gear in their vacation home at that point.  I was visiting my parents for six wks last Fall when my mother was in the hospital and we used it every meal.  Made me second-guess the big Chicco highchair at home.  We have since kept it in the car to use at nearly every place we eat - seems high maintenance, but it's not and it's so easy to use/clean.  Restaurant chairs are so nasty and not always safe.  Our daughter would sit still in this far longer than any other since it straps her in and has the tray - very secure!  If we had a few kids I suppose it might be a lot to cart it around and use, but right it's not an issue at all.  I think waitstaff are thrilled to not have a highchair to work around or sit in the aisle, too.  They always comment positively.
We carry it with us if we go out or visit grandparents in a different city. It&#8217;s very convenient for babies that are not yet used to dinner chairs. And I also prefer something of mine at the public restaurants or party places. It&#8217;s compact, light and easy to clean and store when not needed. There&#8217;s no cushion, so it&#8217;s a bit uncomfortable for the baby to sit in for longer periods of time but then it wouldn&#8217;t be easy to clean. So, a nice high chair would be ideal to have at home for everyday use in addition to this.
simple and smart.  easy to get baby in and out.  easy to clean.  hard seat and back may not be comfortable for long periods.  folds easily for travel.  would give it 4.5 stars.
This has been a great little addition to our baby gear. Pros: compact, so it's easy to travel with and store, baby gets to sit at table with the family, the separate tray is very handy for food prep and cleaning purposes, easy to clean, baby seems comfortable in it. Cons (more like minor annoyances): tray is not very wide so baby throws tons of food over the sides, chair underneath gets very dirty unless you put a cloth under the high chair. It is really easy to put a cloth under the chair and wash that a couple times a week, so that is really a non-issue for us. No regrets on this purchase!
We had a Space Saver highchair for our first baby, but it got SO filthy and I couldn't get to all the nastiness in the grooves and things, so we got rid of it. With our second baby, I bought this and we've been using it for 8 months I think. It's wonderfully easy to clean and just as nice as the Space Saver, unless you plan to use it before your baby can sit up unassisted. When our youngest is done with this, we'll be keeping it for friends who come over with babies. It's just too nice and convenient to get rid of.
We have a high table with stools so we had to get a regular high chair for our son when he started eating solids.  However, we have a small condo and the high chair just took up too much room.  Finally after he turned 12 months we decided to just buy a chair with a back that matched our table so we could get one of these space saving booster seats.  It was the best decision ever!  We should have done that from the beginning.  It's so nice to not have a big high chair taking up space and this booster seat is much easier to clean and use.  The price was good here at amazon and I like the colors of this one better than the one they had at our local stores.  The blue and white and green look great with everything.  I like the blue tray because it doesn't stain.  We had trouble fitting my chunky boy in some fisher price high chairs but this booster seat fits him great and isn't too tight.  I like that it adjusts in height but we haven't needed to use that because it's perfect for our table already.  My only complaint would be sometimes I go to snap in the tray and on the farthest setting it sometimes doesn't catch on one side but ever since it happened once I just make sure to check carefully every time.  My son is now 19 months and loves this seat and feels like a big boy at the table.  I think we will be using this for a long time and he will be happy in it as long as he can fit.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a booster seat!
We got this table for grandma's but ending up taking it as a second one for our second little one as we flew back home. We have an older version of this one which doesn't have the removeable insert tray and lid, which are great features if you intend to take it in the car and also if you just want to make clean up a little easier. All I can say is that you don't need a regular high chair if you have one of these. Clean up is a snap and it takes up little space. I recommend this to anyone looking for a high chair now.
We have a Peg Perego high chair that worked well for the first month or two of feedings at the table because it reclined which was helpful at the start of feedings, but we have found that this, affordable, light weight, portable chair is the best all around. In fact, we like it so much, that we have one at each grandparent's house and keep one in the car for use when dinning out in addition to the one we use daily at home. It is easy to tote around though, so one will suffice, but for convenience sake, we found having a few a real convenience. We can also use the extras when other kids visit.The seat secures easily with two adjustable nylon straps and clips--one below a chair's bottom and the other around the back of your chair. We've used it on a variety of chair styles and it has always worked. The seat is simple and contoured for baby's bottom and legs and the entire seat has 3 easily adjustable height setting so that baby can truly pull right up to the table with the rest of the family (note, the seat must be removed from the chair it's on to make this adjustment, but it's rare that you have to change it, as the size of the child determines the best height, not so much the table or chair height.) The baby is secured in the seat by a 3-point harness made of the same adjustable nylon and clips.The tray is simple to put on and remove. It simply clicks onto 1 of 3 nubs along the side of the arm rests. The tray has 3 parts--a base, insert, and cover. The base attaches to the chair and we use it for every meal. The removable divided insert is ideal for messy meals as you can remove it, clean it off, and even throw it in the dishwasher. Lastly, it has a cover that snaps into place on top. We don't use this at home, but it's handy when eating out to contain any mess left of the tray (or insert) until you can get home to clean it. The seat's lap straps can be poked back through the seat and taken out to be washed--a big plus, straps are so hard to clean are are always getting dirty.
i dont use the tray top, but the bottom part is great in that it fits easily under the table (unlike my other high chair which claimed it would work as a booster but couldnt fit under any tables) and has a couple of levels to move him down as he grows taller.
This is a very portable, nice-looking, and sturdy product. The buttons on the sides are not as convenient as some of the models that slide. I don't think we've ever used the top tray cover (the green part) because 1) are you really going to put food on this tray, cover it up, and transport it? and 2) you're probably going to clean off the random chunky food bits before you take the thing home. My husband thinks it's great and preferred it to other snap-on models, however I feed our kid more and have to deal with its &#34;quirks&#34; on a more regular basis (i.e. he's been able to easily pull off the white middle tray by himself since he was able to sit up straight in it!), so my standards are a little higher. Bottom line: this is a good seat with a neat tray system and good height adjustment features, but the side buttons and tray stability leave much to be desired.
They're 2 straps use to tied down the booster to a chair. Make sure you read the instruction and do this properly.The 3 set of trays combo are great for kid to have food on.My baby is only 5 months and we started him on some solid and this is good. We have a boppy chair but he quickly outgrown that so we bought this. It';s a little bit lose on him so we put some small blanket on the side of each to keep him center :).
I read several reviews on amazon and this booster seat seemed like the ideal seat for me to buy.  I didn't have room nor the money to spend on a huge highchair.  I bought the booster seat from amazon when my son was 5 months old.  Attaching the seat to any chair is very quick and easy.  The trays are easy to clean (and yes a child will learn how to remove the white tray, which is not a big deal.  Just stop using it at that time and use the blue tray.) There are three different height adjustments.I have gotten so many compliments on this booster seat! I have taken this booster to family gatherings, restaurants, parks and daily at home.  Several people thought is was amazing that I actually brought a seat for my child instead of using the restaurant's high chair. I would pack a bib and baby spoon between the white tray and the green lid.  I have seen a  few other moms jealous that I have this seat!  My husband's cousin asked if he could have my son's booster seat, because they liked it so much and they never thought of buying it or he is too cheap to spend $20.00!So now my son is almost two and I have taken off the tray, and the green backrest and he uses it as a booster seat at the table. (which holds up to 45lbs.) I thought that I already wrote a review for this product, so that is why I am just now posting one.  I now have a another son that is 2 months old, and I will purchasing this same booster seat for him for when he starts eating solid foods.I have only seen this blue/green/white booster seat here on amazon.  But the red/tan/white booster seat can be found in the stores for the same price.  I really liked the blue/green/white and I like to have something that is not at the local stores.This booster seat is so worth the money and it is very durable.  You will not be disappointed!
We bought this because every time we ate out in public, we always got a nasty dirty high chair from the restaurant.  We now put our little guy in this chair and we know it's clean and safe. It also comes in handy when we visit my parents or in-laws house for dinner since they don't have a high chair. We put this booster seat in a chair and strap him in and he's ready to eat. Love how light weight it is and it's easy to carry around. Get it, you won't be disappointed
We've used this seat since our daughter was six months old.  She's now 16 months and it's still a great seat!  She loves climbing in, buckling the seat belt and snapping the tray on.  It's easy to travel with.  It's very easy to keep clean!
We have an eat in kitchen as well as a dining room.  We weren't sure initially if we should get two high chairs, eat only in one room while our child is in a high chair, or what to do!  A friend suggested we register for this as well and we have been very pleased!This chair is strapped to a chair in our dining room and we never have to fret about sliding the high chair out of our informal kitchen to the dining room across our floors.The fact that it collapses and can be taken along is extremely helpful.  We throw it in the car when we go visit friends who don't have children.  To be able to take along some containment for him is wonderful!  Also, the fact that you can throw the tray in the dishwasher helps sterilizing it a breeze!Definitely an item to add to your list.
Great product, excellent price, easy to cleanup, simple to attach to chair. Just a good product.  I seen reviews about people complaining about the seat being to hard.  What the hell do they eat in, a lazyboy, yeah probably i guess.  Dinner time is about eating, and sharing time with your family.  Not sitting in front of the tv or having your kid fall asleep in their booster seat because it has 8" of padding and made of leather.  Buy this, feed your kid, & have a glass of wine because you made it through another day.
So happy I bought this booster for my grandson.  It's well designed without being over-engineered.  Very easy to set up on any chair.  Straps allow you to secure it to the back and seat of the chair in a snap.  It will be great for many years of use, as the height adjusts easily.  Everything packs up into a neat, easy to transport bundle.  I highly recommend this for travel or use at Nana's house.  Very much worth the price!
We are very pleased with this product. We purchased this chair for our 14 month old baby boy and he loves it. We don't need to even use the tray. We push him under the table and put his food on his plate and he is so comfortable in it. We have actually taken it out a few times when we have gone to friend's houses and it is easy to transport. Great product and easy to clean. He has plenty of room to grow in it.
Perfect booster seat for my 9 month old.  Fits firmly on our wooden kitchen chairs.  Easy to install and stays in place.  The tray and seat is very easy to clean!  Highly recommended.
A friend gave me her Fisher Price Space Saver High Chair, so I used that for feeding my daughter from 6-16 months and thought it was overall pretty good.  I liked that it could sit on one of our tall leather chairs at our breakfast bar instead of wasting space on a bulky high chair.  I always thought the Space Saver was a hassle to clean and crumbs and debris got caught on the bottom of the pad.  After an episode of vomiting in the Space Saver, there was absolutely no way I could properly sanitize it with disgusting stuff caught on the underside of the pad, and into the trash it went.When I bought this Healthy Care Deluxe Booster, I fell in love immediately.  I like that my daughter can sit up straight and eat.  The straps buckle below the tray, so they stay much cleaner than in the Space Saver.  There is no pad, and so everything is completely wipe-able.  The tray insert seems useless to me as my daughter easily figured out how to pull it off and throw it on the floor, but the bottom tray works just fine.  I really like the smaller size and it has a more streamlined look.  She seems to sit more comfortably on this one and can rest her feet on the end of the bar stool since this booster seat does not take up the entire seat area.  It also folds down well, so we're taking it on vacation since we are renting a home that does not have baby gear.
We actually purchased a cheaper brand booster seat first and were disappointed and took it back to the store. I got this one and love it. I guess they make it in different colors as well. We live in a small home and don't have a ton of space for a big bulky high chair. This is what my 11 month old uses all the time. It is great and super easy to clean. I like that you can remove the tray for fast cleaning. It also folds down great for traveling. I've already used it on 4 different out of town trips and it can fit to any dinning chair easily.
This was one of the great "investments" we made in baby gear.  My sister-in-law had a Peg Perego highchair that she DESPISED!  They couldn't get it clean.  With their second child they switched to a booster seat and were never happier.  She convinced me to try a booster instead.  She is a smart cookie indeed!  We had registered for the Eddie Bauer wooden highchair because that was supposed to be so easy to clean, but (thankfully) we didn't get it.  I have a girlfriend who did, though, and she is completely jealous of my booster.I bought this particular item based on the reviews.  Everything people have said is true. I wipe it down quickly during the day, and give it a more thorough cleaning every night.  The plastic seat is contoured, and my daughter doesn't even notice that it's not padded.  She didn't start solid food until 5 1/2 months, and then we used her bouncer at first.  We never had a use for a reclining seat.  The 3 tray depth settings, 3 height settings, and the 3-point harness have given her plenty of room to grow.  The straps on the back and bottom are pretty long and have adjusted to every chair I've ever tried with no problem.At first I used the removable tray insert, but realized that I was having to clean that and the actual tray anyway, so I stopped.  When my daughter was older I thought that a sectioned tray would be conveient, so I put it back on - once.  It took her about 2 seconds to flip it off.  So for me, this feature was completely unneccesary.I have not used it to go out to eat.  If we ever get to go to a restaurant again I may try it!  I did take it on vacation, and even though there were boosters there for the other kids, my girlfriends were using mine when I wasn't.I did not attach the booster to my regular dining chairs at home.  I had a pair of heavy wooden barstools with backs that we weren't using so I put it on one of them.  It definitely helps that we aren't leaning down to feed her.  I keep one of those thin cloth diapers (not the pre-folded) on the stool under the booster seat.  I brush off the crumbs and just switch it out with a clean one every few days.  If there's a heavy duty mess I replace it sooner.The only thing that I don't like is that food does end up in the webbing and clips of the 3-point harness.  However, I don't think there is a way around this on any product.  Besides, it's nothing a little scrub brush can't fix.  I'm just the kind of person who wants to spend as little time as possible cleaning so I can maximize my time with my daughter!As an added bonus, I keep my barstool/booster combo in the kitchen near the back door.  Since the tray is usually in the dish drainer between meals, the seat is just sitting there.  When I am getting ready to go somewhere, I get my daughter ready and strap her into the seat.  It makes it easy to put on her shoes and gather up all the gear (purse, diaper bag, keys, etc.) before we walk out.  I'm not chasing her around with an armload of stuff - or the opposite - holding her while trying to get my stuff together.The next baby is on the way.  I am buying another one of these seats and putting that other barstool to good use.
This is awesome! Who needs a high chair! For the price, you really get more for your buck! It's adjustable and fits any chair. I am going to buy another to keep in the car for when we go out.I am glad I bought this instead of an expensive high chair. It just stays stationed on one of our dining table chairs so their isn't a bulky high chair taking about space in our tiny place.
Love this seat. My son is 18 months old and wanted to sit up at the table with us. I was able to put the seat at its highest and as he grows I can lower it down. The tray is easy to clean. It says its dishwasher safe but I usually clean it in the sink. The rest of the seat is also easily cleaned. Its sturdier than the seat at my inlaws and parents. I would definately recommend.
After my son turned about 18 months, we knew he no longer needed a high chair but he still needed a boost up at the table.  This seat is great.  It has three levels so it will fit at any table if you want to scoot the kid right up to the table, but it also has its own tray.  We really never bother with the tray cover, but the tray itself is pretty handy.  The chair folds up so you can take it with you to restaurants or someone's house.  We bought the red and tan chair and I love that it is not pink or blue but a nice color!  It takes up very little space, and I highly recommend this chair!
My son is 2 years old & we've been using this seat for over a year now. I really can't say enough great things about it & I recommend it to everyone with an infant. I originally purchased it for use while visiting family & eating out. The fact that it folds up & has a carrying strap is very convenient. I also like that it straps securely to the chair, has adjustable height & tray settings & wipes down easily. The snap on tray is pretty useless once they get old enough to pull it off (the tray underneath is great by itself), but it's nice that the cover snaps on when traveling to keep the tray clean. My son has always been big for his age, so I was concerned that his belly wouldn't fit with the tray on, but it was fine on the middle tray setting. Now that he's no longer using the high chair, we use this as a full time booster seat pulled up to our kitchen table. Even being used everyday, it's held up great & still comes clean easily. Now at 30 lbs, he still fits in it with plenty of room to spare. This is definitely a product worth purchasing!
This is good for traveling because it's reletively small, but it's bare bones for home use. There is no padding, and no between-the-legs post  to keep smaller children from sliding under the tray.
My 8 month old does great in this seat! I purchased two - one for our home and one for my MIL.Pros are pretty straightforward:- Easy to install on existing kitchen chair- Doesn't take up additional space- Super easy to clean- Portable so you can take it to a restaurant if you so choose- Comfy- SturdyMy sister used this same seat for both her children and her oldest still uses it. She's almost 2.5 and still fits great!
This is the best booster seat you can possibly buy.  We use it at our dining room table and take it whenever we go out to eat.  It is so quick and easy to remove, install, and carry around.  It's easy to clean, has adjustable heights, and is very sturdy.  My two and a half year old can struggle with all of his might and won't get out.  It should be on everyone's baby registry!
This seat is exactly what I needed.  My mother has one at her house and when I started keeping a second 8 month old, I decided to order one for myself.  It's smaller than my space saver seat and doesn't recline, but for any baby older than 7 months, I think this would be fine.  The space saver seat has straps over the shoulders that keep the baby more contained, but for the two 8 month old babies I keep this works just fine.  It's small enough to fit in any chair and works just fine in the floor the way we use it.
I am a grandparent & I wanted something that wouldn't take up  a lot of space. Easily straps on. Easy to clean. and great for their progressive growth.
I love everything about this booster.  I like that it has different height settings, so I can be closer to eye level with my son while feeding him.  The main reason I got it is because it's portable and can fit on any chair.  I love the fact that the seat has no cracks so that food can not get stuck in.  The only down side is that it didn't take my 7 month old very long to figure out that the tray is removable.
I have 3 children. I used a fisher-price healthy care deluxe booster seat with my oldest kid and used the "space-saver high chair" with my second kiddo because I had sold the other one when I had to move over-seas. I stuck with the space saver high chair but it was such a pain getting food stuck in the crevices and under the seat pad and not being able to pull all the way up to the table. I ended up selling it when I had my third child and buying another of the fisher-price seats. I'm very happy I did. So much better. It's easy to clean and it can be used easily instead of a high chair with a 5+ month old in my opinion. And just for your knowledge; my almost 3 year old climbed up in the seat and closed the tray around him when I wasn't looking and he fit just fine. Highly recommended.
This chair has been great.  It took our son a long time to be able to hold his head up, but once that was accomplished and he could sit up comfortably, he absolutely loves this high chair, and so do his parents!  It is easy to take with you in the car and to restaurants.  Our peanut was in some ways too small for a lot of the high chairs we came across, and this one made it so easy to sit him at the table wherever we were eating.  It is really easy set up as well.  One strap around the back, and one strap around the bottom and you are all set.  It is plastic so it is easy to clean up.  The tray is a little difficult to get on and off, but it gets easier with practice and you really don't want it to come off easily since your baby will smack it around. I highly recommend and do not miss not having a high chair at all.One thing to be cautious about is that it is only as sturdy as the chair you put it on. If the base of the chair narrow and the chair is not too heavy, your baby could potentially tip the chair on to which you strap this.
We've been using this as a high chair for our kid since he was about 10 months old. He's now 19 months old, and we love this thing. Fits on one of our normal kitchen chairs (so no extra stuff in our kitchen dining area), holds him securely, and cleans up very easy. Just make sure you clean under the seat every so often, quite a lot of stuff ends up between this booster seat and the chair.Additionally, you can just take this thing with you when you go on vacation or even just to a friends house for dinner, very portable and sets up in seconds.
I enjoy the versatility of this chair.  It is adjustable so that we can utilize the chair as he grows.  I love that the trays can be sanitized in the dishwasher.  It cleans up easily.  I wish that the center piece between his legs came up a little higher and would have liked the back to be a little thicker material.  I read the review and was happy that I picked this booster seat.
i've used this product for both my children. i cringed at the thought of bulky, messy highchairs and this is a fabulous alternative to that. the entire surface can be cleaned within seconds and the tray can be sanitized in the dishwaser. some reviewers write that they bought it to use at grandparents' house, but i've used this daily for the past 2.5 years with both my daughters. we put our children in this when they first started solid food--we have some friends who thought they 'needed' a high chair because it had more padding for really young children who are just starting solids. i had no problems with putting my girls in this seat as young as 5 months old--of course the age depends greatly on each child's motor skill development. this is a highly durable, great product! also, you can slide the booster right up to the table and have the child eat from the table verses the tray.
This booster is perfect. It cleans easily, 6 month (now 9 month) baby loves it. This chair travels well but it also used everyday at grandma's house. I spent hours trying to be sure I bought something that baby would be comfortable in, but was also easy to clean and use. This chair is perfect! There is no cloth to need to wash, it wipes down easily. The best part, you can't beat the price!
Bought this for my 7 month old son.  It was exactly what I was looking for and I love the fact it's compacted and can be tossed in car quickly.  The only issue, which is why it gets a 4 and not a 5, is that it can be hard to &#34;unlock&#34; the tray tabs.  I can't do it one handed for sure!  But other than that it's great and I've used it several times.
We got this booster seat/high chair because we knew we were going to have only one child and didn't have the space to have a large high chair. It attaches easily to our kitchen chairs and I've been putting our 5-month old daughter in it while I work in the kitchen for 2 months now. I love everything about this chair (easy to clean, height adjustable, sturdy) except for one thing (hence the 4 stars). It's hard to attach and detach the tray. It has three plastic "nubs" at different depths (so it can grow with your child) that you snap the tray over. You have to line them up well while attaching the tray. Once it's on it's on - it's not made for 1-hand removal. When she's having a fit and needs to get out immediately, I have a hard time detaching the tray and I worry about pulling too hard because I don't want to rock, or worse, tip the chair.We just started solid foods this weekend so it's getting easier to use as she gets used to sitting in it. I am glad that the white tray just snaps off so it's not messy to remove the blue tray. It would be the perfect product if the tray could just swing in and out for everyday use and completely remove for cleaning.
Great product, easy to assemble and easy to clean. Just make sure to put it on chair that is not wobbly. Great as a spare, for travel or if you are a grandparent.
In a restaruant or at home, these are a life saver with the twins. Highly recommend this product.
I am very impressed with this booster seat!  We transitioned to this one when our standard-issue high chair just became too cumbersome to position and clean.  The traditional high chair was more padded but I gladly traded that for ease of clean-up.  This little booster has everything I need:  adjustability all over the place and easy maintenance.  The straps are durable and adjustable, the tray positioning is adjustable, and the chair height is adjustable to three different positions.  I like the option of sticking the tray straight into the dishwasher for cleaning but I've never done that as it's so easy to clean just in the sink.  Also, it comes with a cover for the removable tray.  I imagine this can be used for preparing a meal for your little one and then sticking it in the fridge for the sitter, in addition to just keeping the surface clean.  So far, we have not taken it out with us to restaurants but I think we'll be doing that very soon as it was very easy to attach to our chair and adjust for a nice and tight fit.  The seat has a little formed bump area that fits between the baby's legs to also help keep them in place, in addition to the 3-point belt.  The tray does not extend out around the baby quite as much as a traditional high-chair but I don't see that as a problem.  The legs are reinforced on the bottom with rubberized grips to hold onto the adult chair or surface.Honestly, I wish I would have put this seat on my baby registry instead of the big, bulky, and hard to clean otherone that I wound up selling anyway.  I highly recommend this little booster.
We absolutely can't say enough positive things about the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster Seat.  Although I didn't even register for it at first, a friend said it was a "must-have", and boy, was she right!  This sturdy little booster is a workhorse, putting up with curious, sticky fingers meal-after-meal.  My son fits in it comforably and I love the convenience of the 3 levels, tray cover and lightweight portability.  I've taken this booster seat everyone - friends' houses, restaurants, vacations, and everywhere we go, we get compliments on it.  It's a great item for grandma to pick up for those special visits to her house - forget the high chair!My son has used his booster exclusively since he was able to sit up comfortably.  I highly recommend this wonderful booster!
This has been great for our baby so far.  It's sturdy, easy to put together, not hard to get tightly attached to the chair, and apparently pretty comfortable.  Our nine month old LOVES to sit in it!  He'll just drum happily on the tray until we bring the food over.We got this when our son was about 8 months old.  My husband and I were feeling very picky about high chairs whenever we looked at them in stores.  He kept favoring the really expensive ones for their sturdiness and comfort, while I favored the cheap ones because I know kids really don't use high chairs for that long of a time (and we might not have another baby).  I saw this on Amazon and thought the good reviews plus the chair's ability to "grow" with the kid by turning into a booster seat was GREAT. I mentioned it to my husband... and he said he wanted to see it in person first (meaning, we'd hunt it down in a store)!  Well, I decided I was tired of our indecision and ordered it.  I told him we could return it at no cost if we didn't like it, so this was an ideal way to see it in person.  When he saw it strapped to a chair in our kitchen, he looked at it, jiggled it, moved pieces, put our son in it, and loved it!Problem solved.  :)
Tired of telling my daughter to sit on her tushy on our big chairs during meal time, I got this booster seat for her to use.  It is easy for her to climb into, she can latch the strap herself, and it pushes directly up to the table.  I love that it has several options for how high to make it (I had a previous booster seat that did not adjust and it did not get her up high enough to the table), and it is really easy to clean.  I have never used it outside the home, although it does seem light enough to easily be portable if we wanted to take it out.  I think the price is right on this and it is very useful.
I have a really nice Graco high chair that was perfect for my son when he was not able to sit comfortably on his own for mealtimes (so I think under 8 months old) - it has a five point safety belt that securely holds baby in place and the base of the high chair is sturdy enough so that tipping is not a concern.While over at a friend's house, we used their Fisher Price booster seat and liked it so much that we ended up buying two, one for my parent's house and one for my in-laws so that we wouldn't have to cart around the bulky high chair all the time.This booster seat is easy to clean, the tray pieces can be washed separately, and the straps are easy to remove for machine washing (and air drying). It is very portable as well as the trays snap in to make the seat compact for carrying. Issues to consider are the fact that a kid could leverage their feet against the table and knock over their chair if you're not watching.Update: So now I realized that I actually purchased one for at home use as well so that my toddler could sit and eat at the dinner table instead of his high chair. I raised my rating... cause I liked it so much, I bought three!
