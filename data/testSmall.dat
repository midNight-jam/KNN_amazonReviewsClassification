+1	I bought this for my 4-month old son. He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it. The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra. The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby's musical skills.Cons: The battery didn't last long. We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!
-1	We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new "upgraded" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The "music" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again.
+1	Bought this as a gift because we love the one we own! By far the least annoying music making baby toy. We received a used one as gift when my daughter was 9 months and it has held up great over the years. Both of my kids love it too.
+1	We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old.  At first, he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music.  But as he got older, he learned how to play with it more.  He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones.  He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear.  I love that he loves this toy!
+1	We like this toy.  The corners are very soft and it is very easy for a baby to turn on and off. He loves moving it around the room.  A few of the sounds could be improved. But I would buy this for a friend.
+1	Has 8 recognizable tunes and easy enough for our 9 month old to figure out. Nice silicone-esque edging makes it easy to grip and keeps from sliding.
+1	I love this toy, and so does my 13 month old son.  He got it for his birthday, and he plays with it every day.  So far, we have had no trouble with it, and the batteries haven't even needed to be changed yet!  At first, he would just roll it to the orchestra side and hit that until it started playing.  Then he  learned that if he hit it again, the song would change.  So now he plays one song after another.  Lately, he has also started experimenting with the different instruments, both alone and together.  He plays with it for hours.  I don't get tired of hearing it either, because there are several different songs, and the sound quality is not irritating.  It's electronic, but much more pleasant than many of his other music toys.  Also, the tones of the instruments fluctuate a little bit, which makes it sound more like real instruments than electronic tones.Long story short, this has stood up to ALOT of play already, and we like it just as much now as we did when we first got it.
+1	I don't know what the "old" magic cube is that some reviews have mentioned, and yes it's true that the instrument sounds are electronic-sounding reproductions not actual instrument sounds.  I hesitated to purchase this after watching a video review on here showing the violin sound.  I have played piano for 26 years and violin for 23 so I might be pickier than some as  far as the sound.  I'm so glad I got it despite the negative reviews and it doesn't bother me that the sounds aren't completely authentic.  (I'd also like to note that the violin is the worst sounding one, the other instruments sound more like the real thing in my opinion.)  I love that you can hear each instrument's part separately and choose which instruments you would like to play together.  My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys, and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he's doing to start another song then go back to playing.  As he gets older it will be neat to show him that while each instrument plays similar but different parts, they all go together to make a pretty song.The toy seems very sturdy, although after several months of play the 'harp' button has to be pushed a little harder than the others for some reason.
-1	The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months, but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same.  How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments?  I guess they don't have actual instruments in China.
+1	I bought this for my 3-year old daughter as one of her Christmas present from Santa Claus, she is not that into it, I think this is best for kids age 6 months to 2 years. I was going to buy it on Amazon, happened to find it elsewhere for just a little over $20.
+1	Hands-down one of the best purchases we made.  My son fell in love with this around age 6 months and still plays with it at 1 1/2.  The music is lovely and it teaches kids cause and effect, and then how to combine melodies.  A really fantastic gift.
+1	My 9 month old son LOVES this toy!  It's not too loud and lights up with pretty colors.  He goes back to it time and time again but never gets tired of it.  I highly recommend it!
+1	The Mozart magic cube is an AWESOME toy for my busy little 15 month old boy.  It's one of the VERY few toys he will stop and play with.  He has always loved music from a young age.  He like to hit the various buttons and it is small enough for him to carry around.  It also can take lots of abuse.  My 4 year old daughter will play with it as well.  Really a classic must have for babies and toddlers.
+1	Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube.Nice music, interesting concept (one instrument per side). Baby (7 months old ) loves it. Good quality.
+1	This toy inspires me. I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound. Now he gets the full functionality of the toy. It lasts for years, offering various entertainments to various ages of kids. Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones, so we love this. Warning, it's very heavy. Don't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma's (we learned this lesson). The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety. We're never giving away this adorable musical toy.
+1	The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend's daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, "GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!"Love it!
+1	This item has been a life saver for me!  Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices.
+1	Our 8 month old loves to &#34;bang&#34; things so this is perfect. He moves it around, bangs on it and lights it up with music. Great buy!
+1	Love, love, love this cube. My 8 month young daughter loves it too. It never gets old and it's so much fun to hit all the different instruments, then listen to them all play in sync. Great buy!!
+1	I must say I'm guilty of purchasing anything that has &#34;Mozart&#34; in the name, since I love classical music and Mozart is my favorite composer. But this is the best toy ever. When I bought it my baby was a newborn, so mostly I played with it. But now my baby is seven months old and absolutely adores it. Whenever he is fussy, I just give him the cube and he forgets his fussiness at once. Best toy ever!
