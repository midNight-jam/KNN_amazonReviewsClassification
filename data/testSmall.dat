Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!
Helps me know exactly how my babies day has gone with my mother in law watching him while I go to work.  It also has a section for her to write notes and let me know anything she may need.  I couldn't be happier with this book.
I wanted an alternative to printing out daily log sheets for the nanny to fill out, and this has worked out great! I'm no longer searching my daughter's bag for a crumpled piece of paper each day. It's also nice to be able to look back on previous days and weeks for eating and sleeping patterns. I would have preferred a plastic-type cover, but it's held up well so far.
My 3 month old son spend half of his days with my mother and half with a neighbor while I worked.  I had them track his activity (loosely) in this which allowed me to get an idea of how his schedule was developing and how much milk he was eating.  It was the best way to have some cohesion in his life while I was at work.
The Baby Tracker brand books are the absolute best of the trackers that are available. You can track naps, feedings, diaper changes, activities, and notes. They're easy to use and have a nice clean layout.I started using the Newborn Baby Tracker, which tracks nights and days. It gave me a nice way to track feedings and note important milestones. Once I used up the entire book, I bought this Baby Tracker, which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now. Her caregiver notes her activities and sleeping times during the day. It's a great way for me to know what happened. Plus, it's nice to be able to look back and see patterns or trends.
I use this so that our babysitter (grandma) can keep track of what goes on during the day.  We've recorded so many milestones since we received this.  It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.  I'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book.
Has columns for all the info I need at a glance when I get home from work. Nanny is able to fill it out easily....love it
We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!
I've been using the baby tracker since the day my daughter came home from the hospital.  We're on the third one now.  It's useful for when the doctor asks how often she's feeding and urinating, but even better for looking at and realizing, &#34;Oh, she hasn't slept in x number of hours.  She's probably crying because she's tired.&#34;  But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule.  I flipped through a couple weeks and looked at when she seemed to be sleeping during the day and looked for a pattern, then started putting her down for naps around those same times each day.  It helps a lot.
I've been using this since the day my baby was born (1 month ago) and it is a life saver!  It is a great way to track when I breastfeed, what breast he ate from, how long, etc.  Plus when pee diapers are changed and poopy diapers.  Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day...so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all.  I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate, slept, or pottied.  I plan on ordering 3 more so I have enough to track this entire first year of his life!
I have used this book since my son was born.  It's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper.  Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor.  This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I'm gone.  They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I'm at work.  Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age.  I'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old.
I have used this tracker for all 3 of my children and swear by it! It is super easy to leave by the baby's changing table or crib and jot down things throughout the day (feedings, dirty diapers, nap times, etc). I also used it to jot down other important &#34;mile stone&#34; things that I would have quickly forgotten&#8230;like outings, temperature readings, visits from friends to meet him, calls to make, when we stopped swaddling him, etc. I was able to use it as a resource when (many months later!) I went back to formally fill out his baby album since I would have forgotten so many of those valuable little tidbits of information & memories.
GREAT journal. We use this everyday to communicate feeding, medicine and other needs when I don't have time to give my nanny the full rundown. LOVE it! I've bought two!
Great way to keep track of important daily activities/tasks when you are trying to get used to your new baby's routine.I include this as a gift to all of my friends now when they are having a baby.
THis has been helpful in tracking the feedings, diaper changes, naps and other developmental things for our little one but I REALLY wish they had laid it out so that you could leave it open and have the left side be AM and the right PM.  The way the pages are set up you have to flip a page to see a full day (starts with PM on the left and A.M. on the right).  It's a nitpick but if they had just let the user fill in AM or PM then the pages would be identical and you could look at a full day at a glance (with your hands full, holding a baby).  Sort of a pain to have to lean forward to pick it up and flip a page over just to see what happend prior.
if I didn't suck at documenting. Not sure exactly what made me think that I could keep up with recording every feeding, diapering, and sleep session. I was able to keep up with it for about 3 weeks...and then it fell by the wayside. I can really see how this would help with finding a schedule but I decided to let baby lead since we have a very flexible lifestyle.
My husband gave this to me as a Christmas gift as our baby was due in February. This is a great book to have during your first month of having a baby. With the restless nights and the nights blending together, it&#8217;s so easy to forget the last poopy diaper or what side and time you started feeding your little one. I used this book religiously for a month. After that, I just stored it into my newborn box. I will defiantly use it again for my next baby!
This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It's also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it's a great gift!
I find this tracker very useful. I've been using it for my now 3mo son. I keep it by my chair where I nurse him, so I can stay on top of jotting things down. It has helped figure out his sleeping and eating patterns - great!
Inside is nice and clean. Columns for diaper changes, amount feed, comments, etc. The time intervals are :30 minutes seems adequate, though sometimes I wish it was a bit more detailed. Also would have liked a ribbon or movable tab/page to keep track of what page in the log book we are at.  All in all, it does what is advertised and keeps us sane on what was done/changed when.
I used this for my little on and it was really nice for me as a new mom to have everything so well organized.  There was sufficient space for notes I didn't think, but all in all it was nice to have everything laid out.  If you're organized you could easily make one of these yourself and not spend the money, but when we had our baby I just needed one thing done for me and not have to do it myself and for that it was very helpful.
This is probably one of the greatest inventions. Before my baby was born, I purchased this and figured it's a nice-to-have item.I didn't realize until the first day home from the hospital how I would be RELYING on this simple, but easily organized log book. When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This book is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for the first 6 months. (I bought a second one after the 3 months one was done.)I used it to keep track of diaper changes and what kind (pee/poop), naps, and how long my baby nursed on each side. I also wrote notes for each day so I could see a history of reactions/milestones. It made it easier to figure out what gave my baby gas or why she slept better on certain days.Coupled with the Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Timer (which is also a necessity), I never really lost track (or my mind). It's also great for care-takers too, especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you! One of the most useful items yet.
Perfect way to keep track of the day for a little one-- this journal allows for detailed tracking of milk intake, diapers, sleep, and activity. Highly recommended as a perfect way to keep track and organize information in one easy to travel with place!
I did a lot of researching on what baby journal to buy and settled on this one and I did not regret it even for a second. This book is perfect! You can keep track of anything your baby does, from eating and sleeping and diapering to all the other things they do like first smile and first laugh. I only wish that instead of being 3 months it would be longer, like 6 months or even 1 year. I would definitely recommend for the first months of your baby's life.
My son's therapist brings this toy over and he just loves it.  He loves to move the ladder on the fire truck up and down.  This is one of his favorite toys and he doesn't play with a lot of baby and toddler toys (gets bored easy).
Both of my boys (1 and 2.5) love stacking and building.  They also love cars.  So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them.  They both love these cars!  All of the cars have a little &quot;surprise&quot; (the ladder on the firetruck &quot;clicks&quot; as it raises up and down, the siren on the police car spins, etc.) &amp; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older.  They're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest, bigger, biggest.
My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab.  The bright colourful colours really held her attention.  When she was sitting we played the &quot;Mummy stack them, Baby knock them down&quot; game and &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; with the smaller colours under the bigger cars.  They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on (especially the small green one) when she was teething.  At 2, she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over.  She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game!  Great for learning big and small, colours and numbers.  Good value!
I bought this last month for my 6 month old son, and it continues to fascinate him.  It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting. When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one!  He'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof. It will be a stacking toy later too! Great value for money...
This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.
For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.
I had a homemade quiet book when I was a kid and saw some on pinterest.  Since I don't know how to sew, I visited Etsy to see if I could buy one from that site.  I couldn't believe the prices!  I found this and ordered it for my three kids (9 mos, 2 years, and 3 years), and they all love it.  It's pricey, but it's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others.  Great book, and I love that all the pieces are attached!
I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it's an item that he can grow into and it's super cute!
I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future.
I got this quiet book for my 11 month old - for his 1st birthday coming up. He hasn't been able to play with it yet, but I was very happy going through it. I think he will have years of fun with this book. It provides several activities, which will help him practice skills he will be learning. It's also got bright colors and fun shapes that he is sure to enjoy. Can't wait to give it to him! Thanks.
This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.
My son loves this.  It took him a few tries to get the hang of it but its real simple for him to use.  When he bites it and it vibrates, he starts laughing and the tears disappear.
This was a favorite as soon as my son figured out that when he would bite it, it would vibrate. It either is really soothing or he just likes how it feels or something because hes 10mo old now and he still loves it...! Handle is great to put links around also to attach it to stroller or carseat!
my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.
It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.
My son loved this toy form the time he was teething until well after the time he got his teeth in. I plan on buying this for my daughter who is now 3 months even though she is not teething yet, she loves putting things in her mouth.
Great toy for teething! My daughter finds this very interesting especially when it gently vibrates and massages her gums. It didn't take her long to press down with her front teeth to activate the massaging action. She's enjoyed this just about everyday since we got it about 3 months ago. No issues with it! I sent one to a friend who just had her baby for when she starts teething.
thought would be a great idea for my almost 1 y/o...however, she really doesn't like it.  perhaps if i knew about it/introduced it to her when she was smaller she would be more apt to use it...she does like the rattle aspect of it and i vibrate her tummy, lol.  so it's not a complete waste
This is a great teether.  It is very easy for the little one to stimulate the vibrating action, making it a huge hit!
I like this product a lot, but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process... the product vibrates great, the colors are attractive to her, and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab. However, its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment. Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better. But overall I really like it.
Our son's occupational therapist recommended this for our aggressive teether. She thought he was using teething as a way to stimulate and calm himself. He liked playing with it more than he liked teething on it.
My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don't know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)
This toy was our go-to when my daughter was teething.  It really soothed her and calmed her down.  When her two year molars started coming in we got it back out for her and she still loved it.  We will definitely be buying another one for our next baby!
This works well to keep a baby busy. It's just too bad you can't change the battery. The battery hasn't run out yet though. I did buy this previously for another baby and I don't recall the battery running out for a long time.
My baby liked the massaging action but it took time for him to realize how to do it. When he finally did, the battery gave out nearly the same day. The battery would work in short spurts after a rest but I wouldn't waste my money on it again.
Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn't have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her.
