-1	This powerstrip cover is pointless.  Any child can get their hand in it and get shocked.
+1	Does what it is supposed to.  Basic and easy too use and little ones can't figure it out.
-1	My 15 month old daughter was able to pull this thing apart with little effort. I would not recommend it.
+1	Very nice it's was exactly what I expected. I will defiantly recommend it. I will be buying more in the future.
-1	I hate this tub!!! It leaks everywhere. I do not recommend buying this item
+1	I bought one for my God child who is 6mths old and she loves it.  I couldn't be happier;
+1	Really the best product for the kid . Soft and hard enough at the same time. WOnderful colors, great toys ...Love it till every little bit of it.
+1	LOVE this pack n play!! It is very large compared to standard pack n plays and the bright colors are refreshing rather than the normal drab colors.  There are toys built into the mesh walls which provide easy entertainment.  It's very easy to put up and take down.
+1	We love it. Great for the patio or when baby needs to be confined so gma can powder her nose. Keeps the dog and baby apart.
-1	With all the rave reviews and my love for Playtex VentAir bottles, I was very excited about this bottle. Yet, both me and my baby hated it. First off, the bottle itself is huge, which makes it uncomfortable in many ways. Second, even the slow flow nipple somehow seems too fast and makes my baby choke on his milk. In any case, we used it a couple of times and went right back to VentAir. I would not recommend it.
-1	Do not buy for glass bottles. Says nothing about this on the website but on the box. Very dangerous because gets so hot
-1	Had it not fallen apart after one wash, this would have been the perfect mattress pad.  It never even made it into the dryer.  What a waste of money.
-1	I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible. Don't waste your money.  Dr. Brown's is the way to go!
+1	I am breastfeeding but feel the need to have a back up plan in case I need to leave so I tried the Avent bottles on the recommendation of my sister.  My 5-month old daughter took right to them.  No nipple confusion!  They are the best!  Now I can be assured that she will be able to eat without me there!
-1	My baby never wanted to take them, or when he did, he looked like he was going to choke (even with the newborn nipples!), and was doing a mess, with milk dripping everywhere. The Evenflo nipples were cheaper and better.
+1	these are wonderful, they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets. no other bottle compites with avent!
+1	I bought other more expensive racks. This one is the best. Simple and goes with all kitchen decor, love it.
+1	I like it. It is nice. It sticks nicely. and soft. Not worried about baby's head hitting the table anymore. Thank you.
+1	This edge guard is very easy to put on and sticks very well. Its very soft as well. Would recommend.
+1	This blends well with our coffee table and kept my little one safe. The real test will be when we take it off - will it peal off the wood from the furniture ?
